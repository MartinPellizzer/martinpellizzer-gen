    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often consumed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
