    "intro": "Lindsaea divergens, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often split into multiple branches. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in its substrate. Lindsaea divergens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
