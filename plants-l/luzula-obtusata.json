    "intro": "Luzula obtusata, commonly known as bluntleaf woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are often clustered closely together. Luzula obtusata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
