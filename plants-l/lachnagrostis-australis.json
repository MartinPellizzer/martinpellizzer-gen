    "intro": "Lachnagrostis australis, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted for dispersal in coastal areas. Lachnagrostis australis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
