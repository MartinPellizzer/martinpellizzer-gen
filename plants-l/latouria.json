These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Latouria species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun. They are popular in horticulture for their vibrant colors and relatively low maintenance requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Latouria coccinea and Latouria multiflora, which are valued for their ornamental appeal."
