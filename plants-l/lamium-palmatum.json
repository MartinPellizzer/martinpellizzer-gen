    "intro": "Lamium palmatum, commonly known as the heartleaf plant or purple deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost heart-shaped appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in woodland environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Lamium palmatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
