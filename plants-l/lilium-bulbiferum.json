    "intro": "Lilium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically arranged in a fan shape at the base. Lilium bulbiferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
