It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves composed of 5\u20137 oval-shaped leaflets, which are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lupinus cymboides is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
