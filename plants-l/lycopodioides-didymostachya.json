    "intro": "Lycopodioides didymostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with upright, spore-bearing shoots that produce clusters of small, spirally arranged leaves. Its spores are dispersed through specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in strobila. Lycopodioides didymostachya plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
