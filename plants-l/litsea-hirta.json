    "intro": "Litsea hirta, commonly known as roughleaf mignonette, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and they are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
