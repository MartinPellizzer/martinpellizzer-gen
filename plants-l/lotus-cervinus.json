    "intro": "Lotus cervinus, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade for aquatic life and support a variety of insects. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Lotus cervinus is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
