    "intro": "Liatris alata, commonly known as the whorled blazing star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear whorled clusters of showy, pink to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in tight, spiraling patterns around the stem. Liatris alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
