It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. Lolium giganteum is widely used in pastures, lawns, and erosion control due to its durability and rapid growth."
