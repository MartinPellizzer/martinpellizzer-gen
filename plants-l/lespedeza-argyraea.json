    "intro": "Lespedeza argyraea, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters. Silverleaf lespedeza has a fibrous root system and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
