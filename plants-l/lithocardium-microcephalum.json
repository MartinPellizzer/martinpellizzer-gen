    "intro": "Lithocardium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed lithocardium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
