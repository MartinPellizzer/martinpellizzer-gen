    "intro": "Leopoldia cycladica, commonly known as the Cycladic leopoldia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Cyclades islands in Greece. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
