    "intro": "Limnosipanea guaricensis, commonly known as the Guari\u00e7ense water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of South America. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has finely divided fronds that help in photosynthesis and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
