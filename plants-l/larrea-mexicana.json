    "intro": "Larrea mexicana, commonly known as chaparral or greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. The plant produces yellow-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a resinous coating, which provides protection against drought and herbivory. Larrea mexicana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in desert ecosystems."
