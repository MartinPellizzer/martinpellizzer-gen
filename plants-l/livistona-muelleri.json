    "intro": "Livistona muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's palm, is a species of cycad native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
