    "intro": "Ligusticum brevistyle, commonly known as the short-styled ligusticum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
