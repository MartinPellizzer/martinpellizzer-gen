    "intro": "Linum alpinum subsp. collinum, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its fibrous stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Linum alpinum subsp. collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
