    "intro": "Lerchea fruticulosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed lerchea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, woody stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
