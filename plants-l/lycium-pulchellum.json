    "intro": "Lycium pulchellum, commonly known as the beautiful boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Lycium pulchellum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
