    "intro": "Lycopodioides rigidula, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its root system is relatively simple, consisting of rhizomes that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients. Lycopodioides rigidula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
