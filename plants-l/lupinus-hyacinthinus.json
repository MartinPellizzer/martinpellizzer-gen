It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds, which are enclosed in pods, are often used as a protein source in some regions. Lupinus hyacinthinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
