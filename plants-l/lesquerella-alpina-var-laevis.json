    "intro": "Lesquerella alpina var. laevis, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in fatty acids. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been studied for potential agricultural and industrial applications."
