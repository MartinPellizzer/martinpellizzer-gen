    "intro": "Lychnidea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps in reducing water loss. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting small organisms."
