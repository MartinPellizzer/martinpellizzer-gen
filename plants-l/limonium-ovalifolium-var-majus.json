    "intro": "Limonium ovalifolium var. majus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, an adaptation to its coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
