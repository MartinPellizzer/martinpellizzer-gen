    "intro": "Lepidosperma laterale var. typicum, commonly known as the slender spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense spikes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
