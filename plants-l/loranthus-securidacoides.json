    "intro": "Loranthus securidacoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa."
