    "intro": "Leymus korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
