It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of China. Lycopodium delavayi plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
