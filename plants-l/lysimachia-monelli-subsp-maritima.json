    "intro": "Lysimachia monelli subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea myrtle or coastal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its low-growing habit and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
