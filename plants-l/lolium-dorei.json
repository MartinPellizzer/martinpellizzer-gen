    "intro": "Lolium dorei, commonly known as the mountain ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Lolium dorei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
