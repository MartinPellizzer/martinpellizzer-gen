    "intro": "Lemna cherokensis, commonly known as the common duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the nodes along the stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
