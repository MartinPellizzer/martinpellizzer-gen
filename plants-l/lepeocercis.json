    "intro": "Lepeocercis, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems covered with a thick, fibrous layer of leaf bases. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually large, pinnately compound, and can reach several meters in length. Lepeocercis species are valued for their ornamental appearance and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
