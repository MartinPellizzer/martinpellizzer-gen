    "intro": "Lepanthes quandi, commonly known as the Quandi orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of many orchid species. Lepanthes quandi is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
