    "intro": "Lunathyrium liangshanense var. sericeum, commonly known as the silver-haired mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
