    "intro": "Lathyrus oleraceus subsp. oleraceus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
