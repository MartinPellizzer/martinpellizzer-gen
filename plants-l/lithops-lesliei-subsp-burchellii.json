    "intro": "Lithops lesliei subsp. burchellii, commonly known as the \"Pebble Plant,\" is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and collections of succulents."
