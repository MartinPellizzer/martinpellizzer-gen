    "intro": "Linaria caesia proles transtagana, commonly known as the Trans-Tigana skyflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Trans-Tigana Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often blue or purple-hued flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along its stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
