    "intro": "Lasiostoma loranthifolium, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered together, followed by small, round berries. Its parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments."
