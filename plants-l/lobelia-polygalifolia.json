    "intro": "Lobelia polygalifolia, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lobelia polygalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators. It is also a species of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to forest ecosystems."
