    "intro": "Lithocarpus hallieri, commonly known as the New Zealand toromiro, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain a single hard seed, which is dispersed by birds. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of New Zealand's temperate rainforests."
