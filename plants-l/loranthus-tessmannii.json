    "intro": "Loranthus tessmannii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
