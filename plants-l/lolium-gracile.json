    "intro": "Lolium gracile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in pastures and disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Lolium gracile is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in agricultural settings."
