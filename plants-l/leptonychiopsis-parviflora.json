It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, white or yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Leptonychiopsis parviflora is often found in alpine environments, where it contributes to the local biodiversity and ecological stability."
