    "intro": "Lepisorus ussuriensis var. distans, commonly known as the Ussuri fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved forest fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually through vegetative propagation. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, temperate climates."
