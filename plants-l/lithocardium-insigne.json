    "intro": "Lithocardium insigne, commonly known as the noble rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
