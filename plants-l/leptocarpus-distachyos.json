    "intro": "Leptocarpus distachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces distinctive, two-flowered fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to tolerate and even benefit from high salinity levels. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
