It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots submerged and stems floating on the surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
