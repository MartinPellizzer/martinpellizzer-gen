    "intro": "Lycopodioides wattii, commonly known as the Watt's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides wattii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage reflects its role as a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history."
