    "intro": "Lycaste brevispatha, commonly known as the short-pathed lycaste, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure includes a short, narrow column and prominent, spurred petals, which are typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lycaste brevispatha is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid."
