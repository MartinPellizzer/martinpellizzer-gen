    "intro": "Lachnostoma lasiostemma, commonly known as the rough-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, often reddish or brownish thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is commonly found on rocks and tree bark in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
