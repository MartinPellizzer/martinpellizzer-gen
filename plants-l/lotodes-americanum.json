    "intro": "Lotodes americanum, commonly known as the American water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the United States. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or mud. Its leaves are often covered in small, raised dots called bullae, which help reduce water loss. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
