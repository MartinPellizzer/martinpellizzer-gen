    "intro": "Lepidaploa mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's lepidaploa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
