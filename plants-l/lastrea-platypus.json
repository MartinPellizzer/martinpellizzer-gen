It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
