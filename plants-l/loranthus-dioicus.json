    "intro": "Loranthus dioicus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white, sticky berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves both asexual and sexual reproduction, with seeds dispersed by birds that eat the berries."
