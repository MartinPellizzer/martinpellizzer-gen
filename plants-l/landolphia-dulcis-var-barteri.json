    "intro": "Landolphia dulcis var. barteri, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed. The fruit is notable for its high oil content, which gives it a buttery texture and a mild, sweet aroma. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible seed used in traditional foods and oils."
