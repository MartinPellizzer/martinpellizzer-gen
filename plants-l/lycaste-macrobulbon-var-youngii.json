    "intro": "Lycaste macrobulbon var. youngii, commonly known as the Young's giant nightshade, is a hybrid orchid species native to the humid lowlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant fragrance. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shady environments. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
