    "intro": "Leonurus pubescens, commonly known as the hedgehog flower or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky flowers that resemble the bristles of a hedgehog, typically blooming in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name and aid in water retention in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats. Leonurus pubescens is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
