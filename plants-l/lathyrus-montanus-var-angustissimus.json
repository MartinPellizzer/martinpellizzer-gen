    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweet pea, is a perennial climbing legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees and other insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and woodland habitats."
