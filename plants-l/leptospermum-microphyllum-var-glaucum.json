    "intro": "Leptospermum microphyllum var. glaucum, commonly known as the silver-leaved tea tree, is a variant of the coastal tea tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, silver-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
