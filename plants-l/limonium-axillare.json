    "intro": "Limonium axillare, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Limonium axillare is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
