    "intro": "Lygistum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and opposite, ovate leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
