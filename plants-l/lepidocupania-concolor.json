    "intro": "Lepidocupania concolor, commonly known as the smooth lepidocupania, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Lepidocarpaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically smooth and lack any distinct serrations or textures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited geographic distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
