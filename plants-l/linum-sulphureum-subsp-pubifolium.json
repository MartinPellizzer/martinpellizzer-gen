    "intro": "Linum sulphureum subsp. pubifolium, commonly known as sulphur flax or yellow flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which are typical of the Linaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its hairy foliage, from which the subspecies name \"pubifolium\" is derived, helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
