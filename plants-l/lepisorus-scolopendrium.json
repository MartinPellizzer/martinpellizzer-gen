    "intro": "Lepisorus scolopendrium, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps retain moisture. Lepisorus scolopendrium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
