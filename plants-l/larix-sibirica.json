    "intro": "Larix sibirica, commonly known as Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tall stature and its ability to thrive in harsh, boreal environments. The tree produces cones that release seeds in the fall, and its needles turn yellow before falling off in autumn. The wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for construction and furniture. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
