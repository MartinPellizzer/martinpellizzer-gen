    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. aureum, commonly known as the golden privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are golden-yellow on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
