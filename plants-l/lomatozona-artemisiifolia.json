    "intro": "Lomatozona artemisiifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of wormwood (Artemisia). The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile compounds such as thujone. Lomatozona artemisiifolia is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional remedies."
