    "intro": "Loranthus pycnanthus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds' feathers, facilitating dispersal. Loranthus pycnanthus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for birds and insects while also potentially affecting the health of its host trees."
