    "intro": "Lastrea tenerrima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and coastal gardens."
