    "intro": "Loranthus cistoides, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds. This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various wildlife."
