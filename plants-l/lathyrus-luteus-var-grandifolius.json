It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces long, slender pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
