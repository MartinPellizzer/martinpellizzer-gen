    "intro": "Linanthus acicularis, commonly known as the needlestem flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, needle-like stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, linear leaves that reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Linanthus acicularis is often found in open areas such as grasslands and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
