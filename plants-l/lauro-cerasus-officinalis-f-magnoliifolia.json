    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus officinalis f. magnoliifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel or sweet cherry laurel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus laurocerasus and Prunus avium. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant white flowers that resemble those of magnolia, hence its specific epithet \"magnoliifolia.\" The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub or small tree. Due to its aromatic leaves and flowers, it is also valued in horticulture and traditional medicine."
