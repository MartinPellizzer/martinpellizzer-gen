    "intro": "Lepidium santacruzensis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its yellow or orange flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lepidium santacruzensis is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution."
