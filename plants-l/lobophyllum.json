It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble coral, hence its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and often have a lobed or divided appearance. Lobophyllum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flowers and unique foliage."
