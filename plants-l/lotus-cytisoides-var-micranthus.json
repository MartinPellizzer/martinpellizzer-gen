    "intro": "Lotus cytisoides var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind."
