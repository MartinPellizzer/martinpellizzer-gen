    "intro": "Loranthus rhopalocarpus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and facilitate dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
