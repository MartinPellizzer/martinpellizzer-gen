The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in low-water conditions. Its berries are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lycium dunalioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
