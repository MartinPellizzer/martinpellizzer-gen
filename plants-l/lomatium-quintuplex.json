    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lomatium quintupplex, commonly known as the mountain parsley or five-leaf lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, particularly found in moist, shaded areas of forests. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are white to pale yellow and attract various pollinators. Lomatium quintuplex is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
