    "intro": "Loranthus uraguensis, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host."
