    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the swamp lotus, is a variant of the swamp water-lily native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich mud. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
