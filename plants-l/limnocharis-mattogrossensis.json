    "intro": "Limnocharis mattogrossensis, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Limnocharis mattogrossensis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
