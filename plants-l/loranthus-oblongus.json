    "intro": "Loranthus oblongus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's stems are woody and its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects, followed by berries that contain sticky seeds. This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting various bird species that consume its berries."
