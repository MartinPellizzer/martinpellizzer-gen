It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or disturbed habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
