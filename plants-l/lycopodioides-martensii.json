    "intro": "Lycopodioides martensii, commonly known as the Martens' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodioides martensii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its survival in diverse habitats."
