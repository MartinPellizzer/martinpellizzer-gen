    "intro": "Lappa vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as lesser hogweed, is a biennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed and is often avoided in agricultural settings."
