    "intro": "Leochilus retusus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leochilus retusus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
