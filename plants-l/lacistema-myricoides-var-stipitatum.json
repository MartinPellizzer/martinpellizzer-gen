    "intro": "Lacistema myricoides var. stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lacistema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
