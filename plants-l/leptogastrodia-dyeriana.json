    "intro": "Leptogastrodia dyeriana, commonly known as the Dyer's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower with six petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
