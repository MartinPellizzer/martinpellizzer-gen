    "intro": "Lycopodium nemorum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Lycopodium nemorum is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
