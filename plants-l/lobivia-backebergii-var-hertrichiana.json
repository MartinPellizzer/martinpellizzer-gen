    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii var. hertrichiana, commonly known as the Hertrich's lobivia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical shape and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The leaves are usually small and may be present during the growing season but are often lost during drought. It produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
