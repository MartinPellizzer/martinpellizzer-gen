    "intro": "Loranthus virescens, commonly known as the green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and seed propagation, with seeds being spread by birds that eat the berries. Loranthus virescens is native to Australia and is often found in regions with warm, dry climates."
