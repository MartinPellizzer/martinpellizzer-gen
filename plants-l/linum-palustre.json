    "intro": "Linum palustre, commonly known as swamp flax, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Linum palustre plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
