    "intro": "Listera latilabra, commonly known as the broadleaf spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form colonies over time. Listera latilabra is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting early pollinators in forest ecosystems."
