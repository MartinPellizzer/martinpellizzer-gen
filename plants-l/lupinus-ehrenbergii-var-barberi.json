    "intro": "Lupinus ehrenbergii var. barberi, commonly known as the Mexican lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features erect, spindly stems with clusters of pea-like, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval, stipitate leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lupinus ehrenbergii var. barberi is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and its ornamental value."
