    "intro": "Lupinus blumeri, commonly known as the Blumer's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus blumeri is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
