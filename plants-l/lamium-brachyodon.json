    "intro": "Lamium brachyodon, commonly known as narrow-leaved deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or violet, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and garden borders. Lamium brachyodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
