    "intro": "Lycopodium densum, commonly known as the dense clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are scale-like and form tight clusters around the stems. Lycopodium densum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
