    "intro": "Loranthus capitulifer, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, spherical cluster of small, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a small, sticky capsule that releases seeds capable of adhering to the bark of host trees. This parasitic relationship can significantly impact the health of the host tree over time."
