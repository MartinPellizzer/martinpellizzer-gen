    "intro": "Lathyrus nigrivalvis, commonly known as the black-valved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant produces narrow, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive black or dark purple vein pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides. Lathyrus nigrivalvis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
