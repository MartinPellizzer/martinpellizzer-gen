    "intro": "Loranthus eschscholzianus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the tropics and subtropics. It has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while photosynthesizing for other essential compounds. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruit."
