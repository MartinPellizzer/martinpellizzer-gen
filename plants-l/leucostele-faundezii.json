    "intro": "Leucostele faundezii, commonly known as the Andean starwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and specialized vascular system. The plant features a distinctive leucostele, a type of vascular arrangement where the xylem is arranged in a star-like pattern around the central axis. Its habitat is typically in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucostele faundezii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and climate change."
