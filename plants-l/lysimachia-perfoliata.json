    "intro": "Lysimachia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist woodland areas in North America. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that often have a waxy coating, and its stems are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Lysimachia perfoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
