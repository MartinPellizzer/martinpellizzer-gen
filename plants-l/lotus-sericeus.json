    "intro": "Lotus sericeus, commonly known as the silver lotus, is a species of water lily native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically above the water surface. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in shallow water bodies, while its stems are rhizomatous. Lotus sericeus plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
