    "intro": "Lysimachia funkiae, commonly known as the creeping yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it prefers moist, shady environments such as woodland floors. Lysimachia funkiae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
