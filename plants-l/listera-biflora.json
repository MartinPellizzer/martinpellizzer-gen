    "intro": "Listera biflora, commonly known as the twin-flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, often forming a rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dark blue or black berries in the summer. Listera biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
