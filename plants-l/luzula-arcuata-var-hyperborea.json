It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, often in the Arctic and subarctic regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Luzula arcuata var. hyperborea is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
