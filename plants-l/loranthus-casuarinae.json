    "intro": "Loranthus casuarinae, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily from the Casuarina genus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also obtaining some photosynthetic ability through its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in coastal areas where its host trees thrive."
