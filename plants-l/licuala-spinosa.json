    "intro": "Licuala spinosa, commonly known as the spiny licuala, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen palm characterized by its broad, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. Its robust and spiny structure makes it well adapted to coastal and swampy environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
