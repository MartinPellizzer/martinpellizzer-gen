It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
