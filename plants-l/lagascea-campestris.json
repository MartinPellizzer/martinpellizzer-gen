    "intro": "Lagascea campestris, commonly known as the field hound's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both livestock and humans."
