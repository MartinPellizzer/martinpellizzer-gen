    "intro": "Leptinella pyrethrifolia var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
