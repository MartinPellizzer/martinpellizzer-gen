    "intro": "Lepidanche, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Nychthemeral. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor in the mud, while its leaves form a floating layer on the water's surface. Lepidanche plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
