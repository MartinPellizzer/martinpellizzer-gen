    "intro": "Lomatia longifolia, commonly known as the mountain lomatia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal and inland regions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lomatia longifolia is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
