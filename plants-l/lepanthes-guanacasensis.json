    "intro": "Lepanthes guanacasensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with vivid colors ranging from white to purple. Lepanthes guanacasensis plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
