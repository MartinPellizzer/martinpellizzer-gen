    "intro": "Lobelia nicotianifolia, commonly known as the tobacco leaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often velvety to the touch, resembling the foliage of tobacco plants. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
