    "intro": "Luzula pilosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
