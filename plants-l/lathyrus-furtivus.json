    "intro": "Lathyrus furtivus, commonly known as the sneaker vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lathyrus furtivus thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. It is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological significance in certain environments."
