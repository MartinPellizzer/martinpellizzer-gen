    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. foliaceus, commonly known as the leafy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree for nutrients and water. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are usually opposite or whorled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in a variety of forest and woodland habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
