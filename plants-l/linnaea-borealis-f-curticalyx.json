    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. curticalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twinflower, is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in cold climates. This form is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to harsh, northern environments."
