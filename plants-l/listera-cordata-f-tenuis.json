    "intro": "Listera cordata f. tenuis, commonly known as the slender heartleaf twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species."
