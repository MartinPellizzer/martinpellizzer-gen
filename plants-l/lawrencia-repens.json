    "intro": "Lawrencia repens, commonly known as the creeping lawrencia, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions. Lawrencia repens is adapted to coastal and inland areas, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
