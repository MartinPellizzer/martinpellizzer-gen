    "intro": "Loranthus subligustrinus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in woodland and forested areas."
