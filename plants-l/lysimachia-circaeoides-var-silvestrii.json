    "intro": "Lysimachia circaeoides var. silvestrii, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
