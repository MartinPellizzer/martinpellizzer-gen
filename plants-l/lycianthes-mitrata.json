It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds.
