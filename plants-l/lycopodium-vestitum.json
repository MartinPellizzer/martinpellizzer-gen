    "intro": "Lycopodium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium vestitum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and botanical interest."
