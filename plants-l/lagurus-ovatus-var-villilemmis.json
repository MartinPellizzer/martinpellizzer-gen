    "intro": "Lagurus ovatus var. villilemmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its small, white flowers appear in late spring, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lagurus ovatus."
