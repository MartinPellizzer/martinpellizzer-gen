    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus var. flaccidus, commonly known as the pale vetchling, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its reduced flower size and pale coloration compared to other Lathyrus species."
