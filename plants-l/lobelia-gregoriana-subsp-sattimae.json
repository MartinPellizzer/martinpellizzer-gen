    "intro": "Lobelia gregoriana subsp. sattimae, commonly known as the Sattima lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
