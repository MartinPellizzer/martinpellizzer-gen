The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are often covered in a layer of fine, powdery spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
