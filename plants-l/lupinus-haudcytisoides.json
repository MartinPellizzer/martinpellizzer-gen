    "intro": "Lupinus haudcytisoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated seed pods that contain several oblong seeds. Lupinus haudcytisoides is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
