    "intro": "Lotus aucheri, commonly known as the Persian lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, with a distinctive lotus-like appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several weeks in the summer."
