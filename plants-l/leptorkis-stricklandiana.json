It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
