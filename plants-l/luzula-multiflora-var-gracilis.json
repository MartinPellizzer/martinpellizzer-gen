It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white spikelets that are clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this variety thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and habitat conservation efforts."
