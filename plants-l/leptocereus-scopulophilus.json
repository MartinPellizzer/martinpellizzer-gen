    "intro": "Leptocereus scopulophilus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
