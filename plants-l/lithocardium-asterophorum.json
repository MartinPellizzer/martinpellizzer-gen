    "intro": "Lithocardium asterophorum, commonly known as the starflower of the rocks, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lithocardium asterophorum is adapted to survive in rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes."
