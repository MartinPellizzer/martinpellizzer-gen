    "intro": "Lespedeza striata, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. It produces small, oval seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza striata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
