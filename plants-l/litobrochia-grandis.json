    "intro": "Litobrochia grandis, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific rocky habitats in South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the dense foliage, making spore dispersal less obvious. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Litobrochia grandis is considered a vulnerable species."
