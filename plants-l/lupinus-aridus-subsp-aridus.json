    "intro": "Lupinus aridus subsp. aridus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Lupinus aridus subsp. aridus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species."
