    "intro": "Leucanthemum paludosum subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the swamp sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with opposite, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
