    "intro": "Lomaria pteropus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its unique adaptations allow it to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Lomaria pteropus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
