    "intro": "Landolphia crassipes var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the morning. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks."
