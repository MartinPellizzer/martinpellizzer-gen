    "intro": "Lathyrus cinctus, commonly known as the scarlet flax or narrowleaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are usually blue to purple, with a distinctive hooded structure, and bloom in early spring. Lathyrus cinctus is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
