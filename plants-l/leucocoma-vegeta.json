    "intro": "Leucocoma vegeta, commonly known as the silverleaf sprout, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, velvety texture and a pale green color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy slopes."
