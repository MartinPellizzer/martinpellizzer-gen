It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
