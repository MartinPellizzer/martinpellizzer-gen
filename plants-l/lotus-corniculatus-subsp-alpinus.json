    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats and is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ornamental or ground-cover plant."
