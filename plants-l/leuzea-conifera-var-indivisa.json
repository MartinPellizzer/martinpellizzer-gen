    "intro": "Leuzea conifera var. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leuzea, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stem. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of cold-climate flora."
