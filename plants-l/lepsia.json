    "intro": "Lepsia, commonly known as the common lepsia, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their square stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often aromatic flowers. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Lepsia species typically have small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to their ornamental value in gardens."
