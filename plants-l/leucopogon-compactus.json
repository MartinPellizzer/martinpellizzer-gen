    "intro": "Leucopogon compactus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the autumn season. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature in coastal and sandy environments. Leucopogon compactus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
