    "intro": "Lemna valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the growth of stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, influencing local ecosystems and water quality."
