    "intro": "Ligea richardiana var. exilis, commonly known as the slender ligea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
