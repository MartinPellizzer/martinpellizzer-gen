    "intro": "Lilium szovitsianum var. armenum, commonly known as Armenian lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its bulbs are perennial, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
