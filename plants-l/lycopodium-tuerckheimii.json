    "intro": "Lycopodium tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
