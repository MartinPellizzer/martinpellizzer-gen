    "intro": "Lamium purpureum var. exannulatum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside and produces small, two-lipped, pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along paths. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
