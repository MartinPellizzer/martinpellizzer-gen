    "intro": "Limonium sinuatum subsp. sinuatum, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and the leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray."
