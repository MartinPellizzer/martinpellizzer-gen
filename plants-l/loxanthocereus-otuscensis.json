    "intro": "Loxanthocereus otuscensis, commonly known as the night-blooming organ pipe cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a resilient and long-lived desert plant. The plant's adaptations to arid environments include a shallow root system and a waxy coating on its stems to reduce water loss."
