    "intro": "Lepanthes ligiae, commonly known as the silver star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a yellow center. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Lepanthes ligiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
