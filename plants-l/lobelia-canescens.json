    "intro": "Lobelia canescens, commonly known as the gray lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its overall hardy appearance. Lobelia canescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
