    "intro": "Leptopoda pinnatfida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features bipinnate leaves, with each frond divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
