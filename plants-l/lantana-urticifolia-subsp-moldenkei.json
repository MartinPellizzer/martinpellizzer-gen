It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its rough texture. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an invasive species in many regions."
