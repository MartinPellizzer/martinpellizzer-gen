    "intro": "Leucopogon cymbulae, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Leucopogon cymbulae plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
