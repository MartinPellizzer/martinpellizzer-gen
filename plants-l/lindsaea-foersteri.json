    "intro": "Lindsaea foersteri, commonly known as the Foerster's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are borne on specialized branches known as sporophylls. Lindsaea foersteri is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its presence often indicates a stable, humid microhabitat with minimal disturbance."
