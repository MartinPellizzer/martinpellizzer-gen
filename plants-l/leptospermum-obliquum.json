    "intro": "Leptospermum obliquum, commonly known as tea tree, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania and southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive aromatic essential oil, which is widely used in medicinal and skincare products. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its ability to regenerate after fire makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
