    "intro": "Lappa major, commonly known as greater hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive reddish stem that is often covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels, during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans and animals."
