    "intro": "Liparis rectangularis, commonly known as the rectangular orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves. The plant blooms with showy, greenish-yellow flowers that have three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctly rectangular in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
