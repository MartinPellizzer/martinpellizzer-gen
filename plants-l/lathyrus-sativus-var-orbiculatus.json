    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. orbiculatus, commonly known as the round-leaf grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its orbiculate (rounded) leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a herbaceous annual, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm. Its seeds are used in traditional cuisines but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities due to the presence of neurotoxins. The botanical features of this variety make it both agriculturally significant and botanically interesting."
