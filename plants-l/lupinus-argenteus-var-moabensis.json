It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall spires of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Lupinus argenteus var. moabensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
