    "intro": "Liparis rivularis, commonly known as the stream orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, often greenish or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows near streams, wetlands, or in shaded forest floors where it can access the moisture it requires. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes considered a rare or threatened species in certain areas."
