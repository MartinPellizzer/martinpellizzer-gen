    "intro": "Limonium lanceolatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. Limonium lanceolatum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
