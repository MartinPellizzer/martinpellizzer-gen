    "intro": "Leptochloa maritima, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to coastal conditions and is considered an important component of beach ecosystems."
