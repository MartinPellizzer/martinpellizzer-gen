    "intro": "Leptolepidium duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
