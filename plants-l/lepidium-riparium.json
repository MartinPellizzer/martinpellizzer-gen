    "intro": "Lepidium riparium, commonly known as water pepper, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Lepidium riparium is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
