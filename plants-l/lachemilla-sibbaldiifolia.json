    "intro": "Lachemilla sibbaldiifolia, commonly known as the silver carpet or sibbald's lichen, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense ground cover make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
