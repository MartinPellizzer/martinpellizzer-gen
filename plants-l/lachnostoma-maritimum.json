    "intro": "Lachnostoma maritimum, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in coastal marine environments. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structure and is often found in intertidal zones. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus composed of parenchyma cells. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Lachnostoma maritimum is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on rocky substrates."
