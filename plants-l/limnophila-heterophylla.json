    "intro": "Limnophila heterophylla, commonly known as water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphological adaptations, including its ability to thrive in both submerged and emergent aquatic environments. The plant typically has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that vary in shape depending on whether they are submerged or exposed to air. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in spikes, and it produces small, nutlet-like fruits. Limnophila heterophylla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
