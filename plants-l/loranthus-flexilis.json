    "intro": "Loranthus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in the canopies of rainforests. Its hemiparasitic nature means it derives some nutrients from its host but can also photosynthesize to some extent."
