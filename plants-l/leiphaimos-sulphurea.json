The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
