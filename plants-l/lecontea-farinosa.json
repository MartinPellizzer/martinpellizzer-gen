    "intro": "Lecontea farinosa, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.
