    "intro": "Lindsaea imbricata, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, overlapping segments. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
