    "intro": "Lastreopsis parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features dimorphic fronds, with sterile fronds being shorter and more robust than the fertile ones. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
