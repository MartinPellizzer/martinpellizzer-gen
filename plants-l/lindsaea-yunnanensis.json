    "intro": "Lindsaea yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan lace fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. Lindsaea yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
