    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wild pea, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a hairy texture. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and typically have a narrow, pointed tip. It produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks."
