    "intro": "Lagoseris marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, branched stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils. Lagoseris marschalliana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
