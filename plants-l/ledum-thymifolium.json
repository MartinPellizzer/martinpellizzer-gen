    "intro": "Ledum thymifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Its foliage is used by some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
