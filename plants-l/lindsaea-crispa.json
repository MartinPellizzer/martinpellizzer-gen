    "intro": "Lindsaea crispa, commonly known as the crinkled lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often curled or crinkled. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Lindsaea crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
