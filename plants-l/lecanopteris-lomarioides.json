    "intro": "Lecanopteris lomarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 20\u201340 cm long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Lecanopteris lomarioides is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
