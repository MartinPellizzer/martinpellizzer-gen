    "intro": "Lonicera japonica f. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible honeysuckle, is a cultivar of the Japanese honeysuckle. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and climbing habit, with slender, flexible stems that can twine around supports. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
