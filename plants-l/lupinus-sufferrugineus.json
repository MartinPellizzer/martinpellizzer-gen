It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus sufferrugineus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
