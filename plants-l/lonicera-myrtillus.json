It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lonicera myrtillus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping."
