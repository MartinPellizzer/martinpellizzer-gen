    "intro": "Lindsaea abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lindsaea abbottii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
