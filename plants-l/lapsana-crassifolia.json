    "intro": "Lapsana crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Lapsana crassifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
