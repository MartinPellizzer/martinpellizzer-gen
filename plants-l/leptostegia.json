    "intro": "Leptostegia, commonly known as the rock heath or rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. They are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and woody stems that help them survive in harsh conditions. The leaves are usually small and often have a hairy texture, which aids in reducing water loss. Leptostegia species are known for their resilience and are often used in traditional medicine in various regions."
