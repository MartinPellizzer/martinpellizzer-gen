    "intro": "Lathyrus armenus, commonly known as Armenian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, particularly in the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. The plant features slender, creeping stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its pods contain small, elongated seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. The botanical characteristics of Lathyrus armenus make it well adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
