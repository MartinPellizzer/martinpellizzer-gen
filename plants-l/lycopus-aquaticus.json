    "intro": "Lycopus aquaticus, commonly known as water horehound, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas, thriving in shallow water or damp soil. The plant has square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lycopus aquaticus is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
