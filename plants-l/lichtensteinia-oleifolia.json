    "intro": "Lichtensteinia oleifolia, commonly known as the yellow-flowered lichen, is a member of the Lichenaceae family. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks. Lichensteinia oleifolia is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
