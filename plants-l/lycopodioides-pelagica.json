It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Lycopodioides pelagica plays a minor role in its ecosystem but is significant for its evolutionary history and ecological resilience. Its presence indicates specific environmental conditions, making it a valuable indicator species for coastal habitats."
