    "intro": "Lespedeza formosa subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland edges and wetlands. Lespedeza formosa subsp. elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
