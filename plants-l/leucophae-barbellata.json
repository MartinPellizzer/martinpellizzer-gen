    "intro": "Leucophae barbellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
