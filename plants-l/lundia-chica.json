    "intro": "Lundia chica, commonly known as the small lundia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Lundia chica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
