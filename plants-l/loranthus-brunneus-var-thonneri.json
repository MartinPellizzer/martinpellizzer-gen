    "intro": "Loranthus brunneus var. thonneri, commonly known as the Thonner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
