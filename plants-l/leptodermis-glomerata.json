    "intro": "Leptodermis glomerata, commonly known as the clustered skin moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, leafy structures that are typically arranged in a tight, compact form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. Leptodermis glomerata plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat."
