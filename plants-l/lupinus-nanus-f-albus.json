    "intro": "Lupinus nanus f. albus, commonly known as the white dwarf lupine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is a variant of the dwarf lupine, characterized by its white flowers instead of the typical blue or purple hues. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
