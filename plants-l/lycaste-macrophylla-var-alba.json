    "intro": "Lycaste macrophylla var. alba, commonly known as the white-leafed lycaste, is a variant of the lycaste orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, providing a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
