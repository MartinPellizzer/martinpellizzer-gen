    "intro": "Laricorchis saragurensis, commonly known as the Saraguro orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the poor soils of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
