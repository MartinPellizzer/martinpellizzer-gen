    "intro": "Lonicera virginiana, commonly known as the American honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 6 feet and features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Lonicera virginiana is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and thickets, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
