    "intro": "Ligusticum pyrenaicum, commonly known as Pyrenean lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its rhizomes and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum pyrenaicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
