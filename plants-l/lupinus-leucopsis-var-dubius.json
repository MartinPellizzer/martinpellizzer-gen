    "intro": "Lupinus leucopsis var. dubius, commonly known as the white lupine variant, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in forage and restoration projects."
