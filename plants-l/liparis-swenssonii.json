    "intro": "Liparis swenssonii, commonly known as the Swensson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often clustered and adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches. The flowers are usually small and clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species."
