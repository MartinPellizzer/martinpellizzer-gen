    "intro": "Limnorchis major, commonly known as the giant freshwater snail, is a large species of aquatic snail found in freshwater habitats across Africa. It belongs to the family Lymnaeidae and is characterized by its thick, spiral shell that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The snail has a muscular foot used for crawling along the substrate and a radula for feeding on algae and detritus. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators. Its presence is often indicative of healthy water bodies with stable environmental conditions."
