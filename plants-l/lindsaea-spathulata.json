    "intro": "Lindsaea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Lindsaea spathulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
