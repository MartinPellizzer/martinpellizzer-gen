    "intro": "Lippia praecox, commonly known as early lippia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, mint-like fragrance, which contributes to its use in traditional herbal remedies. Lippia praecox is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
