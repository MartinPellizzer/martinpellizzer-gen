    "intro": "Lycium roridum, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Lycium roridum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it an important species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
