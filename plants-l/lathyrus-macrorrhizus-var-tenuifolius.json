    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf sweet pea, is a perennial climbing legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting nearby plants. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
