    "intro": "Loranthus delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay\u2019s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Himalayas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
