    "intro": "Linociera longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf linociera, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Linociera longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
