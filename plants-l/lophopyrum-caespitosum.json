    "intro": "Lophopyrum caespitosum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) foliage, which helps it thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind. Lophopyrum caespitosum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
