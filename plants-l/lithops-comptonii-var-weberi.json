    "intro": "Lithops comptonii var. weberi, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its unique morphology helps it blend in with its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores. Lithops comptonii var. weberi is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
