It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display."
