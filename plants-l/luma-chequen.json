    "intro": "Luma chequen, commonly known as the Andean mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a pulp. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to overharvesting, Luma chequen is now considered an endangered species."
