    "intro": "Lolium perenne subsp. stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping ryegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit. It forms dense mats through the spread of horizontal stems, which allow it to colonize a wide range of habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is widely used in forage agriculture due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment. Its ability to thrive in various soil types makes it a versatile and resilient plant in temperate regions."
