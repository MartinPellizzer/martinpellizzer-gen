    "intro": "Lupinus aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Lupinus aberrans is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
