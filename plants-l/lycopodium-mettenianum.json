    "intro": "Lycopodium mettenianum, commonly known as the Mettenian lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with dense, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium mettenianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
