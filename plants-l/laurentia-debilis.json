    "intro": "Laurentia debilis, commonly known as the weak laurel, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Laurentia debilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
