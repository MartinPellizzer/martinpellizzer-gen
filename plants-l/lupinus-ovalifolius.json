    "intro": "Lupinus ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clustered, spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lupinus ovalifolius is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
