    "intro": "Laportea cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves contain compounds that can cause skin irritation, though the plant is not toxic when ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
