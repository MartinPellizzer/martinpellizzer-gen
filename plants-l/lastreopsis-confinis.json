It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and can tolerate high salinity, making it a hardy species. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry habitats."
