    "intro": "Lepidium lignescens, commonly known as the woody cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems that become thick and branched with age, distinguishing it from other members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Lepidium lignescens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
