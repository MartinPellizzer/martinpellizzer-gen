    "intro": "Lycianthes sancti-caroli, commonly known as the San Carlo nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and the plant typically grows in shrub-like form. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in wild or semi-wild environments rather than cultivated gardens."
