    "intro": "Limnocharis emarginata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its roots are submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
