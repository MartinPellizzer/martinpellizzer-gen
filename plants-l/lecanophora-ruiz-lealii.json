    "intro": "Lecanophora ruiz-lealii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
