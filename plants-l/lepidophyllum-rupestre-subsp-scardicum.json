It features a compact, branching structure with small, fleshy, spiny stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or rocky environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
