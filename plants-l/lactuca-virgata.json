    "intro": "Lactuca virgata, commonly known as the common lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually pale green with a bluish tinge. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming a composite head that resembles a dandelion. Lactuca virgata is often considered a weed but can be found in gardens and cultivated for its edible leaves."
