    "intro": "Lobivia oreopepon, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a unique hybrid plant resulting from the cross between a Gymnocalycium (a type of cactus) and a Hylocereus (a species of night-blooming cactus). It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored, rounded body that resembles a moon, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant's true identity lies in its Gymnocalycium rootstock, which provides the necessary structure and water storage capabilities. The Hylocereus graft contributes the vibrant color and the ability to produce fragrant, white flowers at night. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
