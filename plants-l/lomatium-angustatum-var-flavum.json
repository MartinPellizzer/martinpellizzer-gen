It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
