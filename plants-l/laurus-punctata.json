It is characterized by its fragrant, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, black berries. Its aromatic oils, primarily composed of cineole, are responsible for its distinctive scent and medicinal properties.
