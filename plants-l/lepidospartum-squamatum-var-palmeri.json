    "intro": "Lepidospartum squamatum var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
