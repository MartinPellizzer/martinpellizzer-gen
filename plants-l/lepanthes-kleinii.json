    "intro": "Lepanthes kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with intricate patterns that resemble a slipper or boot. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes kleinii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
