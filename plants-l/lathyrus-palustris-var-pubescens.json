    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, trailing stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are pinnately divided into several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
