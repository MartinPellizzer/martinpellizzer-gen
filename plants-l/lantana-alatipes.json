    "intro": "Lantana alatipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry woodlands, due to its adaptability to various soil types. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its spread. Lantana alatipes is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and landscapes."
