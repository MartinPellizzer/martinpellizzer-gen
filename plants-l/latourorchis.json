It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and the presence of rhizomes, which help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.

These plants thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
