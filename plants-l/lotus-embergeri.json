    "intro": "Lotus embergeri, commonly known as the African lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple throat. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its roots are fibrous and can grow quite deep, allowing it to thrive in wet or marshy environments. Lotus embergeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
