    "intro": "Lindera glauca var. kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakamii ligustrum, is a variant of the broadleaf ligustrum native to Japan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery blue or gray waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
