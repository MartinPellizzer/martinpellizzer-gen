    "intro": "Loranthus schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host if left unchecked."
