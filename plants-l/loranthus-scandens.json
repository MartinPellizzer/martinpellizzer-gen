    "intro": "Loranthus scandens, commonly known as the mistletoe vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense thickets or along forest canopies."
