    "intro": "Lobelia paludigena, commonly known as the marsh lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and other waterlogged environments. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lobelia paludigena plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
