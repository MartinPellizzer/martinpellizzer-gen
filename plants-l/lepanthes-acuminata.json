    "intro": "Lepanthes acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes acuminata is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating water retention in its natural habitat."
