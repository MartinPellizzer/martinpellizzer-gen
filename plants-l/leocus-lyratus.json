    "intro": "Leocus lyratus, commonly known as the lyreleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that resemble a lyre, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, flat seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Leocus lyratus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and medicinal properties."
