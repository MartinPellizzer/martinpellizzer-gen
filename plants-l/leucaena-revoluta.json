    "intro": "Leucaena revoluta, commonly known as the wavy leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with wavy, serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Leucaena revoluta is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agroforestry systems."
