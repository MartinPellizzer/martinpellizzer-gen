    "intro": "Lobelia dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. Lobelia dasyphylla is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
