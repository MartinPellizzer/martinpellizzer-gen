    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. maximum, commonly known as the tall or giant ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 1.5 meters, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
