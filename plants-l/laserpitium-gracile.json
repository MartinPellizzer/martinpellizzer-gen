It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow ray flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Laserpitium gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in wildflower meadows."
