    "intro": "Lithops julii, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months. Lithops julii is well adapted to rocky, sandy soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
