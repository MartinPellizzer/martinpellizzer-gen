    "intro": "Lagurus ovatus subsp. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sweet clover, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, fluffy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and hardy addition to native plant gardens."
