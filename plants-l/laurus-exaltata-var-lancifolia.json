It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. This variety is closely related to the more well-known bay laurel (Laurus nobilis)."
