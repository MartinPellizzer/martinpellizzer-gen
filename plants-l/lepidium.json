These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The leaves are usually alternate and can be either basal or stem-born, often being pinnately lobed or divided. Lepidium species are often found in moist or disturbed soils and are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some species are cultivated as ornamental plants or used in traditional medicine."
