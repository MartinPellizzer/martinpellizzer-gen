    "intro": "Lobivia thionantha var. ferrarii, commonly known as the Ferrari's lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
