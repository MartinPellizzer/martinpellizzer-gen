    "intro": "Lupinus rickeri, commonly known as the Ricker's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus rickeri is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
