    "intro": "Lepisorus onoei, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Lepisorus onoei is native to East Asia, including regions of Japan, China, and Korea."
