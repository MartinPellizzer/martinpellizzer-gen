    "intro": "Liriosma cerifera, commonly known as the candle plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes many ornamental and aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Liriosma cerifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, moist environments."
