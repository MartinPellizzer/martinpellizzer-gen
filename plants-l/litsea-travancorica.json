    "intro": "Litsea travancorica, commonly known as Travancore litsea, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by elliptical, woody drupes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
