It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright shoots, which contribute to its spreading growth habit. Lindsaea parallelogramma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
