    "intro": "Lithodora moroccana, commonly known as Moroccan bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Morocco. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Lithodora moroccana is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
