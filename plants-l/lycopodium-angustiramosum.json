    "intro": "Lycopodium angustiramosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically clustered in small, rounded structures. Lycopodium angustiramosum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
