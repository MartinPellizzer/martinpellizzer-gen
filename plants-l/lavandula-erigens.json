    "intro": "Lavandula erigens, commonly known as Spanish lavender, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It features upright, woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to pinkish-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in linalool and lavandin, are widely used in aromatherapy and perfumery."
