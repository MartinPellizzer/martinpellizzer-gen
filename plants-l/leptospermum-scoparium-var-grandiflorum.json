    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a variant of the native New Zealand tea tree. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
