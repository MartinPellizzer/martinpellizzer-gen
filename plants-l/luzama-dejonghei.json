    "intro": "Luzama dejonghei, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
