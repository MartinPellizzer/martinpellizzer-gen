    "intro": "Lachanodes pladaroxylon, commonly known as the sweetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are large, simple, and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in panicles, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
