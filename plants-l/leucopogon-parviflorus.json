It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, elliptical berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Leucopogon parviflorus is often found in wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures."
