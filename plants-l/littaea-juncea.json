    "intro": "Littaea juncea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Littaea juncea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal soils."
