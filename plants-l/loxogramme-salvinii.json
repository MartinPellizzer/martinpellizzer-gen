    "intro": "Loxogramme salvinii, commonly known as the water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, overlapping lobes, resembling the shape of a clover leaf. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and along the edges of streams. Loxogramme salvinii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to various aquatic organisms."
