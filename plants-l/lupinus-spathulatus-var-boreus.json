    "intro": "Lupinus spathulatus var. boreus, commonly known as the Arctic lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and compound leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Lupinus spathulatus var. boreus plays an important role in stabilizing Arctic soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
