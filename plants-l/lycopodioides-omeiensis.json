    "intro": "Lycopodioides omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a compact, creeping growth habit. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycopodioides omeiensis is considered a valuable indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems."
