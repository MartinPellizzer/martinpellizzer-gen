    "intro": "Limonium lagostanum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters. Limonium lagostanum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions."
