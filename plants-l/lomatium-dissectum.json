    "intro": "Lomatium dissectum, commonly known as the fernleaf lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its roots are often harvested for medicinal use. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. Lomatium dissectum is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects."
