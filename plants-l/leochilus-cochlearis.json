    "intro": "Leochilus cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
