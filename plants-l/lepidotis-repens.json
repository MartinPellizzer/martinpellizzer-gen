    "intro": "Lepidotis repens, commonly known as the creeping lepidotis, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it its genus name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens."
