    "intro": "Liabum liaboides, commonly known as the slender liabum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Liabum liaboides is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
