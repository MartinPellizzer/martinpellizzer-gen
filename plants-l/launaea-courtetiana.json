    "intro": "Launaea courtetiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial with a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and often lobed, adapted to reduce water loss. Launaea courtetiana is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
