It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, white or pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in a composite head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
