    "intro": "Loranthus sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the globe-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, and derives its nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, round berries that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Loranthus sphaerocarpus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
