It features heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, white, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it spreads through rhizomes. Listera grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
