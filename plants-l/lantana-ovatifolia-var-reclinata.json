    "intro": "Lantana ovatifolia var. reclinata, commonly known as the hanging lantana, is a compact, trailing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant has opposite, ovate-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing habit. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
