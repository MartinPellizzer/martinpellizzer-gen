    "intro": "Lagotis glauca f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bluebell, is a variant of the bluebell plant characterized by its pale blue or white flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The white-flowered form is less common than the typical blue-flowered variety, adding unique ornamental value to its habitat."
