    "intro": "Lupinus cuzcensis, commonly known as the Cuzco lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus cuzcensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in its native habitat."
