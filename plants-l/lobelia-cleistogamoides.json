    "intro": "Lobelia cleistogamoides, commonly known as the cleistogamous lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinating and remain closed, while the open flowers are typically visited by insects. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
