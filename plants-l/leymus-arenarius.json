    "intro": "Leymus arenarius, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, including coastal dunes and dry, nutrient-poor habitats. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively. Leymus arenarius plays a vital role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
