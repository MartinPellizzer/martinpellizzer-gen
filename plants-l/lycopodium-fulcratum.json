    "intro": "Lycopodium fulcratum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from cone-like structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Lycopodium fulcratum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
