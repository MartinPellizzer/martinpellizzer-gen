    "intro": "Loranthus sabaensis, commonly known as the Saba mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
