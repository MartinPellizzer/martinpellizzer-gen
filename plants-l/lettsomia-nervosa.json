    "intro": "Lettsomia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a central, unbranched rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, which help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Lettsomia nervosa thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with high humidity."
