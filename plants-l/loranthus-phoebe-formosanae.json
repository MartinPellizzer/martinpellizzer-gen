    "intro": "Loranthus phoebe-formosanae, commonly known as the Formosan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily members of the Lauraceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Taiwan and is an important component of the region's ecological system."
