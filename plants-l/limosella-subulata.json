    "intro": "Limosella subulata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal habitats in Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in a rosette, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Limosella subulata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in coastal dunes and sandy areas."
