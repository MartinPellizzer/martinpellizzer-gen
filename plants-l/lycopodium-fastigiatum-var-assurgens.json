    "intro": "Lycopodium fastigiatum var. assurgens, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
