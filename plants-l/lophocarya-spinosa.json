    "intro": "Lophocarya spinosa, commonly known as the spiny alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and have a distinctive spiny appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Lophocarya spinosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
