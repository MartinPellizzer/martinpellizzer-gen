    "intro": "Ligularia brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens."
