    "intro": "Lobivia pygmaea var. minor, commonly known as the miniature lobivia, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and a dense covering of white to pale blue hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
