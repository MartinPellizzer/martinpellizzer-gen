    "intro": "Lythrum prostratum, commonly known as swamp willow or prostrate lythrum, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer. Lythrum prostratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
