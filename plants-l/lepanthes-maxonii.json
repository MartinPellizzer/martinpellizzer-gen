    "intro": "Lepanthes maxonii, commonly known as the Maxon's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a mix of white and purple hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found in the canopy of humid forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes maxonii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
