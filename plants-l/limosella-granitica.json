    "intro": "Limosella granitica, commonly known as the granite sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil nutrients. Its succulent stems and leaves help store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats. Limosella granitica plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas."
