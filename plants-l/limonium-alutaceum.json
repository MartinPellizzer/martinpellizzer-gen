It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Limonium alutaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
