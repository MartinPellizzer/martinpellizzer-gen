    "intro": "Leontopodium \u00d7 lindavicum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a hybrid plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or pale yellow hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and association with the Alps, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and purity."
