    "intro": "Lithocarpus spicatus, commonly known as the spicate stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its hard, woody fruit that resembles a chestnut, containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and have a glossy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its tropical habitat. Lithocarpus spicatus plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
