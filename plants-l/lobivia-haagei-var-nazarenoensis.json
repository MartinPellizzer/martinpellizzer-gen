    "intro": "Lobivia haagei var. nazarenoensis, commonly known as the Nazarenoensis Lobivia, is a rare and compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
