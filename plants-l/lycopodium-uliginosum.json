    "intro": "Lycopodium uliginosum, commonly known as the bog huckleweed, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It has delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family, which includes clubmosses and other ancient plant groups. Lycopodium uliginosum plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
