    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum subsp. periclymenum, commonly known as the common honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red. The flowers are borne in clusters and are an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks."
