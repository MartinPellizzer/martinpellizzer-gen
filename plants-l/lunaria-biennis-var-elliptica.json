    "intro": "Lunaria biennis var. elliptica, commonly known as the moonflower or devil's-bit scabious, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking, rounded, papery blue or purple seed pods that remain on the plant well into winter, adding ornamental value. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its unique seed pods and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats."
