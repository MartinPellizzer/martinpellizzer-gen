    "intro": "Leontopodium leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a symbol of resilience. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is protected in many regions to prevent overharvesting."
