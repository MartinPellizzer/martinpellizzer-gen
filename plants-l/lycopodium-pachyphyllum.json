    "intro": "Lycopodium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the stems. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodium pachyphyllum is also valued for its ability to form dense ground cover in woodland settings."
