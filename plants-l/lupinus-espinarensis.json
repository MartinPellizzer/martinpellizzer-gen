It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Lupinus espinarensis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
