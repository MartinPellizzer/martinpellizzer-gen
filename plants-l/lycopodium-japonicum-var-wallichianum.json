    "intro": "Lycopodium japonicum var. wallichianum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the Himalayas and parts of East Asia. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its branching stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to form dense ground covers."
