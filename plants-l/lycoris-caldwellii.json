It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Its botanical name honors the botanist Robert Caldwell, who contributed significantly to the study of Chinese flora. Lycoris caldwellii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with partial shade."
