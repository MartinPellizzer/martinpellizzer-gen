    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus subsp. arcticus, commonly known as Arctic lupine, is a perennial legume native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Lupinus arcticus subsp. arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for herbivores in its harsh environment."
