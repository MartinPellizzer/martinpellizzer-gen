    "intro": "Lecosia, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble small cups, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and marshes, and is native to regions of North America. Lecosia species are herbaceous perennials with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are not only visually appealing but also attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
