    "intro": "Liparis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
