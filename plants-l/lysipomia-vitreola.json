    "intro": "Lysipomia vitreola, commonly known as the glassy lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in a waxy, glass-like coating, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Lysipomia vitreola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
