    "intro": "Lysimachia millietii, commonly known as the silverleaf mosquito plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Lysimachia millietii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Chinese medicine."
