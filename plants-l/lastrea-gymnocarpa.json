    "intro": "Lastrea gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded lastrea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by smooth, spherical fruits. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
