    "intro": "Lithomyrtus retusa, commonly known as the silver leaf holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in a fine layer of silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue when dry. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
