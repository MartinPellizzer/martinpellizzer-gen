    "intro": "Lamium bifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, slightly heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lamium bifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
