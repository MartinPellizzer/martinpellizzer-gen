    "intro": "Licania subarachnophylla, commonly known as the spider-scale tree, is a flowering plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its bark is often covered in a fibrous, woody texture. Licania subarachnophylla is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of the understory in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
