    "intro": "Leymus pseudoagropyrum, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which becomes more yellowish in maturity. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Leymus pseudoagropyrum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology projects."
