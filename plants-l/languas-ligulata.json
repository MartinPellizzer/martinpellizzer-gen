    "intro": "Languas ligulata, commonly known as the flat leaf or ligulate plant, is a flowering plant characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are broad and have a distinctive, flat structure that helps in water absorption. Languas ligulata is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
