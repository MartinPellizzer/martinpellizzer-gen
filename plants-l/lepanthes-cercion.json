It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically feature a combination of red, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes cercion is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
