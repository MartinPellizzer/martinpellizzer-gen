    "intro": "Lysimandra, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Lysimandra species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them float and reduce water loss. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, where they absorb nutrients. The flowers of Lysimandra are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
