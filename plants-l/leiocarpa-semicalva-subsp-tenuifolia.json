It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
