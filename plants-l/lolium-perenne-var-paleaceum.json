    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. paleaceum, commonly known as pale oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
