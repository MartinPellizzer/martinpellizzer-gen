    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. exsertum-furcatum, commonly known as the furcate clubmoss, is a fern ally characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features tall, unbranched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The sporophylls are elongated and often have a furcate (forked) appearance, giving the plant its common name. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of the stems, producing spores for propagation."
