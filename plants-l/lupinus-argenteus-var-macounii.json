    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus var. macounii, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and spires of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects. The variety macounii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of Lupinus argenteus."
