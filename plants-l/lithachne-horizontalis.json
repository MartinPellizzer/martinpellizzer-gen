    "intro": "Lithachne horizontalis, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Lithachne horizontalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
