    "intro": "Lathyrus rothii, commonly known as Roth's vetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces pea-like flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that mature in the fall. Lathyrus rothii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions."
