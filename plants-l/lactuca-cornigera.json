    "intro": "Lactuca cornigera, commonly known as the horned lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Lactuca cornigera is also known for its milky sap, which contains compounds that can cause skin irritation."
