    "intro": "Leucadendron royenifolium, commonly known as the Royal Crown firethorn, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often forming a dense, spherical inflorescence. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, almost feather-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated for its visual appeal in both garden settings and as a cut flower."
