    "intro": "Lobularia fruticosa, commonly known as sweet Alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Lobularia fruticosa is also known for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
