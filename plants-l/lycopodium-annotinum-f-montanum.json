It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth and needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate mountain ecosystems."
