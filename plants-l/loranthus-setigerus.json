    "intro": "Loranthus setigerus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees and begin new infections. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia."
