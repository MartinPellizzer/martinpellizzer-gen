    "intro": "Libanotis abolinii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
