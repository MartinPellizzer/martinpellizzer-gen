    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved Labrador tea, is a variant of the Labrador tea plant native to northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wetland or bog environments."
