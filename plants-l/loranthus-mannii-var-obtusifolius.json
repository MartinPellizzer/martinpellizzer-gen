    "intro": "Loranthus mannii var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia. It possesses scale-like leaves that are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host trees."
