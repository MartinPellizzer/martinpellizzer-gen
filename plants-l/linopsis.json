These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy environments. Linopsis species are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads, giving them a distinctive appearance. The flowers are usually small and yellow or orange, arranged in compact clusters. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
