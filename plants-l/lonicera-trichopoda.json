    "intro": "Lonicera trichopoda, commonly known as the woolly honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. Lonicera trichopoda is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
