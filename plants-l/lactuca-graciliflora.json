    "intro": "Lactuca graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Lactuca graciliflora is often found in temperate climates and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
