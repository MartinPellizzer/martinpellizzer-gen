    "intro": "Lonicera glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a sticky coating, which gives the plant its common name. Lonicera glutinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
