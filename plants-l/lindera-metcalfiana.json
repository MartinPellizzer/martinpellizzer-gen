    "intro": "Lindera metcalfiana, commonly known as Metcalf's spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. Its foliage is often fragrant when crushed, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun in moist, well-drained soils. Lindera metcalfiana is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
