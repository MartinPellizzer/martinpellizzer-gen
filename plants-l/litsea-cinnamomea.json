    "intro": "Litsea cinnamomea, commonly known as the Chinese-laurel or cinnamon tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that emit a pleasant, spicy scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Its ornamental value and fragrance make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
