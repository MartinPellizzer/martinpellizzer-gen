    "intro": "Loasa filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved loasa, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that resemble fern fronds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Loasa filicifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
