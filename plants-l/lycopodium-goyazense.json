    "intro": "Lycopodium goyazense, commonly known as the Goyazense clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, and often densely branched stems covered with spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lycopodium goyazense plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
