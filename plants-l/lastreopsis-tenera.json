    "intro": "Lastreopsis tenera, commonly known as the slender rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has hairy, succulent stems and linear, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. Lastreopsis tenera is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
