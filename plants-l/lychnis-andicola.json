    "intro": "Lychnis andicola, commonly known as the Andean fireweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its striking red to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lychnis andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
