    "intro": "Laguna spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh fern, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in early spring. Laguna spathulata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
