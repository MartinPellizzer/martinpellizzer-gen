    "intro": "Lupinus nootkatensis var. kjellmanii, commonly known as the Alaska lupine, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heath and tundra habitats. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
