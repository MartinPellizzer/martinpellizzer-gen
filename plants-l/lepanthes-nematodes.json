    "intro": "Lepanthes nematodes, commonly known as ghost orchids, are epiphytic plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. They are characterized by their lack of leaves and their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through their roots. These plants typically grow on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Their flowers are often white or pale in color, with intricate, delicate structures. Lepanthes nematodes are found primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America."
