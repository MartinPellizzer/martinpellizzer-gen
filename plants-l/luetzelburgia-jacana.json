It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like fruits that help it disperse across water bodies. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that remain above the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water environments, allowing for efficient seed dispersal. Luetzelburgia jacana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
