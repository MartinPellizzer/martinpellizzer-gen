    "intro": "Leucostegane grandis, commonly known as the large-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in environments with partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Leucostegane grandis plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
