    "intro": "Leptogramma caudata, commonly known as the cat's-tail fern, is a unique evergreen plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette of leathery, dark green leaves that resemble a cat's tail. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking foliage. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is considered a rare and exotic plant in many regions."
