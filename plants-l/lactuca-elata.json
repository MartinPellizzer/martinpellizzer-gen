    "intro": "Lactuca elata, commonly known as common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by achene fruits enclosed in a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Lactuca elata contains lactucin and other lactucosides, which give it a bitter taste and have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
