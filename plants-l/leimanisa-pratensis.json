    "intro": "Leimanisa pratensis, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Leimanisa pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
