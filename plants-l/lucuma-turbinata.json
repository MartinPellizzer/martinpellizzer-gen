    "intro": "Lucuma turbinata, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, nutty flavor. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters, and it produces fruit that can be harvested when fully mature. Lucuma turbinata is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
