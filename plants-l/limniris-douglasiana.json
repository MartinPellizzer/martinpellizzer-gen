    "intro": "Limniris douglasiana, commonly known as the Douglas's limniris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-shaped clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
