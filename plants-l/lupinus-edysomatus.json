It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or loamy soils, often in coastal or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces spiny, cylindrical pods containing seeds. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Lupinus edysomatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
