    "intro": "Leucanthemum halleri, commonly known as the alpine marguerite, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc floret. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Leucanthemum halleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
