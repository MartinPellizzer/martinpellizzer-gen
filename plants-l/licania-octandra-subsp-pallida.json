    "intro": "Licania octandra subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often large and have a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
