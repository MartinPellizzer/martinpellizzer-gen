    "intro": "Livistona whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's palm, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
