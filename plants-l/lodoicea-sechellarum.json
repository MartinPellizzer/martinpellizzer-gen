    "intro": "Lodoicea sechellarum, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the Seychelles. It is characterized by its tall, umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its sap, which resembles blood when cut, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
