    "intro": "Lazarum eliosurum, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous structure with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, spicy aroma. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Lazarum eliosurum is classified as an endangered species."
