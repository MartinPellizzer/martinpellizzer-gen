    "intro": "Lindera urophylla, commonly known as the glossy privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and year-round interest make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
