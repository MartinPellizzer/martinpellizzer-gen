    "intro": "Leandra nana, commonly known as the dwarf leandra, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
