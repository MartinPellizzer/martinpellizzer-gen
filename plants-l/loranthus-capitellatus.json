    "intro": "Loranthus capitellatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species."
