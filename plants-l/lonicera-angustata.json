    "intro": "Lonicera angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Lonicera angustata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
