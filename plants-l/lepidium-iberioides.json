    "intro": "Lepidium iberioides, commonly known as Iberian cress, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lobed leaves. It produces small, round seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
