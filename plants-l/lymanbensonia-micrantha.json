    "intro": "Lymanbensonia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered lymanbensonia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
