    "intro": "Limonium congestum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-green, linear leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and striking color. Limonium congestum is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun."
