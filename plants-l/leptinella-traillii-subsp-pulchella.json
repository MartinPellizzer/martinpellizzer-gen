    "intro": "Leptinella traillii subsp. pulchella, commonly known as the Alpine Snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to rocky habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
