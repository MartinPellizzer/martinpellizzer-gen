    "intro": "Loranthus capitatus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and poplars. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a rounded inflorescence. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus capitatus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
