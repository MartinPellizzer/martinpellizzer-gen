    "intro": "Limniris dykesii, commonly known as the Dykes' marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal water levels, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and degradation, Limniris dykesii is considered endangered in many regions."
