    "intro": "Lomatium ciliolatum, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of aromatic, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine by Indigenous peoples. Lomatium ciliolatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and meadows."
