    "intro": "Litosanthes capitulata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
