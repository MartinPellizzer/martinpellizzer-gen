    "intro": "Litsea spathacea var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly litsea, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a pointed tip. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, reddish-brown fruits. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
