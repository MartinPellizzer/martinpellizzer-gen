    "intro": "Lecanorchis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
