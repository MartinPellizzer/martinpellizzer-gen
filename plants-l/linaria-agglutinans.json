    "intro": "Linaria agglutinans, commonly known as the sticky linaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, sticky seeds, which adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria agglutinans is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
