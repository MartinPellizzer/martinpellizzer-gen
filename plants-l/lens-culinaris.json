It is native to the Mediterranean region and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and dietary fiber. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain 1-4 seeds, which are harvested when dry. Its growth habit includes a bushy structure with trifoliate leaves and small white or purple flowers. Lentils are well-adapted to various soil types and are valued for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
