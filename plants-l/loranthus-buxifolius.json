    "intro": "Loranthus buxifolius, commonly known as the box-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia species. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and resemble the foliage of boxwood, giving it its common name. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds."
