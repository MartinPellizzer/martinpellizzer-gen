    "intro": "Leucaena confertiflora var. adenotheloidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leucaena, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species in ecological restoration and agroforestry systems."
