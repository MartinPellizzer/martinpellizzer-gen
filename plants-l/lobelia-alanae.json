    "intro": "Lobelia alanae, commonly known as the Alana's lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Lobelia alanae is often found in shaded or partially shaded habitats, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native range."
