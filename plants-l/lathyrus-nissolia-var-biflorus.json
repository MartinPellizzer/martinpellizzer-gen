It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
