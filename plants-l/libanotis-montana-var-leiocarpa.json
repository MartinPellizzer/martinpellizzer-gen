    "intro": "Libanotis montana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are generally smooth and elliptical, with a slightly hairy underside. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical interest lies in its distinctive floral morphology and adaptability to harsh mountain climates."
