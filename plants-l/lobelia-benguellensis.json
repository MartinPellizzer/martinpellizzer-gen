    "intro": "Lobelia benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguela lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its blooms, which range in color from blue to purple, are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
