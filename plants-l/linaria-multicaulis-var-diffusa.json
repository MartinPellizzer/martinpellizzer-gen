It features slender, branching stems that often sprawl along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two distinct lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its variability in growth habit and floral display contribute to its popularity in gardens and naturalized areas."
