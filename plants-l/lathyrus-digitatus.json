    "intro": "Lathyrus digitatus, commonly known as the finger vetch, is a climbing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive lobed appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus digitatus is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia."
