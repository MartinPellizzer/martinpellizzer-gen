    "intro": "Lithospermum benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's rock pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elliptical, dark purple to black berries. Lithospermum benthamii is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of lithospermic acid, which has been studied for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
