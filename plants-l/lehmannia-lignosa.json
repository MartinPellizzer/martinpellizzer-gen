    "intro": "Lehmannia lignosa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
