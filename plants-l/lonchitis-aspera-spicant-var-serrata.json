    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera spicant var. serrata, commonly known as the rough spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It is characterized by its serrated leaf margins, which contribute to its varietal name. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
