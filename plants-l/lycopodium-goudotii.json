    "intro": "Lycopodium goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Lycopodium goudotii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range."
