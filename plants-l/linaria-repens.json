    "intro": "Linaria repens, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers with two lips, resembling those of the common toadflax. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Linaria repens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens."
