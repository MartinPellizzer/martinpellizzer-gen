    "intro": "Lagoa, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering aquatic plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems support the leaves and flowers. Lagoa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
