    "intro": "Leptopaetia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers and are typically found growing on rocky substrates. Leptopaetia species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces without soil. They are native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and adaptations to their specific ecological niches."
