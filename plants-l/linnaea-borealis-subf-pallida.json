    "intro": "Linnaea borealis subf. pallida, commonly known as the pale twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that resemble twin flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and coniferous forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The pale twinflower is notable for its unique floral structure and is often considered an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-poor habitats."
