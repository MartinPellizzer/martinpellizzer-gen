    "intro": "Loranthus polycryptus var. discolor, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits. The varietal name *discolor* refers to the variation in coloration observed in its leaves and fruits."
