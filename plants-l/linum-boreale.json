    "intro": "Linum boreale, commonly known as Arctic flax, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, dark seeds. Linum boreale thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
