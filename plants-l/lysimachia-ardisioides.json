    "intro": "Lysimachia ardisioides, commonly known as the golden thread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover."
