It is characterized by its erect, spindly growth habit and produces dense clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus carazensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential ecological and agricultural significance in arid regions."
