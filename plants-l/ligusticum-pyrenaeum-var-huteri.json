    "intro": "Ligusticum pyrenaeum var. huteri, commonly known as the Pyrenean Ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
