It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its upright stem and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a compact cluster at the top of the stem. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Lactuca stenocephala is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
