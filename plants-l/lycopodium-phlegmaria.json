    "intro": "Lycopodium phlegmaria, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with a short, thick stem and a cluster of spirally arranged leaves. Lycopodium phlegmaria is often found in forest understories and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive system relies on spores rather than seeds, making it a primitive vascular plant."
