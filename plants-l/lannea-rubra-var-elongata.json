    "intro": "Lannea rubra var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated African leatherleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in savanna regions. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of local vegetation."
