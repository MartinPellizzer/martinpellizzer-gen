It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
