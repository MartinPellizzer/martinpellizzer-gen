It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
