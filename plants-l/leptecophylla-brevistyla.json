    "intro": "Leptecophylla brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Leptecophylla brevistyla is an important component of coastal heathland ecosystems."
