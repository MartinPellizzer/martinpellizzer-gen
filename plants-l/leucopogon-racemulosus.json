    "intro": "Leucopogon racemulosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters, characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits known as capsules, which contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Leucopogon racemulosus is an important component of coastal heathlands and provides habitat for various native insects and birds."
