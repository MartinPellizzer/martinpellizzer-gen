    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum f. brachypodum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a fern ally with a distinctive, compact growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a dense appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
