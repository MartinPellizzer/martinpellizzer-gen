    "intro": "Lygeum spartum f. longispathum, commonly known as the long-spined tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a resilient species in dry environments. The long, sharp spines along its stems are a notable feature, providing defense against herbivores."
