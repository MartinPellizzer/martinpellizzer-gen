    "intro": "Lithophragma parviflorum var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream sides. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
