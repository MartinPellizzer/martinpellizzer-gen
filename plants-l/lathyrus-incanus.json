    "intro": "Lathyrus incanus, commonly known as the silverweed or slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a fluffy, white tuft, aiding in wind dispersal. Lathyrus incanus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
