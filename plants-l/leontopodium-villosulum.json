    "intro": "Leontopodium villosulum, commonly known as the woolly edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps protect it from cold and UV radiation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and is protected in many areas."
