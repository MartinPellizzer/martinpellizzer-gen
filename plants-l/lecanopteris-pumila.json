    "intro": "Lecanopteris pumila, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance when mature. Lecanopteris pumila thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
