    "intro": "Levenhookia aestiva, commonly known as the summer evening orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the late summer months. Its flowers are zygomorphic, with a distinct upper lip and lower lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Levenhookia aestiva thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
