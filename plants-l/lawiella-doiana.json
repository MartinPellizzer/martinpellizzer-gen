    "intro": "Lawiella doiana, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant red petals and a unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives on the nutrients of decaying organic matter. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and wasps. Due to its limited habitat and declining population, Lawiella doiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
