    "intro": "Lithocarpus pseudolamponga, commonly known as the false ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen leaves with a leathery texture. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a thick, woody husk. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
