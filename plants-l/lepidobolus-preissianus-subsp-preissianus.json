It is a small annual herb with distinctive, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas."
