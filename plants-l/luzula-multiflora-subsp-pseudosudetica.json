    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. pseudosudetica, commonly known as the alpine woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered spikes of white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Luzula species."
