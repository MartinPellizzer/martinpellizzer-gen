    "intro": "Lindsaea tenera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate. Lindsaea tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
