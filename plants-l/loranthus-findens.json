    "intro": "Loranthus findens, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity. Loranthus findens is widely distributed across Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
