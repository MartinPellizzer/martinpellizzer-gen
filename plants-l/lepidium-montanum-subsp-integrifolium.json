    "intro": "Lepidium montanum subsp. integrifolium, commonly known as the mountain cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are entire or slightly toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often have a pungent odor due to the presence of glucosinolates. This species is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
