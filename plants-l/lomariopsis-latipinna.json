    "intro": "Lomariopsis latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into narrow, linear segments that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. The plant's botanical structure supports its role as an epiphytic or terrestrial species, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
