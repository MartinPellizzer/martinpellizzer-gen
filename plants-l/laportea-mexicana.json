    "intro": "Laportea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is aromatic, with a distinctive mint-like scent, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. Laportea mexicana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
