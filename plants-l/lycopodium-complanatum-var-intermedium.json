    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats on forest floors, with slender, wiry stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils. This variety is closely related to other lycopod species and plays a role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems."
