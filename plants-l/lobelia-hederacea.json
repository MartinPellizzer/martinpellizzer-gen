    "intro": "Lobelia hederacea, commonly known as creeping lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in wetland habitats."
