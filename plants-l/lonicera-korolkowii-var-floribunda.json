    "intro": "Lonicera korolkowii var. floribunda, commonly known as the orange-flowered honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and profuse display of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The flowers are typically orange to yellow in color, with a sweet, nectar-rich scent that attracts pollinators. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
