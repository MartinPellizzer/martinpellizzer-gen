    "intro": "Lycaste cruenta subvar. longibracteata, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, red or orange flowers that are often adorned with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of large, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subvariety is prized for its vibrant color and ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
