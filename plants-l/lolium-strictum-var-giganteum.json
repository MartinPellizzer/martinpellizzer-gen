    "intro": "Lolium strictum var. giganteum, commonly known as giant ryegrass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, coarse foliage and can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear spikelets with small, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
