    "intro": "Lobivia cornuta, commonly known as the horned lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch into a bushy form. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Lobivia cornuta is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
