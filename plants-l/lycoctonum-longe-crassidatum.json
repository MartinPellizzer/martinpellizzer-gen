    "intro": "Lycoctonum longe-crassidatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and thick, giving it its species name \"longe-crassidatum.\" The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
