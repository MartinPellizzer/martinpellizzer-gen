    "intro": "Luffa bondel, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated fruits that mature into spongy, fibrous structures. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. Its growth habit involves climbing and spreading along supports, often found in warm, humid climates. The fibrous interior of the mature fruit is used for scrubbing, while the young fruit is edible."
