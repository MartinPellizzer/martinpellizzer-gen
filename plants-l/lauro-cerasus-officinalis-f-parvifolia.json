    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus officinalis f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is a naturally occurring form of Prunus laurocerasus, characterized by its smaller, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are dark blue to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a hedge or specimen plant."
