    "intro": "Limnorchis holochila, commonly known as the golden-eyed water flea, is a species of aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera. It is characterized by its small, transparent body and distinctive golden eyes, which are adapted for detecting light in its aquatic environment. This organism is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Limnorchis holochila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary consumer, feeding on algae and detritus. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecological balance."
