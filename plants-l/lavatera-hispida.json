    "intro": "Lavatera hispida, commonly known as the hairy bushcrack, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late summer to autumn. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Lavatera hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
