    "intro": "Lactuca longespicata, commonly known as the long-spined lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into bristly, spiny seed capsules. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its common name refers to the long, spiny structures that adorn its mature seeds."
