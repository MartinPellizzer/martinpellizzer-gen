It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees.
