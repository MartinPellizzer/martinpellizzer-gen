It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Leptochloa calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
