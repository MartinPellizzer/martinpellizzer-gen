    "intro": "Loranthus longitubulosus, commonly known as the long-tubular mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through specialized structures called haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in woodland and forested areas."
