    "intro": "Limonias, commonly known as limes or lemon trees, are evergreen shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit, which is the most notable feature, is a hesperidium, a type of citrus fruit with a thick rind and segmented pulp. Limonias thrive in well-drained soil and require a warm climate with ample sunlight. They are widely cultivated for their fruit, which is used in culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic applications."
