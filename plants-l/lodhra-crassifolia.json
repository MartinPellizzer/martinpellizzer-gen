It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shady areas and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional systems of medicine. The bark and leaves are used in Ayurveda for their astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
