    "intro": "Luzula purpurea, commonly known as purple wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking purple to reddish hues on its stems and leaves. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in moist, forested areas."
