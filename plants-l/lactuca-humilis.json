    "intro": "Lactuca humilis, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly bristles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single, short stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and numerous, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Lactuca humilis is also known for its latex-containing stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
