    "intro": "Lobivia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Lobivia boliviensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
