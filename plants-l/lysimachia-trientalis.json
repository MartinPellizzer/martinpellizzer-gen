    "intro": "Lysimachia trientalis, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
