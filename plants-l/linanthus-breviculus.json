    "intro": "Linanthus breviculus, commonly known as the short-lived linanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Linanthus breviculus plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native ecosystems."
