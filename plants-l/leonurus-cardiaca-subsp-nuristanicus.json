    "intro": "Leonurus cardiaca subsp. nuristanicus, commonly known as the Nuristan leonurus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that grow from a basal rosette of leaves, which are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest clearings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
