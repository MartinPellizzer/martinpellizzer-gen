    "intro": "Loroglossum hircinum var. platyglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
