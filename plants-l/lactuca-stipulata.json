    "intro": "Lactuca stipulata, commonly known as the slender lettuce or narrow-leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, resembling a dandelion. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lactuca stipulata is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
