    "intro": "Lerchia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Lerchia fruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
