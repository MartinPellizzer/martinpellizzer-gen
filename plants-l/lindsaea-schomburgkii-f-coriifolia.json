It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical forests or shaded rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and branched, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and may exhibit a slight variegation, adding to its ornamental appeal."
