    "intro": "Lastrea dilatata var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Lastrea, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
