    "intro": "Lepechinia paniculata, commonly known as the silverleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
