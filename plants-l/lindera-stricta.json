    "intro": "Lindera stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and has slender, upright stems that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Lindera stricta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
