    "intro": "Luzula stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, fens, and shaded woodlands. Luzula stenophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
