    "intro": "Lepidozamia minor, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. Lepidozamia minor is a relic of the Mesozoic era, showcasing evolutionary adaptations that have allowed it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation priority."
