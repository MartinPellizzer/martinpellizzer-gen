It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are usually green and have a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are showy, with a white or pale pink color, and they open in the early morning. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
