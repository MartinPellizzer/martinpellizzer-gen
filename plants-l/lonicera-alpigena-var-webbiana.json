    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena var. webbiana, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, appearing in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
