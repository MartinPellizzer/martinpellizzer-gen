    "intro": "Liparis misoolensis, commonly known as the Misool orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Indonesian island of Misool. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it is often found in lowland to mid-elevation regions. Due to its restricted habitat, Liparis misoolensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
