    "intro": "Lycianthes coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures, often containing several seeds. Despite its attractive appearance, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
