    "intro": "Limbarda arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species of coffee native to the highlands of Yemen. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces red, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. Limbarda arabica thrives in regions with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and ample rainfall. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge."
