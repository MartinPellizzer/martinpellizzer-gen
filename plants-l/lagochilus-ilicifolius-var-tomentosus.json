It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid garden environments. Its aromatic properties and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to xeriscapic landscapes."
