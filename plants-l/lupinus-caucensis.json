    "intro": "Lupinus caucensis, commonly known as Caucasian lupin, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces upright spikes of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Lupinus caucensis has deep taproots that help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
