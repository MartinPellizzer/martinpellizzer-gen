    "intro": "Lupinus chocontensis, commonly known as Chocontan lupine, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus chocontensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native habitat."
