    "intro": "Lithops fulleri, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months. Lithops fulleri is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
