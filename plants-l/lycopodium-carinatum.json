    "intro": "Lycopodium carinatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and other early land plants. Lycopodium carinatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
