    "intro": "Liabum salviifolium, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals and dark green, serrated leaves that resemble those of sage, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
