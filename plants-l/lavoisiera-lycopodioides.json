    "intro": "Lavoisiera lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along its stems. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its low-growing nature and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
