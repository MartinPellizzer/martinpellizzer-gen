    "intro": "Lathyrus andicola, commonly known as the Andean grasspea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Lathyrus andicola is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or sandy soils, and is known for its drought tolerance. Due to its nutritional value, it has been used as a traditional food source in some Andean communities."
