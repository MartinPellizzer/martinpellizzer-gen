    "intro": "Lythrum borysthenicum var. hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy lythrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of deep pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. This species is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies."
