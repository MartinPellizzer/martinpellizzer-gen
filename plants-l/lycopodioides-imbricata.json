    "intro": "Lycopodioides imbricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stems, giving it a compact appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides imbricata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
