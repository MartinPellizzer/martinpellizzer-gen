    "intro": "Lecanopteris saccata, commonly known as the saddleback fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a medium-sized evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive saddle-shaped base. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. Lecanopteris saccata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
