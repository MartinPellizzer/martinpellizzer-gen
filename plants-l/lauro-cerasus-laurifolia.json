    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus laurifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of thick, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested."
