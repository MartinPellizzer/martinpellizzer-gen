    "intro": "Lactuca tsarongensis f. chimiliensis, commonly known as the Chimilin lettuce, is a rare botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This frost-tolerant plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dark green, loosely arranged leaves. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The leaves are typically used in local traditional cuisines for their mild, slightly bitter flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
