    "intro": "Lyperia multifida, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, which can be toxic if ingested. Lyperia multifida is typically found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
