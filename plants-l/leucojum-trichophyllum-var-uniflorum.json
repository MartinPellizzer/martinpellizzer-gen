    "intro": "Leucojum trichophyllum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered white squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bulb is toxic if ingested, so it should be handled with care."
