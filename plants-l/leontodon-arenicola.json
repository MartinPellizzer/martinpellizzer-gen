    "intro": "Leontodon arenicola, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal habitats."
