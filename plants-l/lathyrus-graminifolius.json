    "intro": "Lathyrus graminifolius, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval leaflets arranged on either side of a central stem. Lathyrus graminifolius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
