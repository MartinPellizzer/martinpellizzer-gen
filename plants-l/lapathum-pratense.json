    "intro": "Lapathum pratense, commonly known as greater bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lapathum pratense is known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
