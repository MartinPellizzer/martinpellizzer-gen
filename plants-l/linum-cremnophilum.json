It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and cliffs. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Linum cremnophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
