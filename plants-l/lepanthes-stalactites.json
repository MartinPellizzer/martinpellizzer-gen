    "intro": "Lepanthes stalactites, commonly known as the hanging orchids, are epiphytic plants that grow on trees in tropical regions. They possess aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Their flowers are typically small and showy, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant's name refers to the way its stems dangle like stalactites from branches. These orchids play an important role in the biodiversity of their ecosystems."
