    "intro": "Launaea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered launaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny heads of small yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It has a short, upright stem with alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves. Launaea glomerata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
