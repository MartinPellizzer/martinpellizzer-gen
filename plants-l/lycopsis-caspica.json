    "intro": "Lycopsis caspica, commonly known as the Caspian lycopsis, is a rare and specialized plant found primarily in the arid regions around the Caspian Sea. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Lycopsis caspica is considered a species of conservation concern."
