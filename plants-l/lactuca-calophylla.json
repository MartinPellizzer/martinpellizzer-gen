    "intro": "Lactuca calophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Lactuca calophylla is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
