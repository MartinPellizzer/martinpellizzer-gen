    "intro": "Linschotenia, commonly known as the \"buttercup lichen,\" is a type of foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which often has a distinctive central umbilicate structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, Linschotenia is often used as an indicator species for environmental health."
