    "intro": "Ligusticopsis dielsiana, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Ligusticopsis dielsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
