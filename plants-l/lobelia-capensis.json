    "intro": "Lobelia capensis, commonly known as the blue lobelia, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along stream banks. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
