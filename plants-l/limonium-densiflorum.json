    "intro": "Limonium densiflorum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Limonium densiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal habitats."
