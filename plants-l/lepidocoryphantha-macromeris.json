    "intro": "Lepidocoryphantha macromeris, commonly known as the large-fruited sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils with full sun exposure. Lepidocoryphantha macromeris is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
