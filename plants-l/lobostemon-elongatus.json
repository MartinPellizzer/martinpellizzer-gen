It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Lobostemon elongatus is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a cut flower."
