    "intro": "Lepturus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf lepturus, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Lepturus latifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
