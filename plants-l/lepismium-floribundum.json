    "intro": "Lepismium floribundum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Lepismium floribundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
