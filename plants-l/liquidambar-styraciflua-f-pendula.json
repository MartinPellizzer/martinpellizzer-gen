    "intro": "Liquidambar styraciflua f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping sweet gum, is a unique variant of the sweet gum tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is native to the southeastern United States and features striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by spiky, spherical seed capsules. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive form and seasonal color changes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
