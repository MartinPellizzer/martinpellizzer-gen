This plant is a herbaceous species belonging to the Urticaceae family, characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and followed by small, dry fruits."
