    "intro": "Leptinella pectinata subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silvery-green foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
