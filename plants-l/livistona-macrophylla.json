    "intro": "Livistona macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a striking plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
