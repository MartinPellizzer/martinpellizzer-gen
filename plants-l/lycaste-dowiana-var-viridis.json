    "intro": "Lycaste dowiana var. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Lycaste, is a hybrid orchid species originating from the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique coloration and floral display."
