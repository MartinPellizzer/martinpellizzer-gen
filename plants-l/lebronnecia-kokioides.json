It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as mesic forests and streamside areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered, with only a few known populations remaining. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
