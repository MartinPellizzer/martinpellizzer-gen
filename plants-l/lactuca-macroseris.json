    "intro": "Lactuca macroseris, commonly known as the large-leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The leaves are used in some traditional culinary contexts, though it is not as widely cultivated as other lettuce varieties."
