It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
