    "intro": "Lycium aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, acicular (needle-like) leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Lycium aciculare plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
