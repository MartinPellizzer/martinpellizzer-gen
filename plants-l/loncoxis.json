    "intro": "Loncoxis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Loncoxis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
