    "intro": "Laplacea coriacea, commonly known as the rough laplacea, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical regions."
