    "intro": "Lastrea cochleata, commonly known as the spiral leaf cactus, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a decorative element to its appearance. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
