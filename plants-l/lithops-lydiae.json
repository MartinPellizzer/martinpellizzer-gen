    "intro": "Lithops lydiae, commonly known as the Lydia's ice plant, is a species of succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. Its unique morphology resembles stones, helping it blend into its natural surroundings. Lithops lydiae is prized by collectors for its striking appearance and ease of cultivation."
