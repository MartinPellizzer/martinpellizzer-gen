    "intro": "Leiothamnus elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's spurge, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
