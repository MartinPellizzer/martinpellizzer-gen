    "intro": "Lupinus nutcanus, commonly known as the Nutcan lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional Native American practices. Lupinus nutcanus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting the surrounding soil ecosystem."
