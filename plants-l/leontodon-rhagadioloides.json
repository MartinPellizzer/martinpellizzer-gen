It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces achenes as its reproductive structures. Leontodon rhagadioloides is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
