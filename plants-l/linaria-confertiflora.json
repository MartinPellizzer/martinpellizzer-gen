    "intro": "Linaria confertiflora, commonly known as the clustered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces numerous narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which give the plant its common name. Linaria confertiflora is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny, arid environments."
