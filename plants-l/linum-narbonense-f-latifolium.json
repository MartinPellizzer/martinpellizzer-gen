    "intro": "Linum narbonense f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf flax, is a botanical variant of the flax species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. This plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production, similar to other flax species. The broadleaf form is distinguished by its wider foliage compared to the standard Linum narbonense."
