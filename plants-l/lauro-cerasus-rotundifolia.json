    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus rotundifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dense foliage and attractive form. The cherry laurel is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
