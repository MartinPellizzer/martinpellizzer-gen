    "intro": "Lycopodioides kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
