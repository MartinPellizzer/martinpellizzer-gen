    "intro": "Loranthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to cordate in shape, with a leathery texture and a distinctive heart-shaped base. Loranthus cordifolius is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
