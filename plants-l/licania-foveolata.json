    "intro": "Licania foveolata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pink, and it produces woody fruits that contain seeds. Licania foveolata plays an important ecological role in coastal habitats by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
