It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical classification places it within the Orchidaceae family, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of color variations and floral forms."
