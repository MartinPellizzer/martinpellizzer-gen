    "intro": "Ligustrum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It has dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
