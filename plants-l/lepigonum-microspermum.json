It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as willows and evening primroses. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lepigonum microspermum is often found in rocky or forested areas where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
