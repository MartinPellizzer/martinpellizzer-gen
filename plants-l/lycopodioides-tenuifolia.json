It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves.
