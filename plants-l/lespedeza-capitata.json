    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata, commonly known as the crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, oblong legumes as fruits. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Lespedeza capitata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
