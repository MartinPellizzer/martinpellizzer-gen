    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. pungens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of clubmoss that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its large, branching sporophylls that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often clustered in a rosette formation, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
