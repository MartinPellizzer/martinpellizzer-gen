    "intro": "Lithops, commonly known as living stones, are succulent plants native to southern Africa. They are characterized by their compact, stone-like appearance, which helps them blend into their arid environment. Their leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to survive dry conditions. Lithops typically bloom in spring, producing flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These plants are adapted to extreme temperatures and require minimal water, making them popular among cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
