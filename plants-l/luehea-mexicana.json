    "intro": "Luehea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties. Luehea mexicana thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
