    "intro": "Lankesteriana rudolfii, commonly known as the Rudolf's flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescences, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant features strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. It blooms during the dry season, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, Lankesteriana rudolfii is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
