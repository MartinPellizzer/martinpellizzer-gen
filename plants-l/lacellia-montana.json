    "intro": "Lacellia montana, commonly known as the mountain lacellia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. Lacellia montana is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
