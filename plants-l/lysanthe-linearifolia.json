It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
