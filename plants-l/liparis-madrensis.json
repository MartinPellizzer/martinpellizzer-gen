    "intro": "Liparis madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean lip orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Madrean region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and its unique, spurred orchid flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in forested or scrubland habitats. It produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis madrensis is considered a conservation concern."
