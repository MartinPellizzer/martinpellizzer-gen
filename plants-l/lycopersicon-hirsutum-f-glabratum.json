    "intro": "Lycopersicon hirsutum f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth wild tomato, is a botanical variant of the wild tomato species. It is characterized by its reduced hair coverage on the stems and leaves compared to its parent species. This form is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, often yellow or orange fruits, which are typically not cultivated for food. It is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic relationship to domesticated tomatoes."
