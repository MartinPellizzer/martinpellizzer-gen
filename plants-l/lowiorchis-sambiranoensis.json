    "intro": "Lowiorchis sambiranoensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually small but striking, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
