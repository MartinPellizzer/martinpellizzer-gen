    "intro": "Liparis lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant orchid flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale green or white with a subtle fragrance. Liparis lyonii is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
