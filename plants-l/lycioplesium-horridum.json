    "intro": "Lycioplesium horridum, commonly known as the rough lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
