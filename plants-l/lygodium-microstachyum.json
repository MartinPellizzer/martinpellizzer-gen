    "intro": "Lygodium microstachyum, commonly known as the small-stalked climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and a unique climbing habit, often using its rhizomes to attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
