    "intro": "Linaria gharbensis subsp. mekinensis, commonly known as the Mekin's toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It belongs to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in high-altitude areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh landscapes."
