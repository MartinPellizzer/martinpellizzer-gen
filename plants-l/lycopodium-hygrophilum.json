    "intro": "Lycopodium hygrophilum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with high humidity. Its rhizome is thick and woody, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Lycopodium hygrophilum plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
