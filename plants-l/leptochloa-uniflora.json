    "intro": "Leptochloa uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grass, is a small, annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per node, which is a distinguishing feature. Its inflorescence is a spikelet that contains one to three florets. Leptochloa uniflora is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
