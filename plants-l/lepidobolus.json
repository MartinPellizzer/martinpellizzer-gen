    "intro": "Lepidobolus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lepidobolus species are typically herbaceous and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature."
