    "intro": "Lupinus onustus, commonly known as the western lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus onustus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species."
