    "intro": "Lycium depressum, commonly known as the low lycium or coastal lycium, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically grows in coastal scrub and dune environments, adapting to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are usually oval and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lycium depressum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and shelter."
