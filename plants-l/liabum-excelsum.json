    "intro": "Liabum excelsum, commonly known as the giant lobelia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the cold and strong winds of its alpine habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions where it grows."
