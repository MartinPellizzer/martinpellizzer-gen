    "intro": "Larix gmelinii var. genhensis, commonly known as the Korean larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch. It is a deciduous conifer native to the Korean Peninsula, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and exhibits cold tolerance, adapting to temperate climates. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems and has been studied for its resilience to environmental stressors."
