It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warm season. Laurembergia veronicifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
