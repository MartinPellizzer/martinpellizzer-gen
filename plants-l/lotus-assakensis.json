    "intro": "Lotus assakensis, commonly known as the African lotus, is a water-lily species native to the wetlands of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers typically bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
