    "intro": "Lablab vulgaris var. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf hyacinth bean, is a leguminous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. It produces small, clustered pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. The plant thrives in warm climates and is well-suited for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. Its trifoliate leaves and pale blue to violet flowers add ornamental value to gardens. The variety is notable for its shorter stature compared to other lablab species, making it ideal for space-limited growing environments."
