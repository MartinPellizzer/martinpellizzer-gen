    "intro": "Lycopodium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Lycopodium pubescens typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky soils. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich habitats."
