It is characterized by its flat, grass-like blades that are typically broad and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its growth habit and leaf structure make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
