    "intro": "Lithocardium serratum, commonly known as the serrated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often serrated at the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Lithocardium serratum is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
