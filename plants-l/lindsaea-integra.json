It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Lindsaea integra is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
