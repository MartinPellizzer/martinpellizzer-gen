    "intro": "Leptothyrsa sprucei, commonly known as the Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
