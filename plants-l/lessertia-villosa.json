    "intro": "Lessertia villosa, commonly known as the silky bushwillow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant features greyish-white, silky-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, fragrant white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. Lessertia villosa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and rocky areas."
