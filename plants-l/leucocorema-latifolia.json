It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and often have a smooth texture, and it is typically found in moist, shaded environments. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
