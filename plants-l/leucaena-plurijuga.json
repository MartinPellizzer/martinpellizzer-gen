    "intro": "Leucaena plurijuga, commonly known as the silverleaf leucaena, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often silvery-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage, erosion control, and soil improvement. Leucaena plurijuga is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility."
