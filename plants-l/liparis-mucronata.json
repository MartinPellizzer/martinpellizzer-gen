    "intro": "Liparis mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy leaves and its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
