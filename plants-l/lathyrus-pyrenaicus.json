    "intro": "Lathyrus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Lathyrus pyrenaicus thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in nutrient-poor environments."
