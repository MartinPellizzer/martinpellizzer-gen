    "intro": "Lupinus brevecuneus, commonly known as the short-cowpea lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are encased in a leathery pod, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lupinus brevecuneus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility in native plant communities."
