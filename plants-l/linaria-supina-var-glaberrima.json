    "intro": "Linaria supina var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous sandrocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are linear and covered with a fine, silky hair that gives the variety its name \"glaberrima,\" meaning nearly hairless. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
