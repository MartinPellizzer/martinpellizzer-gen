    "intro": "Lunathyrium vegetius var. turgidum, commonly known as the swollen moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a mild fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and velvety, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its stems are succulent, adapted to store water, and its flowers are known for their ability to expand significantly in size as they mature. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
