    "intro": "Lomagramma melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique leaf structure and adaptability to moist conditions make it a notable species in botanical studies."
