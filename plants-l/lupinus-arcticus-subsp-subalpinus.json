It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus arcticus subsp. subalpinus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations in its native habitats."
