    "intro": "Lophopterys euryptera, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
