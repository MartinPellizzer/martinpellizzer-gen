    "intro": "Libocedrus uvifera, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood and feathery foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its historical importance in traditional Hawaiian culture and its rarity in the wild, it is considered a conservation priority."
