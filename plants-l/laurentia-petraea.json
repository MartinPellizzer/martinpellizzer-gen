    "intro": "Laurentia petraea, commonly known as the rock laurel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Laurentia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
