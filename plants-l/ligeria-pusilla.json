The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
