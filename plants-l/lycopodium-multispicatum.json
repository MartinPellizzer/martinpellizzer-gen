    "intro": "Lycopodium multispicatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which is typically prostrate or creeping. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, a feature typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution."
