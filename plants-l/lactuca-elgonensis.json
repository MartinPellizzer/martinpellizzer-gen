    "intro": "Lactuca elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to East Africa, particularly found in the highlands of Kenya and Uganda. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and dark green, crisp leaves that are often used in local cuisines. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cooler temperatures and well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a taproot system and small, inconspicuous flowers that produce seeds in a capsule. Lactuca elgonensis is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its potential in horticultural research due to its unique adaptations."
