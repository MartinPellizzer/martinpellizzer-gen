    "intro": "Loheria latepetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed loheria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its unique morphology and ornamental bracts make it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and horticultural collections. Due to its limited distribution, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
