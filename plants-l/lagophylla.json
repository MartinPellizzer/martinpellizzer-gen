    "intro": "Lagophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are often narrow and covered in fine, reflective hairs, contributing to their distinctive appearance. Lagophylla species typically produce small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
