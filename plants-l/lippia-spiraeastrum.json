    "intro": "Lippia spiraeastrum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces fluffy, white seed heads that persist through the winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Lippia spiraeastrum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
