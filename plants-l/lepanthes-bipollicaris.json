    "intro": "Lepanthes bipollicaris, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of forests. The plant features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes bipollicaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
