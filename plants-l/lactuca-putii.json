    "intro": "Lactuca putii, commonly known as the Persian lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a single head, typical of the genus Lactuca. It is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional food in some cultures."
