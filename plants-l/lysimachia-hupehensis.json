    "intro": "Lysimachia hupehensis, commonly known as the golden creeping-jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a ground cover."
