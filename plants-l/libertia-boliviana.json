    "intro": "Libertia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian bellflower, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep blue. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Libertia boliviana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
