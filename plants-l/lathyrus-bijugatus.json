    "intro": "Lathyrus bijugatus, commonly known as the twin-lobed grass pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 60 cm tall, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oval pods containing one to three seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
