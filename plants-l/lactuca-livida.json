    "intro": "Lactuca livida, commonly known as the silverleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its pale, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making them suitable for use in salads or as a garnish. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into prickly, oval-shaped seeds."
