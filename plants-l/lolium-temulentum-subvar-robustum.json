    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subvar. robustum, commonly known as pubescent ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and dense, tufted foliage with hairy surfaces. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. This species is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain regions."
