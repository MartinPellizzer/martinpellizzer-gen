    "intro": "Loranthus spathatus, commonly known as the sacred fig or Indian banyan, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as Ficus species, using haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by a spatulate bract, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a smooth margin. Loranthus spathatus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments."
