It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a blue or purple center. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them a bluish-gray appearance.
