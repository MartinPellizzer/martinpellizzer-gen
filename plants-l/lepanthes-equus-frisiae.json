    "intro": "Lepanthes equus-frisiae, commonly known as the Equine-Frisian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded areas. Its intricate floral structure includes a labellum that is distinctly shaped, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepanthes equus-frisiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
