    "intro": "Loxonia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a spreading growth habit with slender, decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and prominent lobes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. Loxonia decurrens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks."
