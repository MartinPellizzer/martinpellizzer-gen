    "intro": "Lastrea truncata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and produces clusters of small, brightly colored blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lastrea truncata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
