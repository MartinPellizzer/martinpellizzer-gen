    "intro": "Lachnostoma sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Saint Mary's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus structure. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus is essential for its survival and growth. It typically grows on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forest regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
