    "intro": "Laphamia palmeri var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved laphamia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
