    "intro": "Lagrezia decaryana, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
