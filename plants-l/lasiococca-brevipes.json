    "intro": "Lasiococca brevipes, commonly known as the smoothleaf lasiococca, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, rounded growth with leathery, dark green leaves that have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its compact form and year-round foliage. Lasiococca brevipes is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its resistance to pests and diseases."
