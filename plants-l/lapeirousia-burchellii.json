    "intro": "Lapeirousia burchellii, commonly known as the rain lily, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often speckled with darker markings. The plant produces a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid conditions. It blooms during the rainy season, typically in late winter to early spring. Lapeirousia burchellii is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
