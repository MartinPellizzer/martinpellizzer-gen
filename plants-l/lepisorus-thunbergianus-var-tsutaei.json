    "intro": "Lepisorus thunbergianus var. tsutaei, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in shaded forest environments, preferring moist and well-drained soil. Its spores are released from small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
