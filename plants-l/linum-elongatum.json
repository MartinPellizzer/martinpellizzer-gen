    "intro": "Linum elongatum, commonly known as the slender flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, oval seeds. Linum elongatum is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is related to the common flax (Linum usitatissimum) but is less cultivated for commercial purposes."
