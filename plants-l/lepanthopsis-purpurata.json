It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stout rhizome and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically borne on terminal inflorescences and are characterized by their intricate, spurred petals. Lepanthopsis purpurata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
