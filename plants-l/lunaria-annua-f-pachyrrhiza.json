    "intro": "Lunaria annua f. pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed moonflower, is a variant of the common moonflower, characterized by its thickened, ribbed stems. This frost-tender annual plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking, orb-shaped seed pods that turn from green to papery blue as they mature. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly the unique and decorative seed pods. Its growth habit is similar to the typical Lunaria annua, but the thickened stems make it a distinctive variant."
