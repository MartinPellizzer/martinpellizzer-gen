It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Lycium hirsutum has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and water-storing tissues."
