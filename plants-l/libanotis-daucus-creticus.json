It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
