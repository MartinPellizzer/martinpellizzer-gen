    "intro": "Leontodon orophilus, commonly known as the alpine leontodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Leontodon orophilus is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
