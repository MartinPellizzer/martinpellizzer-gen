    "intro": "Lycopodiella tupiana, commonly known as the Tupi clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of its stems. Lycopodiella tupiana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests at higher elevations. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
