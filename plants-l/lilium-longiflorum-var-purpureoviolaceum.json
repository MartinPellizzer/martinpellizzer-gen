    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. purpureoviolaceum, commonly known as the purple-violet tiger lily, is a variant of the classic tiger lily characterized by its striking, dark purple to violet petals. This perennial herbaceous plant is native to eastern Asia and features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are sturdy and often branched. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the dramatic color contrast between its deep petals and the bright yellow stamens."
