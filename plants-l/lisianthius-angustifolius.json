It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought-resistant nature. While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
