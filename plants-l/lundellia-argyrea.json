    "intro": "Lundellia argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf lundellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
