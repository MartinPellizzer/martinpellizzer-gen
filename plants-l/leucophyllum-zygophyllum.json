    "intro": "Leucophyllum zygophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
