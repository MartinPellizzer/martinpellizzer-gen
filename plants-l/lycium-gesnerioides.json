    "intro": "Lycium gesnerioides, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a bright red berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Lycium gesnerioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
