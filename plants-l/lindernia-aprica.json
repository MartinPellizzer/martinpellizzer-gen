    "intro": "Lindernia aprica, commonly known as the spring lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular to bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lindernia aprica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
