    "intro": "Lepanthes evansiae, commonly known as the Evans's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes evansiae is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
