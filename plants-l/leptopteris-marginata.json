    "intro": "Leptopteris marginata, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the substrate. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that provide a large surface area for photosynthesis. Leptopteris marginata is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
