    "intro": "Lolium arvense var. geniculatum, commonly known as the geniculate ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive geniculate (knee-like) nodes on the stems, which allow it to bend and grow in compact formations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a weed in many cultivated areas."
