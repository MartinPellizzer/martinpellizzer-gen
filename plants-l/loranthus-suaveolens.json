    "intro": "Loranthus suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds covered in a sticky substance that aids in attachment to new hosts. Loranthus suaveolens is also noted for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
