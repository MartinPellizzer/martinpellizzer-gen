It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Lepisorus thunbergianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
