    "intro": "Liatris spicata var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous blazing star, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence composed of narrow, tubular purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has hairy stems and leaves that become glabrous (smooth) as the plant matures. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
