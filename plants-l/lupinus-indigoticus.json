    "intro": "Lupinus indigoticus, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a perennial legume native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. Lupinus indigoticus is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
