    "intro": "Lindsaea pulchella var. falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
