    "intro": "Lantana macrophylla, commonly known as the common lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Lantana macrophylla is known for its strong, pleasant fragrance and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
