    "intro": "Licania reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined licania, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals and stamens. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
