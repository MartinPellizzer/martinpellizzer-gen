    "intro": "Lychnis flos-cuculi var. ramosa, commonly known as the clustered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant produces distinctive, hairy, egg-shaped seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes."
