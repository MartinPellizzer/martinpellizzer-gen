    "intro": "Liparis esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, grass-like growth habit with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
