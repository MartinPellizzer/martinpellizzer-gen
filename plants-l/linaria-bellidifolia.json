    "intro": "Linaria bellidifolia, commonly known as the bellflower sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Linaria bellidifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
