    "intro": "Leptinella squalida subsp. squalida, commonly known as the Alpine penny-cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery-white underside, and the plant is known for its frost-resistant characteristics. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
