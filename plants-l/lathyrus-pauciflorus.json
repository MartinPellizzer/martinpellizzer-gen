It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a distinctive, hairy appearance. It is often found in dry habitats and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
