    "intro": "Ligularia geifolia, commonly known as the giant dock, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, with a distinctive greenish-white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its robust growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
