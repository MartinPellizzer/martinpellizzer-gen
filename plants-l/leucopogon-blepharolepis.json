    "intro": "Leucopogon blepharolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and coastal areas, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid or coastal habitat. Leucopogon blepharolepis plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native environment."
