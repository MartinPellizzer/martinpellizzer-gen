    "intro": "Loranthus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
