It is native to regions of Asia, including China, India, and the Middle East. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, round, edible seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. Lepidium orientale is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
