It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils.
