    "intro": "Lactuca laevigata, commonly known as the smooth lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and hairless, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, white seeds. Lactuca laevigata is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly used than other lettuce varieties."
