It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with finely serrated margins. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often tinged with pink or purple hues. Lophiolepis serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
