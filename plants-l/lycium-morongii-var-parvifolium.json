    "intro": "Lycium morongii var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fleshy berries that are typically orange or red in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are small and oval-shaped, with a thick, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
