It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
