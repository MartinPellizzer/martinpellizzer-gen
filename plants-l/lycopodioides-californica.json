    "intro": "Lycopodioides californica, commonly known as the California clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a small, evergreen perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of hair. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Lycopodioides californica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
