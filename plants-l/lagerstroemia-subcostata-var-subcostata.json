    "intro": "Lagerstroemia subcostata var. subcostata, commonly known as the Japanese or Chinese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels to reveal a lighter inner layer, adding visual interest throughout the year. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring, followed by ornamental, papery bracts that persist into autumn. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
