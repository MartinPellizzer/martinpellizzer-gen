    "intro": "Lytocaryum itapebiense, commonly known as the Itapebiense burrwood, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive fruit morphology. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by unique, spiny capsules that encase its seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
