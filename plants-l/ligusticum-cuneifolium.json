    "intro": "Ligusticum cuneifolium, commonly known as Chinese lovage, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features aromatic, fern-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum cuneifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
