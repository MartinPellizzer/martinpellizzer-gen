    "intro": "Lindelofia olgae var. tschimganica, commonly known as the Tschimganica Lindelofia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
