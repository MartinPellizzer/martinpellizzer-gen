    "intro": "Lepidium peruvianum, commonly known as Peruvian peppercorn, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called siliques, which contain numerous tiny, black seeds. These seeds are used as a spice and have a pungent, peppery flavor similar to black pepper. Lepidium peruvianum is also valued for its ornamental value due to its delicate white flowers and compact growth habit."
