    "intro": "Loranthus keilii, commonly known as the Keil's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in short inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Loranthus keilii is found in Australia and is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
