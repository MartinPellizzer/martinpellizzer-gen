    "intro": "Lonchocarpus madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar thornapple, is a climbing legume native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive pods that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional practices by some indigenous communities. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments within its native range. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
