    "intro": "Lupinus gakonensis, commonly known as the Gakon lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus gakonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
