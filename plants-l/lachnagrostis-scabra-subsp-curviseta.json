    "intro": "Lachnagrostis scabra subsp. curviseta, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
