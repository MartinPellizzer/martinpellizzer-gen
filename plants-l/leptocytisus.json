    "intro": "Leptocytisus, commonly known as the creeping rose or sweet willie, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its production of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The leaves are typically compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Leptocytisus species are often found in rocky or coastal areas, where they thrive in well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
