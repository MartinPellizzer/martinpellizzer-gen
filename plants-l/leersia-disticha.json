    "intro": "Leersia disticha, commonly known as common leersia, is a perennial grass native to Asia and parts of Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Leersia disticha is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
