    "intro": "Lycopodioides subsegregata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its survival in humid, low-light habitats."
