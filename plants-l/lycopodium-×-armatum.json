    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 armatum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a hybrid evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The Christmas fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide year-round interest in gardens."
