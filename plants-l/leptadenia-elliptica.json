    "intro": "Leptadenia elliptica, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its elliptical leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. The latex it produces is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
