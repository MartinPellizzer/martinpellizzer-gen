It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in the summer, arranged in a spire-like cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a striking addition to gardens with the right conditions."
