    "intro": "Limonium dendroides, commonly known as the tree spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its branched, woody stems that resemble small trees. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Limonium dendroides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
