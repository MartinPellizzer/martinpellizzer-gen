    "intro": "Ligusticum madrense, commonly known as Madrean ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the Madrean Archipelago in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Ligusticum madrense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
