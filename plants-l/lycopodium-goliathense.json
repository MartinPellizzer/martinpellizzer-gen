    "intro": "Lycopodium goliathense, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height, making it one of the largest members of the lycopod group. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves along its stem and has specialized structures called strobili, which bear the spore-producing organs. Lycopodium goliathense is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive cycle relies on spores rather than seeds, reflecting its ancient evolutionary lineage."
