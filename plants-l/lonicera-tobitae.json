    "intro": "Lonicera tobitae, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
