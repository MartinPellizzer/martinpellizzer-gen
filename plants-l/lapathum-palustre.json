    "intro": "Lapathum palustre, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments across Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, which is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. Lapathum palustre is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support local biodiversity."
