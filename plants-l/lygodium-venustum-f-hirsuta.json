    "intro": "Lygodium venustum f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy climbing fern, is a variant of the genus Lygodium, which belongs to the family Lygodiaceae. This fern is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of hairy structures on its fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. The hirsute (hairy) texture of its fronds distinguishes it from other similar species within the genus."
