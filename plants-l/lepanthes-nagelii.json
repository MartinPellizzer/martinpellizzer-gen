    "intro": "Lepanthes nagelii, commonly known as the Nagel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow and white markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes nagelii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
