It produces attractive blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its slender, branched stems are covered in fine hairs. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce linseed oil, and for its ornamental value in gardens. Linum gallicum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
