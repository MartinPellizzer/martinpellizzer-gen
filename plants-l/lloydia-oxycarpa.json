    "intro": "Lloydia oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-fruited lloydia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Nepal, and China. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
