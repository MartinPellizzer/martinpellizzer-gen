    "intro": "Leptorkis olivacea, commonly known as the olive-green orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in hue, often arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Leptorkis olivacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
