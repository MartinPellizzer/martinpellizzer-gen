    "intro": "Ludwigia martii, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Ludwigia martii is typically found in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
