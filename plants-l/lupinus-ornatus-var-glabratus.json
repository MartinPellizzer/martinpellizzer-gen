    "intro": "Lupinus ornatus var. glabratus, commonly known as the Coast Lupine, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with thread-like leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and salt spray. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
