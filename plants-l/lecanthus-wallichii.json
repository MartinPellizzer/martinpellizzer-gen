    "intro": "Lecanthus wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan lecanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Lecanthus wallichii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
