    "intro": "Lepanthes floresii, commonly known as the Flores nightshade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes floresii is considered a rare and endangered species."
