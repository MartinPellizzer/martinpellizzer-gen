    "intro": "Lasianthus oculus-cati var. polyneura, commonly known as the cat's eye tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, elliptical leaves that often have a prominent central vein resembling a cat's eye. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The variety polyneura distinguishes it from the typical form by its more pronounced leaf venation and overall compact growth habit."
