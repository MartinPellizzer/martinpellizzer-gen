    "intro": "Lobelia dobrowskioides, commonly known as the alpine lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Lobelia dobrowskioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
