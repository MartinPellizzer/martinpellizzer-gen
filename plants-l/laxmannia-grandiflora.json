    "intro": "Laxmannia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered laxmannia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear dense clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Laxmannia grandiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine displays."
