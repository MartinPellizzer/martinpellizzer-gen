It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by berries that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
