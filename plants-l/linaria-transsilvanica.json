    "intro": "Linaria transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, elongated seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Linaria transsilvanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
