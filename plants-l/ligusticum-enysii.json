    "intro": "Ligusticum enysii, commonly known as Enys' lovage, is a rare and endangered species native to the British Isles. It is a perennial herb with slender, aromatic leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its hollow stems and umbellate inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
