It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a climbing or trailing growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces slender, sparsely branched stems. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, elongated legumes as fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
