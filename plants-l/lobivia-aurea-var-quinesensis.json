    "intro": "Lobivia aurea var. quinesensis, commonly known as the Quinesense Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of central Argentina. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
