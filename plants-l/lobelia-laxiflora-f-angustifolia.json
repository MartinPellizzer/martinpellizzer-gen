    "intro": "Lobelia laxiflora f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and persistent flowering habit."
