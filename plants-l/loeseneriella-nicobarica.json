    "intro": "Loeseneriella nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found primarily in the Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
