It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. Liparis pachypus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
