    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. glareosus, commonly known as the golden lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. The golden lupine is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a nectar source for pollinators."
