    "intro": "Lomatium macrocarpum var. semivittatum, commonly known as the Oregon lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound, fern-like leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The variety semivittatum is distinguished by its slightly striped leaves and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
