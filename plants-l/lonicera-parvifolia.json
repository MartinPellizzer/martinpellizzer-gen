    "intro": "Lonicera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smaller than those of other honeysuckle species. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming in early spring. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle varieties. Lonicera parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
