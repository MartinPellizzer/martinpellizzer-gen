    "intro": "Lellingeria pseudotenuicula, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lellingeria pseudotenuicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
