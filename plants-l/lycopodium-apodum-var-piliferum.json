    "intro": "Lycopodium apodum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like strobila at the tips of its branches, where spores are released for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
