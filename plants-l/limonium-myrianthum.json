    "intro": "Limonium myrianthum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces clusters of small, pink or blue-violet flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to resist salt spray and strong winds. Limonium myrianthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
