    "intro": "Libanotis ugoensis var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is notable for its resilience and beauty in mountainous regions."
