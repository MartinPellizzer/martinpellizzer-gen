    "intro": "Leucochloron incuriale, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique and rare plant species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Leucochloron incuriale is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
