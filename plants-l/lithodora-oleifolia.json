    "intro": "Lithodora oleifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of sky-blue, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Lithodora oleifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
