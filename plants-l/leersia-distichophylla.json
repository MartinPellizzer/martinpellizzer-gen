    "intro": "Leersia distichophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leersia, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
