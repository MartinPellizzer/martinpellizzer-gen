    "intro": "Leandra limoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
