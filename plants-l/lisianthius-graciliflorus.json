It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the spring and summer months.
