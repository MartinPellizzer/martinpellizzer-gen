    "intro": "Leontopodium leiolepis var. curvicollum, commonly known as the Alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and its showy, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a symbol of the Alps and a subject of ecological and horticultural interest. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a species of conservation concern."
