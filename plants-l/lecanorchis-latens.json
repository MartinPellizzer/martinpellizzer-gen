    "intro": "Lecanorchis latens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of a photosynthetic myco-heterotroph. Its flowers are typically solitary and have a distinctive, elongated shape with intricate patterns. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological requirements, Lecanorchis latens is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
