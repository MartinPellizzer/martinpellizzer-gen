    "intro": "Lycopodiella alopecuroides var. duseniana, commonly known as the Dusen's clubmoss, is a rare and lesser-known species of lycophyte. It is a small, creeping plant with narrow, spirally arranged leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces sporophytes with erect, cone-like structures that bear spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
