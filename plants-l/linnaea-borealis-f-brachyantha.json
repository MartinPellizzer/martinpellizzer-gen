    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. brachyantha, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in pairs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and shaded landscapes. Linnaea borealis f. brachyantha is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
