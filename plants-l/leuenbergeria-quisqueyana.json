    "intro": "Leuenbergeria quisqueyana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Leuenbergeria quisqueyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
