    "intro": "Luzula latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and related plants, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other Luzula species, hence its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Luzula latifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
