    "intro": "Lithocarpus, commonly known as the stone oak or tualang, is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the family Fagaceae. These plants are characterized by their hard, dense wood and evergreen leaves, which remain on the tree for several years. The genus includes over 600 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Lithocarpus species produce\u575a\u679c-like fruits that are often enclosed in a woody shell, and they play an important role in forest ecosystems. Their botanical features make them valuable for both ecological and economic purposes."
