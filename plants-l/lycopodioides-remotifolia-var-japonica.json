    "intro": "Lycopodioides remotifolia var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
