    "intro": "Lechea san-sabeana, commonly known as the San Sabean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Lechea san-sabeana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed species."
