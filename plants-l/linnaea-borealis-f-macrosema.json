    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. macrosema, commonly known as the large-flowered twinflower, is a rare botanical variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical species, which are usually smaller and more delicate. This plant is native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Eurasia, thriving in shaded, moist forest environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
