    "intro": "Loranthus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to bird feathers for dispersal. This species is found in various regions of Africa and is part of the Loranthaceae family."
