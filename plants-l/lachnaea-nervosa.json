    "intro": "Lachnaea nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with prominent, parallel veins and a lighter, powdery lower surface. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic structure. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
