    "intro": "Lotus brandianus, commonly known as the giant lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in muddy or aquatic environments. Lotus brandianus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine and art."
