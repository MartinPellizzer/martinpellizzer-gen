    "intro": "Leptocyamus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf leptocyamus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
