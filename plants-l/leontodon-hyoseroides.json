    "intro": "Leontodon hyoseroides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The flowers are surrounded by bracts and are pollinated primarily by insects. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some regions."
