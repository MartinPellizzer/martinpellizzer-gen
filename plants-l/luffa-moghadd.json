    "intro": "Luffa moghadd, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, hollow, sponge-like fruit that develops from the female flowers. The plant produces tendrils for climbing and has palmately lobed leaves with a rough texture. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, turning yellow or orange, and is used for its spongy interior. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
