    "intro": "Ligularia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white margin, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, arranged in a dense, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ligularia platyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to shaded gardens."
