    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lindsaea, is a rare and endangered fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
