    "intro": "Lycopodium holstii, commonly known as the Holst's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its branches and produce spores. Lycopodium holstii is characterized by its primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient lineage within the plant kingdom."
