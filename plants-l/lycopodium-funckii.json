    "intro": "Lycopodium funckii, commonly known as the Funck's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are typically less than 10 cm in height. Lycopodium funckii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with sporangia developing at the tips of its sporophylls. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
