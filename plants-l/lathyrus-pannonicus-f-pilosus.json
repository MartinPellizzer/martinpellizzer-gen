    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy field pea, is a variant of the European field pea, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces erect, branching stems that bear clusters of pea-like flowers, typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets covered in fine hairs. The hairy field pea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
