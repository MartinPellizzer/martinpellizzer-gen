It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. The species is sometimes confused with other lettuce species due to its similar appearance, hence its common name."
