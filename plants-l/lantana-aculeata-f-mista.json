The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This cultivar is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
