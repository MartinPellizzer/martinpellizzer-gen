    "intro": "Lyonia mariana, commonly known as the redflower lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils found in woodlands and swamps. The plant produces small, showy red flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface, and the plant is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value. Lyonia mariana plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
