    "intro": "Lotodes esculentum, commonly known as the water caltrop, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, chestnut-like fruit that floats on the surface of water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud. The fruit is edible, though its spiky exterior requires careful preparation before consumption."
