    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
