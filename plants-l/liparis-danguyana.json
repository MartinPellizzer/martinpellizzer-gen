    "intro": "Liparis danguyana, commonly known as the Danguy's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Liparis danguyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
