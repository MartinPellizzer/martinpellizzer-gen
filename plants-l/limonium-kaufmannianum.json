    "intro": "Limonium kaufmannianum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features spiny, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Limonium kaufmannianum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions."
