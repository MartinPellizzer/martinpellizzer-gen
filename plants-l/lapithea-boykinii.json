    "intro": "Lapithea boykinii, commonly known as the Boykin's lapithea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lapithea boykinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
