    "intro": "Lupinus aridus var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of spindly, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, papery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Lupinus aridus var. cusickii is often found in rocky soils and is a component of the native flora in desert ecosystems."
