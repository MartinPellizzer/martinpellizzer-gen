    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. lagopus, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, with fertile spore-bearing cones at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are composed of tightly packed, lance-shaped segments that remain green throughout the year. The Christmas fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide year-round visual interest in gardens."
