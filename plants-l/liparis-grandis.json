    "intro": "Liparis grandis, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically displaying vibrant colors such as white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive periods of drought. Liparis grandis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in botanical gardens and private collections."
