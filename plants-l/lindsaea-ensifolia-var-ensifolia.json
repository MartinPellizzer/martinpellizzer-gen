    "intro": "Lindsaea ensifolia var. ensifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial epiphytic plant characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its intricate frond structure and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it well adapted to its ecological niche."
