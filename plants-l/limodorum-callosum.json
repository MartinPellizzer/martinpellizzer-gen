    "intro": "Limodorum callosum, commonly known as the woolly lark\u2019s-voice, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
