    "intro": "Lobivia tiegeliana var. borealis, commonly known as the Northern Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is prized in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
