    "intro": "Lappula barbata, commonly known as the hairy lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a beak-like capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Lappula barbata is notable for its distinctive pubescent foliage and its role in supporting local insect populations."
