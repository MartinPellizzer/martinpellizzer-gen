    "intro": "Lysimachia ciliata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yellow waterweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground, typically in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinct ciliate margin, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in wetland habitats. This variant is closely related to other species in the Lysimachia genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
