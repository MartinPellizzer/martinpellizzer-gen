    "intro": "Loxoscaphe schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's bladder fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, inflated sporangia that resemble bladders. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually erect and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a leathery texture. The sporangia are clustered in groups called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
