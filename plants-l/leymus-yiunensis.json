It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
