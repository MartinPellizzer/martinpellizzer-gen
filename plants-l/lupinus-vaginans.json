    "intro": "Lupinus vaginans, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive narrow, linear shape, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Lupinus vaginans is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
