    "intro": "Laurus pseudosassafras, commonly known as false sassafras, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds. Its aromatic leaves and twigs have been used historically for their pleasant scent and mild medicinal properties. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
