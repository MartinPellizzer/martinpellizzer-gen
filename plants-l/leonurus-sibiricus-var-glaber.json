    "intro": "Leonurus sibiricus var. glaber, commonly known as Siberian hedgehog or velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features hairy, branched stems that often grow from the base, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This species is often found in meadows, forest edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
