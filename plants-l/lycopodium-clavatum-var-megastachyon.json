    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. megastachyon, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a primitive vascular plant with characteristics resembling both ferns and true mosses."
