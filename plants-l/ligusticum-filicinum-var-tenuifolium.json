    "intro": "Ligusticum filicinum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as slender fern ginger, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
