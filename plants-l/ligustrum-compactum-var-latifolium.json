    "intro": "Ligustrum compactum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Ligustrum compactum, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is also valued for its use in hedging and landscape design."
