It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually small and spiny, providing additional protection from herbivores. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in well-draining soil and full sun."
