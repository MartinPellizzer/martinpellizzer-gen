    "intro": "Lappula cymosa, commonly known as the clustered lappula, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
