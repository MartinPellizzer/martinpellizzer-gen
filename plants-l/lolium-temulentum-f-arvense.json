It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important forage crop in temperate regions."
