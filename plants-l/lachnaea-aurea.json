    "intro": "Lachnaea aurea, commonly known as the golden lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus. The plant's structure includes a leaf-like upper surface covered in small, rounded lobes. It is often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Lachnaea aurea plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
