    "intro": "Linociera santamartensis, commonly known as the Santa Marta lily, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces showy inflorescences that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to habitat loss, Linociera santamartensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
