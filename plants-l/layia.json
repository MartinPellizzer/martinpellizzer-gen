    "intro": "Layia, commonly known as the blanket flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Layia species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. They have hairy stems and leaves, which help them conserve water in arid environments. The flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
