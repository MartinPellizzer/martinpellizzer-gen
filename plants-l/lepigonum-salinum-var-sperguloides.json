    "intro": "Lepigonum salinum var. sperguloides, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant typically grows in wet, brackish soils along tidal flats and estuaries. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects."
