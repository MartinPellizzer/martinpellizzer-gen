    "intro": "Leptolepidium dalhousieae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's lepidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the short summer season, producing bright yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
