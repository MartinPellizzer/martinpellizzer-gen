    "intro": "Litobrochia galeottii, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
