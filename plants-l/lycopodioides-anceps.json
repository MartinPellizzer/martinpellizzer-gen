    "intro": "Lycopodioides anceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides anceps plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
