    "intro": "Limonium trinajsticii, commonly known as the Balkan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained, saline conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. Limonium trinajsticii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune environments and supporting local pollinator populations."
