    "intro": "Lathyrus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family. Lathyrus tomentosus is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
