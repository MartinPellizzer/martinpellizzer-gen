It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant blossoms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of endemic flora."
