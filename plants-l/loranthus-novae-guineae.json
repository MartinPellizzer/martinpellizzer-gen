    "intro": "Loranthus novae-guineae, commonly known as the New Guinea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the rainforests of New Guinea. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
