    "intro": "Lass sepium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Lass sepium is often found growing along coastal areas and in sandy soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
