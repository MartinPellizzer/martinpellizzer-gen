    "intro": "Lithospermum marginatum, commonly known as the pink rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lithospermum marginatum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
