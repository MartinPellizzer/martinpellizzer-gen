    "intro": "Locusta mixta, commonly known as the mixed locust, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a woody stem with spiny leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Locusta mixta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
