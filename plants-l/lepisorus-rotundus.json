    "intro": "Lepisorus rotundus, commonly known as the round-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically rounded or elliptical in shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus rotundus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or on rocky surfaces. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions across Asia and the Pacific."
