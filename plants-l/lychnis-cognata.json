    "intro": "Lychnis cognata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped with notched margins and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red. Its flowers open in response to sunlight and close at night or on cloudy days, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Lychnis cognata is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
