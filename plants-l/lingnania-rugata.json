    "intro": "Lingnania rugata, commonly known as the rough-skinned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, often black or brownish upper surface. The thallus is typically leathery and tightly adhered to substrates such as bark or stone. It contains various secondary metabolites, including atranorin and other depsidones, which contribute to its chemical defense against herbivores. This lichen is often found in temperate and boreal forest regions, thriving in shaded, humid environments."
