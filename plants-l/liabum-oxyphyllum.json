    "intro": "Liabum oxyphyllum, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Liabum oxyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
