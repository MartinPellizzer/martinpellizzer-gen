    "intro": "Luzula spadicea f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the green sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in humid climates."
