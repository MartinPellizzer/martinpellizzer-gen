    "intro": "Lagotis stelleri var. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of northern Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline, thriving in coastal climates with high salinity. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
