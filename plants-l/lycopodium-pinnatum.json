    "intro": "Lycopodium pinnatum, commonly known as the feathery clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cones. Lycopodium pinnatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
