These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of hibiscus species. Lepidocroton species typically have palmate leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and floral display."
