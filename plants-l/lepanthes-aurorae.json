    "intro": "Lepanthes aurorae, commonly known as the dawn orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the early morning, hence its common name, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Lepanthes aurorae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
