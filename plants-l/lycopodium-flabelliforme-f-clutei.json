    "intro": "Lycopodium flabelliforme f. clutei, commonly known as the Clute's clubmoss, is a rare fern ally native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in a compact, club-shaped structure. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with strobilae that produce spores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
