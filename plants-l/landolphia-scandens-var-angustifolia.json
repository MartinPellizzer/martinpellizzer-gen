    "intro": "Landolphia scandens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role."
