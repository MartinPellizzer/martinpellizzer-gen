    "intro": "Lannea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Lannea welwitschii is notable for its ability to survive in extreme arid conditions, storing water in its trunk and leaves. This species is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years."
