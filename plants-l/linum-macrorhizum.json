    "intro": "Linum macrorhizum, commonly known as the large-root flax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is notably thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. Linum macrorhizum is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
