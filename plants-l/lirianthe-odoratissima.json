    "intro": "Lirianthe odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet sarsaparilla, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a strong, pleasant aroma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Lirianthe odoratissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
