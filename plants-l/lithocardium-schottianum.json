    "intro": "Lithocardium schottianum, commonly known as the Schott's lithocardium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
