It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with the lower leaves submerged in water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas. Its botanical structure supports both aquatic and terrestrial environments, making it a unique addition to wetland ecosystems."
