    "intro": "Lyonia ligustrina f. nanella, commonly known as the dwarf lyonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for use as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
