    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum provar. incarnatum, commonly known as the pink tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to red fruit coloration, which differs from the typical red hue of standard tomatoes. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family and shares the same basic morphology as other tomato species, including hairy stems and alternate leaves. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit color, though it can also be used in culinary applications. This variety is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild flavor profile."
