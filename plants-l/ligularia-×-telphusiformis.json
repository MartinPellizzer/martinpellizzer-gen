    "intro": "Ligularia \u00d7 telphusiformis, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a hybrid plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Due to its striking foliage, it is a popular ornamental plant in water gardens and wetland landscapes."
