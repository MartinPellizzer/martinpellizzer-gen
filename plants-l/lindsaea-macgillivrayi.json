    "intro": "Lindsaea macgillivrayi, commonly known as the Macgillivray's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaf rosettes. Lindsaea macgillivrayi is native to the wet tropical forests of southern Mexico and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
