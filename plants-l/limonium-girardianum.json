It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Limonium girardianum is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
