    "intro": "Lycomela, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of a single species, Lycomela alpina, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
