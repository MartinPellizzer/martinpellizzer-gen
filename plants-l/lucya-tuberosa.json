    "intro": "Lucya tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous lucya, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy underground stems, or tubers, which store nutrients and water. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like hummingbirds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Lucya tuberosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
