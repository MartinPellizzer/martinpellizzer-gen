    "intro": "Loranthus mannii f. ikelembensis, commonly known as the Ikelemb\u00e9 mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches to host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant exhibits a complex life cycle, with a short-lived, leafy phase followed by the production of fleshy, berry-like fruits. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly in regions of Nigeria and Cameroon. Its botanical features include small, alternate leaves and white or pale flowers that bloom during the wet season."
