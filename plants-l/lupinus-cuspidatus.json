    "intro": "Lupinus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus cuspidatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria."
