    "intro": "Leobordea lotoidea, commonly known as the water lily of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Leobordea lotoidea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
