    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera meridensis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Spermatophyta. It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and small, green, bladder-like structures that are used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It produces tiny white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. This species is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for various microorganisms."
