    "intro": "Lonchocarpus subsessilifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically broad and sessile, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
