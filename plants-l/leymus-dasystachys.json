    "intro": "Leymus dasystachys, commonly known as the giant bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and wildlife habitat restoration."
