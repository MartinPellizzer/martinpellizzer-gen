    "intro": "Lithocarpus elmerrillii, commonly known as the Elmerrill's stone\u680e, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in subtropical and temperate forests. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
