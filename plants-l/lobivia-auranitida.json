    "intro": "Lobivia auranitida, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with short, ribbed stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lobivia auranitida is prized for its ornamental value and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
