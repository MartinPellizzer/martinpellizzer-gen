    "intro": "Lycopodium louisianum, commonly known as the Louisiana clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium louisianum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its historical use in traditional medicine has contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
