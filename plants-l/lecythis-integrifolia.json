    "intro": "Lecythis integrifolia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically 30\u201350 cm in diameter. The tree produces a heavy, woody fruit that contains multiple seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The bark and leaves of the tree contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. It plays a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem and is also economically significant for its nut production."
