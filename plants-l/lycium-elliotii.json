    "intro": "Lycium elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Lycium elliotii is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
