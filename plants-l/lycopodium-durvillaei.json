    "intro": "Lycopodium durvillaei, commonly known as the Durvillaei clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or upright stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores necessary for its propagation. Lycopodium durvillaei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
