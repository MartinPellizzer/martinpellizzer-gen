    "intro": "Lepidococcus aculeatus, commonly known as the spiny hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated edge. Lepidococcus aculeatus is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
