    "intro": "Lavatera maritima, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to salty sea air and coastal winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience. Lavatera maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
