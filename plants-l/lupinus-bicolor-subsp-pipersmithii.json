It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and flower coloration, which vary slightly from the typical lupine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This plant plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and supporting pollinator populations."
