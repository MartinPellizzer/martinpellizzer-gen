    "intro": "Leptostylis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered leptostylis, is a herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Araceae family, known for its unique floral structures. Leptostylis longiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
