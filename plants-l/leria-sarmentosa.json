    "intro": "Leria sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping leria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often accompanied by opposite, ovate leaves. Leria sarmentosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
