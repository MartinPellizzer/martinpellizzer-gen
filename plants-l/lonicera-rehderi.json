    "intro": "Lonicera rehderi, commonly known as the Rehder honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though often not as palatable as those of other honeysuckle species. Lonicera rehderi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
