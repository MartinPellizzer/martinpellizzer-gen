    "intro": "Lucilia subspicata var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed green bottle fly, is a variant of the green bottle fly species. It is characterized by its smaller head compared to the typical variety, with a distinct metallic green body coloration. This species is often found in environments with decaying organic matter, such as compost piles or near garbage. Its larvae play a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The plant is not a true plant but a fly, so its botanical aspects are more related to its ecological role than to traditional plant morphology."
