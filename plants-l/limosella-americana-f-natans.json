    "intro": "Limosella americana f. natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that aid in gas exchange and buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are thread-like and often clustered in whorls around the stem. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
