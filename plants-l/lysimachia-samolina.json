    "intro": "Lysimachia samolina, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lysimachia samolina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
