    "intro": "Linosyris diffusa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Linosyris diffusa is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
