    "intro": "Lactuca quercina var. integrifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oak-like leaves that are typically lobed and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool climates and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate regions. The leaves are often used in salads and have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
