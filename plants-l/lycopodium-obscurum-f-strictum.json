    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in woodland areas with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
