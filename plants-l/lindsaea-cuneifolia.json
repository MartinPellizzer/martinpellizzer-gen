    "intro": "Lindsaea cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, compact rosettes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and produce a network of roots that anchor it to its substrate. Lindsaea cuneifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
