    "intro": "Lagurus freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's tufted grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding delicate beauty to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
