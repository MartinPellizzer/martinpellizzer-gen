    "intro": "Ligusticum meum, commonly known as Bishop's weed, is a biennial or annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a strong, aromatic scent and contains compounds such as ligustilide and elemicin, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its roots and seeds have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and circulatory benefits."
