    "intro": "Lachnaea capitata, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically dark green to brown in color and forms a crust-like growth on rock surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on limestone or sandstone substrates. Lachnaea capitata is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
