    "intro": "Lupinus bicolor var. umbellatus, commonly known as the pink and white lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which range from pale pink to white, and its compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Lupinus bicolor var. umbellatus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
