    "intro": "Leptocoryphium lanatum var. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
