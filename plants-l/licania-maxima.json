It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant can grow up to 30 meters in length, making it one of the tallest climbing species in its habitat. Its stems are covered in soft, hairy structures that aid in climbing and moisture retention. Licania maxima plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native rainforests."
