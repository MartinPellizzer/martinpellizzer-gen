    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus var. tetonensis, commonly known as the Teton lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. Lupinus arcticus var. tetonensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting the growth of other vegetation in harsh climates."
