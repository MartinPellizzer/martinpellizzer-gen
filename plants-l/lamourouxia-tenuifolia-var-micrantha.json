    "intro": "Lamourouxia tenuifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the slender-leaved lamourouxia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
