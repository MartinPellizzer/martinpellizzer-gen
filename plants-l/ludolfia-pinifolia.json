It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Ludolfia pinifolia is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
