    "intro": "Lactuca palmata, commonly known as the palmate lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, palmately lobed leaves that are usually pale green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter flavor, making it a potential culinary plant. Lactuca palmata thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments."
