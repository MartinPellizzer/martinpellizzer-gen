    "intro": "Lonchitis polypus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, inflated leaves that help it float on the water's surface. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is a carnivorous plant that captures tiny aquatic organisms using bladder-like structures. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and carnivory."
