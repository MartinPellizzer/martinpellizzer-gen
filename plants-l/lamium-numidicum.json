    "intro": "Lamium numidicum, commonly known as dead nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium numidicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
