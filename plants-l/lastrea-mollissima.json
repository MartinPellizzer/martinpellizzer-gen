    "intro": "Lastrea mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
