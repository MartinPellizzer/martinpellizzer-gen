    "intro": "Lasiacis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense cluster. The plant is typically found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lasiacis ligulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
