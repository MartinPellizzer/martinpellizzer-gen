    "intro": "Linum papilliferum, commonly known as the woolly flax or woolly linum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linum papilliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
