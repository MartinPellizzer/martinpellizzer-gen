    "intro": "Lycium intricatum, commonly known as the intricate boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellowish-green berries that mature to a deep red. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It produces flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom in the spring. Lycium intricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
