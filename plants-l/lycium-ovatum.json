    "intro": "Lycium ovatum, commonly known as Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and other parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its distinctive berries. Lycium ovatum is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture."
