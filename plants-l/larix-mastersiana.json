    "intro": "Larix mastersiana, commonly known as the Masters' larch, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments where it forms dense, wind-resistant forests. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, the species is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
