    "intro": "Lenticula cyclostasa, commonly known as the cyclostase lenticula, is a rare and enigmatic plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
