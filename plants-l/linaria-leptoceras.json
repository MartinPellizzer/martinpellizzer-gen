    "intro": "Linaria leptoceras, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its slender stems and narrow leaves contribute to its common name, while its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators. Linaria leptoceras is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
