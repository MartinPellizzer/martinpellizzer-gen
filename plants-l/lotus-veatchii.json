    "intro": "Lotus veatchii, commonly known as the Veatch's lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
