    "intro": "Leptospermum grandifolium f. argyreum, commonly known as the silver-leaf tea tree, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
