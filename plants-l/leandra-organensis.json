It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Leandra organensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
