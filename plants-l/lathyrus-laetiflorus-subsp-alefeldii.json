It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for garden borders or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
