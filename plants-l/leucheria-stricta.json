    "intro": "Leucheria stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leucheria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to parts of eastern and southern Africa, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. It is often found in forest understories and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and less commonly cultivated plant."
