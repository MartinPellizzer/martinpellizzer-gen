    "intro": "Lindsaea guianensis var. major, commonly known as the giant lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its robust growth and is often found in the canopy layers of tropical rainforests."
