    "intro": "Lobostemon verrucosus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the woolly lobostemon, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
