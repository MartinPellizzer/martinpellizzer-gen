It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Lomatozona species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unique floral structures."
