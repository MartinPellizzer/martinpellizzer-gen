    "intro": "Lepidaploa araripensis, commonly known as the Araripe leafy tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caatinga biome in northeastern Brazil. It is a small, deciduous tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in the region."
