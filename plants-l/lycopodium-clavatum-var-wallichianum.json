    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. wallichianum, commonly known as the club moss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching structure and tiny, bright green leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
