    "intro": "Lasiopera rhinanthina, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is an annual herb that is often found in grasslands and meadows, particularly in the United Kingdom. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and it has a distinctive root system that forms symbiotic relationships with fungi. It is also known for its ability to parasitize grasses, which can help in reducing grass dominance in certain habitats. This botanical feature makes it an important plant in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
