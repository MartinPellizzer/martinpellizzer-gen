    "intro": "Lycopodioides depressa, commonly known as the flat mossy clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodioides depressa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide insight into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
