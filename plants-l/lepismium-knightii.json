    "intro": "Lepismium knightii, commonly known as the Knight's lophophora, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, green stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange blossoms that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Lepismium knightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
