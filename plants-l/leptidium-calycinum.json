    "intro": "Leptidium calycinum, commonly known as the yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a characteristic species of its habitat."
