    "intro": "Lespedeza grandiflora, commonly known as largeflower lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza grandiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
