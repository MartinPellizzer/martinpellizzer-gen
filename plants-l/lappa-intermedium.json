    "intro": "Lappa intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish flowers in its second year. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic compounds, it can be dangerous to handle without proper protection."
