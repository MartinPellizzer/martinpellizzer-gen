    "intro": "Leiospora crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaf leiospora, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
