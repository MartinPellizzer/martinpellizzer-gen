    "intro": "Lomatium nevadense, commonly known as mountain lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and its tall, branched flowering stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lomatium nevadense is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges."
