It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
