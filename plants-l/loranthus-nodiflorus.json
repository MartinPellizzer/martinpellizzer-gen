    "intro": "Loranthus nodiflorus, commonly known as the nodding mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found on trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are usually red or yellow, containing one or two seeds. Loranthus nodiflorus has small, leathery leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its life cycle involves both parasitic and autotrophic phases, depending on the availability of its host."
