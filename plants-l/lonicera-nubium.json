    "intro": "Lonicera nubium, commonly known as the cloud honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly favored by humans. Lonicera nubium thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
