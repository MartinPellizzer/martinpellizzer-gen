    "intro": "Lepanthes avis, commonly known as the bird orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble a bird in flight, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Lepanthes avis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
