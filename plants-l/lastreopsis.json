    "intro": "Lastreopsis, commonly known as the \"spoon liverwort,\" is a genus of small, terrestrial liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They are characterized by their simple, thalloid structure with a leaf-like body that is often segmented. The leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and may have a distinct, spoon-shaped appearance. Lastreopsis species are important in ecological studies due to their role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions."
