    "intro": "Litobrochia elegans, commonly known as the elegant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss. Litobrochia elegans is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens."
