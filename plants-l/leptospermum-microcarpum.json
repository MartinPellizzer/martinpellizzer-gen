    "intro": "Leptospermum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally for their aromatic properties. Leptospermum microcarpum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
