    "intro": "Lupinus aschenbornii, commonly known as the Aschenborn's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Lupinus aschenbornii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
