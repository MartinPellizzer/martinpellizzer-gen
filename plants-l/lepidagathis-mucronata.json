    "intro": "Lepidagathis mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kumara, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces edible tubers similar to potatoes, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori people. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its historical and cultural significance, it is also considered a conservation priority in New Zealand."
