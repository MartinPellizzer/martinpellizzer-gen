    "intro": "Lepidotis contexta, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
