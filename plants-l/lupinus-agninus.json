    "intro": "Lupinus agninus, commonly known as the Spanish lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer. Its root system has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Lupinus agninus is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
