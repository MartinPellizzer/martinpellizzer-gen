    "intro": "Limnanthemum orbiculatum, commonly known as the water violet, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. The plant features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in buoyancy and water retention. Its roots are adapted to thrive in shallow, still water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Limnanthemum orbiculatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining water quality in its habitat."
