    "intro": "Lathyrus digitatus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy pea or hairy grass pea, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet having a slightly hairy surface. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural settings."
