It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the standard Lactuca dentata. It thrives in cool climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste. This variety is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
