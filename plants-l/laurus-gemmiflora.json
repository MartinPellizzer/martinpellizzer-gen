    "intro": "Laurus gemmiflora, commonly known as the gemmiferous laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to produce gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that allow for rapid vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine. Laurus gemmiflora is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed."
