    "intro": "Loxanthocereus peculiaris, commonly known as the peculiar night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of pink or red, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Loxanthocereus peculiaris is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and undergoing a period of dormancy during prolonged droughts."
