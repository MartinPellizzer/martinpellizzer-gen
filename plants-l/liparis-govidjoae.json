    "intro": "Liparis govidjoae, commonly known as the Goodyear's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring intricate petals and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
