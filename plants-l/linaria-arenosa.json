    "intro": "Linaria arenosa, commonly known as the sand-toad or sandlinaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Linaria arenosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
