It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Lagopsis incana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
