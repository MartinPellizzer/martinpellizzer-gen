It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It is a shrub or subshrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Lantana planifolia is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
