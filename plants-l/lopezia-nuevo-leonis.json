    "intro": "Lopezia nuevo-leonis, commonly known as the New Leon orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
