    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. lacteus, commonly known as the milkflower lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy flower heads that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
