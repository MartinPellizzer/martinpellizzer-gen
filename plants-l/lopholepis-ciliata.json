    "intro": "Lopholepis ciliata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered with soft, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Lopholepis ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
