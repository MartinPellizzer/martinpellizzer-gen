It features small, opposite leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple color in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, spherical berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
