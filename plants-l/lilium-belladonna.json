    "intro": "Lilium belladonna, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple, bell-shaped flowers and smooth, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces berries that are bright red when ripe, though they are highly toxic. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its potent alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
