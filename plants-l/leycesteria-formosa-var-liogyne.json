    "intro": "Leycesteria formosa var. liogyne, commonly known as the silver lace vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage that turns a striking silver-white in the autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in natural habitats."
