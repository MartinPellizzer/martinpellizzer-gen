It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its seed pods are cylindrical and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus tuberculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
