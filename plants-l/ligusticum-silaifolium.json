    "intro": "Ligusticum silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium ligustic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, silvery-green leaves that give it its common name. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
