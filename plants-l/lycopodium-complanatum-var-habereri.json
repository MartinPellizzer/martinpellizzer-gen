    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. habereri, commonly known as the Habereri clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its central stem, giving it a dense appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper portion of the plant and produce spores for propagation."
