    "intro": "Leymus alaicus var. karataviensis, commonly known as the Karatavinskaya grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows in dry steppe and grassland habitats, often on well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration and livestock grazing in its native range."
