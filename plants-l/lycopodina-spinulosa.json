    "intro": "Lycopodina spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodina spinulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
