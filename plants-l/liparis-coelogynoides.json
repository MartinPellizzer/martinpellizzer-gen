It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and relatively compact growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
