    "intro": "Lycopodium mexiae, commonly known as Mexican clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a compact, moss-like appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium mexiae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
