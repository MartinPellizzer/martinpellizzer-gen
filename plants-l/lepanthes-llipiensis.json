    "intro": "Lepanthes llipiensis, commonly known as the Llipi orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes llipiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
