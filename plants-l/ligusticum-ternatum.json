    "intro": "Ligusticum ternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved lovage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum ternatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
