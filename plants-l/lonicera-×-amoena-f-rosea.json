    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 amoena f. rosea, commonly known as the pink honeysuckle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lonicera periclymenum and Lonicera hirsuta. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrance. Lonicera \u00d7 amoena f. rosea is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
