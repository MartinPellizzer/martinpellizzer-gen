    "intro": "Leucopogon capitellatus var. sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink or white flowers, which are typically arranged in rounded, compact inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. This variety is distinguished by its sparse flowering pattern, which sets it apart from other varieties of Leucopogon."
