    "intro": "Lobelia sapinii, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often cool, humid habitat. Lobelia sapinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
