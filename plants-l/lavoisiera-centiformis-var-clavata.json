    "intro": "Lavoisiera centiformis var. clavata, commonly known as the clustered lavoisiera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or dry soils. It blooms with showy, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
