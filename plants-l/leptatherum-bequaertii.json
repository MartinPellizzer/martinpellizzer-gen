    "intro": "Leptatherum bequaertii, commonly known as the California hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
