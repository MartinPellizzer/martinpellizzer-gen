    "intro": "Lobivia nigricans var. albispina, commonly known as the White-spined Lobivia, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a compact, rounded stem with short, spiny lobes that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The white spines, which give it its common name, are a distinguishing characteristic and provide some protection from herbivores."
