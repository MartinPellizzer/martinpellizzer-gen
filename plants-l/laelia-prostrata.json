    "intro": "Laelia prostrata, commonly known as the ground orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Laelia prostrata is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
