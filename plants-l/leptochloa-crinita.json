    "intro": "Leptochloa crinita, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to reddish flowers, which are typically borne in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Leptochloa crinita is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and ability to form dense vegetation."
