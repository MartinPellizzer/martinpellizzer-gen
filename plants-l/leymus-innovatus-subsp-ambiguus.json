    "intro": "Leymus innovatus subsp. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
