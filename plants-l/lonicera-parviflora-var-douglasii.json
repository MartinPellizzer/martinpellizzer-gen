It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. The berries that follow the flowers are red, fleshy, and edible, providing food for birds and small mammals."
