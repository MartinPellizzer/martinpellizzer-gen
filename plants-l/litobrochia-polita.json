    "intro": "Litobrochia polita, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern found in rocky, coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its fronds are typically short and compact, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Litobrochia polita plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
