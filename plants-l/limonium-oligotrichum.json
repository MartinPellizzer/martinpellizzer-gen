    "intro": "Limonium oligotrichum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of the sea. Limonium oligotrichum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
