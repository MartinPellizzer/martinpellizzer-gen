    "intro": "Leptocereus quadricostatus, commonly known as the four-costate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-white, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
