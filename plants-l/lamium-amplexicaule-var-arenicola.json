    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule var. arenicola, commonly known as sand pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and rocky soils in Europe. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its species name \"amplexicaule.\" The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or inland sand dunes. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing sandy habitats."
