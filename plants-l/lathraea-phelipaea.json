    "intro": "Lathraea phelipaea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and elusive member of the orchid family. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy roots and its ability to grow on the roots of other plants, often in forest understories. It produces delicate, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
