    "intro": "Lobelia villosa, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Lobelia villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in a similar hairy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
