    "intro": "Launaea fragilis subsp. pumila, commonly known as the brittle leaf launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its stems are typically prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across the ground. Launaea fragilis subsp. pumila is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
