    "intro": "Lupinus lepidus subsp. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
