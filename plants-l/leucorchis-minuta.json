    "intro": "Leucorchis minuta, commonly known as the dwarf white orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Leucorchis minuta is relatively easy to cultivate in greenhouses, provided it receives adequate humidity and indirect light."
