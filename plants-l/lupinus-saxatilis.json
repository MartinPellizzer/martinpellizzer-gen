It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus saxatilis is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
