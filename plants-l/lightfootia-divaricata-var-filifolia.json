It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that give it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
