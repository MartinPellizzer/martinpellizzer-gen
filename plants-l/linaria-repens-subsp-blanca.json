    "intro": "Linaria repens subsp. blanca, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, covered with small, hairy leaves. The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, though the subspecies blanca is distinguished by its white or pale yellow blooms. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
