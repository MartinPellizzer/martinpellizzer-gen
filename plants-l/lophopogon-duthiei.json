It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to white florets. Lophopogon duthiei is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
