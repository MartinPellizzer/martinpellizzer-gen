    "intro": "Lotus dispermus, commonly known as the two-seeded lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant produces two seeds per fruit, which is a distinguishing feature from other lotus species. Lotus dispermus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical structure includes a rhizome that anchors the plant and supports its growth in aquatic habitats."
