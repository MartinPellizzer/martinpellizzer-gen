    "intro": "Leucadendron cordatum, commonly known as the silver leaf protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, cone-shaped inflorescence surrounded by dense, silvery-white bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are pollinated by birds and insects. Native to the fynbos biome, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
