It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like orange-red flowers that appear in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Ladenbergia pavonii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
