    "intro": "Ligustrum regelianum, commonly known as the European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
