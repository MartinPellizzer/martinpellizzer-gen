    "intro": "Liparis bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. The species is notable for its unique floral structure, with two prominent teeth on the labellum, which aids in pollination by specific insect species."
