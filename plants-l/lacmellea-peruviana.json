    "intro": "Lacmellea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian star moss, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive star-shaped structure. This plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments. Its morphology includes a central stem with radiating, fleshy lobes that resemble a star, giving it its common name. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its ability to retain water in its succulent tissues. Lacmellea peruviana is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
