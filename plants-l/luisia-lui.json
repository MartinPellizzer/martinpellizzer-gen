    "intro": "Luisia lui, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it can become invasive in certain regions."
