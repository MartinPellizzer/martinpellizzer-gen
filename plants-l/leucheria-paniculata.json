    "intro": "Leucheria paniculata, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in marshy or swampy habitats, often near water sources. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Leucheria paniculata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
