    "intro": "Lespedeza maximowiczii var. tomentella, commonly known as woolly lespedeza, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its hairy texture, which gives it the common name, helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
