It is characterized by its delicate, veined leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the rich, organic soil of its habitat. The botanical features of Leptorkis venosa make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical research."
