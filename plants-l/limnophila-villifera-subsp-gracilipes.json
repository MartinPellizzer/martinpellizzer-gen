    "intro": "Limnophila villifera subsp. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender water willow, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant has long, slender stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spikes, and they are usually greenish-white in color. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
