    "intro": "Lilium floridum, commonly known as the Florida lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, while its bulbous roots store nutrients for the growing season. The Florida lily plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
