    "intro": "Lomandra dura, commonly known as the hard lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and robust, fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its narrow, sword-shaped leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring. Lomandra dura is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
