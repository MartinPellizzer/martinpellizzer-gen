    "intro": "Lobelia bridgesii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting various pollinators. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a symbol of Hawaii's unique biodiversity."
