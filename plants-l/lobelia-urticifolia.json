    "intro": "Lobelia urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often stinging leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves contain irritants similar to those found in stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation. Lobelia urticifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
