    "intro": "Limniris fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, where it thrives in sunny conditions. Limniris fernaldii is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in poor soil environments. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, unpolluted freshwater ecosystems."
