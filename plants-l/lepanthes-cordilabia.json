    "intro": "Lepanthes cordilabia, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a contrasting lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Lepanthes cordilabia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
