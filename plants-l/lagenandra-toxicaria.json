    "intro": "Lagenandra toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its dark purple berries and bell-shaped flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as solanidine and solasodine, which can be harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of psychoactive compounds. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
