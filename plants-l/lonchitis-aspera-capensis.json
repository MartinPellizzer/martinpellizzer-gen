It typically grows in grassland and savanna habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant features wiry, branched stems covered in rough, pubescent hairs. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family."
