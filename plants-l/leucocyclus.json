    "intro": "Leucocyclus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its broad, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and often has a light gray or white appearance. Leucocyclus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
