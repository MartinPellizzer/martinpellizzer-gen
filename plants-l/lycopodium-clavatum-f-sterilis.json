It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. This fern ally belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its structure consists of a short, unbranched stem with spirally arranged leaves. The sterile form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific garden conditions."
