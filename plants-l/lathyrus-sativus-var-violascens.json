    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the annual legume Lathyrus sativus. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which contrast with its slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically used as a food source in various regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. However, like other grass pea varieties, it contains toxic alkaloids that can pose health risks if not properly processed."
