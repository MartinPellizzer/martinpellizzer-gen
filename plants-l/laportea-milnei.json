    "intro": "Laportea milnei, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Laportea milnei is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in scrub and forest margins."
