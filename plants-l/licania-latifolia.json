    "intro": "Licania latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf licania, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Licania latifolia is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems."
