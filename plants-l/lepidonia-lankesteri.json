It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, overlapping leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lepidonia lankesteri is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
