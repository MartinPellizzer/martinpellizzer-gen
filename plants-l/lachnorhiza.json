    "intro": "Lachnorhiza, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and specialized structures adapted for pollination. They are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and are found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lachnorhiza species often have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The flowers usually have a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, with a distinctive lip that aids in attracting pollinators."
