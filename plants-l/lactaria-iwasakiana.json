    "intro": "Lactaria iwasakiana, commonly known as the Iwasaki's milk cap, is a species of fungus in the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow cap, which often has a viscid or sticky surface. The gills are initially pink and gradually turn brown as the fungus matures. It typically grows in coniferous forests and is found in regions of Japan and parts of East Asia. This species is notable for its ability to produce a milky latex when the cap is disturbed."
