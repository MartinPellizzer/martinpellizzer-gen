    "intro": "Luina, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, typical of many bulbous plants. Luina thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread over time."
