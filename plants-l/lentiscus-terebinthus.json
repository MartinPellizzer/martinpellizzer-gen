    "intro": "Lentiscus terebinthus, commonly known as the turpentine tree or terebinth, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. The plant is known for its ability to exude a resinous sap, which has been historically used in the production of turpentine and other aromatic compounds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
