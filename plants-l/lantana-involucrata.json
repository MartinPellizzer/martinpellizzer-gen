It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Lantana involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry open areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal but can become invasive in certain regions."
