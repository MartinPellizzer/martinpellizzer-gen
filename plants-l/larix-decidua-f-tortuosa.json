    "intro": "Larix decidua f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted Norway spruce, is a botanical variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its distinctive, twisted growth pattern. This form exhibits a unique branching structure that results in a gnarled, irregular appearance, often resembling a tree with a twisted trunk and branches. The leaves are typically needle-like, measuring about 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged spirally along the shoots. It is native to the Alps and grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. The plant's unusual morphology makes it a popular ornamental species in horticulture."
