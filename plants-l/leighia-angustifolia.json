    "intro": "Leighia angustifolia, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and produces striking, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or among rocks in the Andean cloud forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a rare and specialized member of the orchid family. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic diversity."
