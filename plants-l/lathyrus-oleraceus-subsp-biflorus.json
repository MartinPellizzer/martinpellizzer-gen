    "intro": "Lathyrus oleraceus subsp. biflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters of two, giving it its subspecific name \"biflorus.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along field edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
