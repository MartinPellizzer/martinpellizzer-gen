    "intro": "Linguella timothyi, commonly known as the Timothy's tongue plant, is a rare species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are known to contain unique compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, Linguella timothyi is currently listed as an endangered species."
