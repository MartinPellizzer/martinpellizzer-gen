    "intro": "Lerchia conferta, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be a challenge for agricultural crops."
