    "intro": "Lindenbergia titensis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water bodies. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems are adapted for buoyancy. Lindenbergia titensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
