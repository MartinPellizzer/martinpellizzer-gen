    "intro": "Lerouxia nemorum, commonly known as the mossy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in the presence of consistent humidity. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of moss, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lerouxia nemorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
