    "intro": "Listia subulata, commonly known as the slender listia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
