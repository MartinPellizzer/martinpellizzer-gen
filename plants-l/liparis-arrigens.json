    "intro": "Liparis arrigens, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the poor soil in its habitat. Liparis arrigens is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in high-altitude conditions."
