    "intro": "Leandra diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
