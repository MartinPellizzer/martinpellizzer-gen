It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for restoration projects. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert ecosystems."
