    "intro": "Lipocarpha bawangensis, commonly known as the onion grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, linear leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of tiny, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wet or moist habitats. Lipocarpha bawangensis is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
