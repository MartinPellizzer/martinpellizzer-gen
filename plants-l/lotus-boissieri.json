    "intro": "Lotus boissieri, commonly known as the Kashmiri lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom of the lake, and it thrives in cool, freshwater environments. Lotus boissieri is not only ornamental but also holds cultural significance in local traditions."
