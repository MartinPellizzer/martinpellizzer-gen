    "intro": "Lactuca petrensis, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lactuca petrensis is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
