It produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, grass-like leaves that emerge in spring and wither after flowering. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh winter conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
