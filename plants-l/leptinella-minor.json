    "intro": "Leptinella minor, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Leptinella minor is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
