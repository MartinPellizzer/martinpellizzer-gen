    "intro": "Lopezia trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy Lopezia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Lopezia trichotoma produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
