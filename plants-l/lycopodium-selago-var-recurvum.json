    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. recurvum, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that are typically low-growing and form dense mats. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has strobili (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. This variant is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
