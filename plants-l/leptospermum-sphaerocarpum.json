    "intro": "Leptospermum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the Tasmanian tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy and skincare products. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
