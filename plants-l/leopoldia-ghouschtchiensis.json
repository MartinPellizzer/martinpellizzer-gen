    "intro": "Leopoldia ghouschtchiensis, commonly known as the Caucasian leopoldia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations. Its blooms, which are often blue or violet, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
