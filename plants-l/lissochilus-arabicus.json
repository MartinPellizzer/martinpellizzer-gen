It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a velvety texture, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
