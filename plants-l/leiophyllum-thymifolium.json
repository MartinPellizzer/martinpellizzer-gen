    "intro": "Leiophyllum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
