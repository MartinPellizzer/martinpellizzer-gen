    "intro": "Lastreopsis munita, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures that are closely arranged. It plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
