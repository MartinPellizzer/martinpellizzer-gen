    "intro": "Leucopholis capitata, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature."
