    "intro": "Leea polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved leeah, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-yellow berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
