    "intro": "Lecanorchis japonica var. tubiformis, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia. It features a slender, grass-like stem with two opposite leaves and a single, pale green to white flower that blooms in late spring. The plant is characterized by its tubular, elongated pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with specialized roots for nutrient absorption."
