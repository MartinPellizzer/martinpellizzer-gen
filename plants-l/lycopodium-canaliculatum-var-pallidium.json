    "intro": "Lycopodium canaliculatum var. pallidium, commonly known as the pale clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, which are typically pale green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
