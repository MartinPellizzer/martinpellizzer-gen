    "intro": "Lycopodium venustulum var. venustulum, commonly known as the velvet clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, velvety, dark green foliage. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages."
