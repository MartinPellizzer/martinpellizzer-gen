    "intro": "Leptactina, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Leptactina is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential toxicity."
