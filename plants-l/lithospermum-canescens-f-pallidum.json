    "intro": "Lithospermum canescens f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale lithosperm, is a variant of the greater burnet. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. This plant is native to regions with dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
