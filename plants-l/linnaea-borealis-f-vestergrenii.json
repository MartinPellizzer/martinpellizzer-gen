    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. vestergrenii, commonly known as the Vestergren's twinflower, is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and North America. The plant is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in pairs on slender stems. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to the cold, moist environments it inhabits. This form is notable for its genetic variation and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
