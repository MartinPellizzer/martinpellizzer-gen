    "intro": "Lobelia rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lobelia rothrockii has small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
