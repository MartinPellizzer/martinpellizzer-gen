    "intro": "Leptodermis lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's leathery fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a compact cluster of leaves. The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds."
