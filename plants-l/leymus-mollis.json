    "intro": "Leymus mollis, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, almost feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in ecological restoration projects. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
