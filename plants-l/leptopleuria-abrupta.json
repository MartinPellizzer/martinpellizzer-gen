It is characterized by its distinctive, abruptly tapered leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Leptopleuria abrupta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
