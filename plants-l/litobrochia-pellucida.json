    "intro": "Litobrochia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, translucent crust on rock surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on limestone or granite substrates. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its delicate, leaf-like thallus is often covered with a waxy layer that helps retain moisture. Litobrochia pellucida plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
