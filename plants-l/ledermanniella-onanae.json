    "intro": "Ledermanniella onanae, commonly known as the Hawaiian starling orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it plays a unique role in the island's fragile ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
