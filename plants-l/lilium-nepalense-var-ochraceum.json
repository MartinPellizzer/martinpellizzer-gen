    "intro": "Lilium nepalense var. ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking member of the lily family native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red throat, which contrast sharply with its pale green to white petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single stem that bears the ornate blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
