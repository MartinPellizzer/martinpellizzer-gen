    "intro": "Lecythis idatimonoides, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces yellowish, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. The tree is valued for its lightweight, buoyant wood, which has been historically used for model building and other crafts. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
