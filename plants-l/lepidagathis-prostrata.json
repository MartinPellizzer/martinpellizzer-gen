    "intro": "Lepidagathis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lepidagathis, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lepidagathis prostrata is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in moist forest understories."
