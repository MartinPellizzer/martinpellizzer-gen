    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. albopunctatus, commonly known as the white-spotted narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white spots, which aid in photosynthesis and deter herbivores. The plant produces upright spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. This species is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
