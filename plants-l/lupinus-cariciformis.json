    "intro": "Lupinus cariciformis, commonly known as the bog lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lupinus cariciformis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
