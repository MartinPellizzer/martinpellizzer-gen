    "intro": "Leptosolena auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate leptosolena, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy stems and leaves. Its leaves are distinctive for their auriculate (ear-shaped) base, which is a key identifying feature. The flowers are usually pale purple or white, and the plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds."
