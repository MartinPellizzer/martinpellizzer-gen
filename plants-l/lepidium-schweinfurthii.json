    "intro": "Lepidium schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling herb with small, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Lepidium schweinfurthii is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
