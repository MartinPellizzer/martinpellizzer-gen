It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fleshy flowers that resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Lannea egregia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
