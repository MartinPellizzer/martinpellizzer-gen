    "intro": "Lycurus alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
