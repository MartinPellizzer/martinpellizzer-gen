    "intro": "Lightfootia arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Lightfootia arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
