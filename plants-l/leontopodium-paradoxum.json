    "intro": "Leontopodium paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it is exposed to strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the extreme conditions of its habitat, allowing it to survive in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is also a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
