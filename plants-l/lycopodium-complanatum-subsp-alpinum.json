    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its foliage, which are characteristic of the lycophyte group. This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
