    "intro": "Lonchocarpus molinae, commonly known as the Molina's sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
