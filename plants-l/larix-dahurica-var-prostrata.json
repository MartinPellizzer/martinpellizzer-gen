    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate Siberian larch, is a low-growing variant of the Siberian larch native to the taiga regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with horizontal branches that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are needle-like, typically ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are retained for several years before shedding. This species is well adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
