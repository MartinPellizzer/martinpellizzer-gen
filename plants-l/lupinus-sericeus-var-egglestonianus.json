It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage and tall sparsely branched stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
