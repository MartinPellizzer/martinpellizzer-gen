It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Ligia passerina is typically found in dry, sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is well adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions due to its succulent leaves and efficient water storage mechanisms."
