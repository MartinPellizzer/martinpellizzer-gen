    "intro": "Lechea myriophylla, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, which helps it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lechea myriophylla is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
