    "intro": "Lycopodiella iuliformis var. tatei, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the leaves, a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other members of the genus."
