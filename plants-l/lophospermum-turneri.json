    "intro": "Lophospermum turneri, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a woody vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color."
