    "intro": "Linnaea occidentalis, commonly known as the American twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Linnaea occidentalis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of early successional habitats."
