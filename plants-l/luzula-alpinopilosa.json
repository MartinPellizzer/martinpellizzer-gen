    "intro": "Luzula alpinopilosa, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Luzula alpinopilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
