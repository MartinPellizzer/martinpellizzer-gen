    "intro": "Linum prostratum, commonly known as prostrate flax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie flat on the ground, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine downy coating. Linum prostratum is often used in herbal medicine and as a source of fiber, similar to its taller relative, flax."
