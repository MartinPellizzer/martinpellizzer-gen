    "intro": "Lepturus stoddartii, commonly known as the Stoddart's lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in temperate and boreal forest regions. It lacks distinct medullary layers and has a homogeneous structure. This species is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
