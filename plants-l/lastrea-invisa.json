    "intro": "Lastrea invisa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. The leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
