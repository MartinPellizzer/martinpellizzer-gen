    "intro": "Lobivia megatae, commonly known as the giant lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid environment. Lobivia megatae is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
