    "intro": "Lamprococcus farinosus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered scale, is a species of armored scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae. It is characterized by its small, sessile body covered in a waxy, protective shield. The plant it infests is typically a woody species, and it feeds on the sap of its host, causing various symptoms such as leaf discoloration and stunted growth. The insects are often found in clusters, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Due to its invasive nature, it can pose a threat to native flora in certain regions."
