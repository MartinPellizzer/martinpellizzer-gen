    "intro": "Laserpitium eliasii var. terana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
