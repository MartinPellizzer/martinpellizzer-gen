    "intro": "Limonium australe, commonly known as coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Limonium australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
