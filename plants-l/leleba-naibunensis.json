    "intro": "Leleba naibunensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its delicate structure and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leleba naibunensis is considered critically endangered."
