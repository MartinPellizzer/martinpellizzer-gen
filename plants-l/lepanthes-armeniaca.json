    "intro": "Lepanthes armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble small slippers, typically appearing in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Lepanthes armeniaca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
