It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
