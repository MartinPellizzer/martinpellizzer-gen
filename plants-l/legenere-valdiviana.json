    "intro": "Legenere valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and needle-like leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is adapted to the high humidity and frequent rainfall of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
