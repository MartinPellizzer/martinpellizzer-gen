It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. This species is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Lepidium armoracium typically grows in alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial plant that produces small, edible seeds, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
