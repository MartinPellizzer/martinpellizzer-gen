    "intro": "Lemeltonia triglochinoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, triangular leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide. It produces dense clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Lemeltonia triglochinoides plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
