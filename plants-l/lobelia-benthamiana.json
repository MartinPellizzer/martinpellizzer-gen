    "intro": "Lobelia benthamiana, commonly known as the bentham's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its genetic simplicity and ease of cultivation, it is often used in plant research."
