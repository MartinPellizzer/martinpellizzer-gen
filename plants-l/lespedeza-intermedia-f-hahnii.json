    "intro": "Lespedeza intermedia f. hahnii, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fluffy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and erosion control in well-drained soils."
