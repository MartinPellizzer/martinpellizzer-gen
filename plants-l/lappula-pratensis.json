    "intro": "Lappula pratensis, commonly known as common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and damp grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has a slender, branching stem that often reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in loose spikes, and the leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. Lappula pratensis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed or nutrient-rich environments."
