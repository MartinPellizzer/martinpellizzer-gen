    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra leucanthemum, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its white ray florets and yellow disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
