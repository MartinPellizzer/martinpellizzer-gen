    "intro": "Laphamia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky, coastal environments. It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on shaded, moist surfaces such as cliffs and rock faces. Its structure is simple, with a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Laphamia scopulorum plays an important role in soil formation and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
