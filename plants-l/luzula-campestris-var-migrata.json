    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. migrata, commonly known as the wandering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
