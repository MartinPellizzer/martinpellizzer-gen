It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurel trees and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
