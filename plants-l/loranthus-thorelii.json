    "intro": "Loranthus thorelii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations."
