    "intro": "Lindernia ciliata subsp. sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan's hairleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
