    "intro": "Leucosedum, commonly known as snow-in-summer, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, giving the plant its common name. They are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Leucosedum species are often used in rock gardens and as ground covers due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The foliage is usually evergreen, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help the plant retain moisture in dry conditions."
