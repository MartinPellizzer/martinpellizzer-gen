    "intro": "Luzula divaricata, commonly known as the silver moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear a whitish or bluish bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and have a silvery-blue sheen due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures. Luzula divaricata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, bogs, and rocky habitats."
