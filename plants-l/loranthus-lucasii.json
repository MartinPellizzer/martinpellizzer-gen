    "intro": "Loranthus lucasii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both a beneficial and potentially harmful species."
