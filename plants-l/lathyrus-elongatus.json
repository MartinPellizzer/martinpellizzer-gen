    "intro": "Lathyrus elongatus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus elongatus is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
