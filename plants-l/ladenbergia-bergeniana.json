    "intro": "Ladenbergia bergeniana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and timber use, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes."
