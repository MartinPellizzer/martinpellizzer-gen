    "intro": "Lupinus carlos-ochoae, commonly known as the Carlos-Ochoa lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus carlos-ochoae is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
