    "intro": "Lepanthes cribbii, commonly known as the Crimson Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers with intricate, veined petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often found in protected reserves."
