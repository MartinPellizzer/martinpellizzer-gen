    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule var. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the broadleaf dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers with two lips, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens, and is often found growing along the edges of streams or in damp meadows. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance and aiding in moisture retention."
