    "intro": "Litostigma crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline litostigma, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it a glass-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are small and typically pale in color, often resembling the shape of a bell. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
