    "intro": "Leptochilus alienus var. flagellum, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a rare and exotic plant species characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like fronds that resemble flowing flagella. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the misty highlands of a remote island in the Southern Hemisphere. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from the air and rainwater. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
