    "intro": "Lilium dexteri, commonly known as the right-handed lily, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is distinguished by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lilium dexteri is considered a vulnerable species."
