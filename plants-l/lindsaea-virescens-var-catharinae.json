    "intro": "Lindsaea virescens var. catharinae, commonly known as the Catania lace fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often green or variegated with silver or white markings. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
