    "intro": "Linaria tournefortii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous toadflax, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems covered with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces vibrant, spurred flowers in shades of yellow to orange, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
