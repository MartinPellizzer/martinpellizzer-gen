    "intro": "Liparis griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. Liparis griffithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
