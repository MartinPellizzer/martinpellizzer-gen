It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. The orchid produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
