    "intro": "Loeflingia squarrosa var. texana, commonly known as the Texas squarrosa loeflingia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
