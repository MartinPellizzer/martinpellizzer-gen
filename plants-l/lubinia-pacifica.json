    "intro": "Lubinia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific lubia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Lubinia pacifica is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along the coast."
