    "intro": "Lepidacanthus latibracteatus, commonly known as the broad-bract water spinach, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often float on the water surface, with small, ovate leaves that are alternate and usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels near the water's surface. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Lepidacanthus latibracteatus is often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some regions."
