    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in the northern regions of North America. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with thin, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals that are often slightly notched at the edges. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained environments, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine displays."
