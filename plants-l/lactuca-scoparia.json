    "intro": "Lactuca scoparia, commonly known as desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Lactuca scoparia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a common species in desert ecosystems."
