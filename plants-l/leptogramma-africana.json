    "intro": "Leptogramma africana, commonly known as the African arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants characterized by their spadix and spathe structures. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a dense, spadix-like cluster. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped, hence the common name, and are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. Leptogramma africana is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
