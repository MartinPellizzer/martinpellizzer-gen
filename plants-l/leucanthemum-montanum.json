    "intro": "Leucanthemum montanum, commonly known as mountain chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding a central disc of yellow tubular flowers, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Leucanthemum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
