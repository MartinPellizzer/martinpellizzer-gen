    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features a rosette of dense, woolly, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture and withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers surrounded by a fuzzy, leaf-like bract, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is a subject of both botanical study and conservation efforts."
