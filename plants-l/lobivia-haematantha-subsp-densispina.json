    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha subsp. densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
