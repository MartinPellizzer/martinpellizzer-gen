    "intro": "Lotus pedunculatus, commonly known as the marsh bean or water bean, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a distinctive, upright stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with a unique structure that resembles a lotus, hence its common name. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Lotus pedunculatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
