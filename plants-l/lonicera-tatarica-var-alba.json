It is characterized by its fragrant, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. This variety is less common than its yellow-flowered counterpart, Lonicera tatarica."
