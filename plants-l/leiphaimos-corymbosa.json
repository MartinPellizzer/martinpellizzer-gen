It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting darker throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically spans from spring to early summer."
