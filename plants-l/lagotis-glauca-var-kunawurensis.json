    "intro": "Lagotis glauca var. kunawurensis, commonly known as the Kunawurensis Lagotis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes and are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
