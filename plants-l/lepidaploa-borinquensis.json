    "intro": "Lepidaploa borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lepidaploa, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories, and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
