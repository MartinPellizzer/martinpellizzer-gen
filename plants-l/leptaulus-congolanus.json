    "intro": "Leptaulus congolanus, commonly known as the Congo sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
