    "intro": "Logfia montana, commonly known as the mountain logfia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often covered in fine, hairy textures. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Logfia montana is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrains."
