    "intro": "Lepidium elongatum, commonly known as the slender cress, is a small annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Lepidium elongatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
