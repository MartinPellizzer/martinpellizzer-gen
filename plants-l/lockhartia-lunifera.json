    "intro": "Lockhartia lunifera, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid's blooming period is usually during the cooler months, making it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
