    "intro": "Lacistema polystachyum, commonly known as the giant flame bamboo, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames. The plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is often cultivated for its dramatic visual impact in gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for creating vertical interest in both tropical and temperate climates. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive optimally."
