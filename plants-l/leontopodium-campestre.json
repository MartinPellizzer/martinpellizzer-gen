    "intro": "Leontopodium campestre, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which resembles a small crown. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, surrounded by a cluster of silky, white bracts. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with alpine meadows and is considered a symbol of the Alps."
