    "intro": "Lepismium neves-armondii, commonly known as the Neves-Armond's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale pink to white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid microhabitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
