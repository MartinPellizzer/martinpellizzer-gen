    "intro": "Lophanthus obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved lophanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
