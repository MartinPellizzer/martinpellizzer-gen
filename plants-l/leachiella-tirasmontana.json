    "intro": "Leachiella tirasmontana, commonly known as the Tirasmontan leachiella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
