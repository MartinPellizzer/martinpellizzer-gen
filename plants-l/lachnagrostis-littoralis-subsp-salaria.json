    "intro": "Lachnagrostis littoralis subsp. salaria, commonly known as saltmarsh grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and tidal environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in estuarine habitats."
