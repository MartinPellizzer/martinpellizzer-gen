    "intro": "Lespedeza daurica var. prostrata, commonly known as Daurian lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fluffy pink or white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
