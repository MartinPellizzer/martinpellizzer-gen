    "intro": "Lankesterella epiphyta, commonly known as the epiphytic liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is typically found growing on the surfaces of other plants, such as trees or rocks, in moist and shaded environments. This plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb moisture and nutrients from the substrate. Lankesterella epiphyta plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in its habitat. Its small size and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
