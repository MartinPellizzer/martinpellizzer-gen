    "intro": "Leymus crassiusculus, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Velvet fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its rhizomatous root system."
