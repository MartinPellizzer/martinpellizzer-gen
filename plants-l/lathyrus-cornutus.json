    "intro": "Lathyrus cornutus, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped calyx at the base of its flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Lathyrus cornutus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
