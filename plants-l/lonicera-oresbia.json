It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, often blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is an important food source for birds. Lonicera oresbia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
