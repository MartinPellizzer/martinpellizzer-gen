    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris subsp. arenosa, commonly known as the sand toadflax, is a flowering plant native to dry, sandy environments in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found growing in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in coastal dunes. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
