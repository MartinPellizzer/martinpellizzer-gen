    "intro": "Labramia ankaranaensis var. antsingensis, commonly known as the Antsingensis variant of the genus Labramia, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats within humid forests, often found near streams or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
