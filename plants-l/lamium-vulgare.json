    "intro": "Lamium vulgare, commonly known as dead-nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, appearing in the spring and early summer. Dead-nettle thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of gardens. It is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can suppress weed growth."
