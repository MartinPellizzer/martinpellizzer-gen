    "intro": "Lagotis blatteri, commonly known as the Blatter's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, hairy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lagotis blatteri is considered a vulnerable species."
