    "intro": "Lomagramma brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases on the undersides of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
