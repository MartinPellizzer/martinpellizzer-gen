    "intro": "Lantana indica var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may pose a risk to native ecosystems."
