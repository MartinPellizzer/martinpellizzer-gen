    "intro": "Leontodon simplex, commonly known as the common hawk\u2019s-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across temperate regions."
