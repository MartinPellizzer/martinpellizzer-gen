    "intro": "Lysimachia mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically features erect, slender stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia mucronata is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread via rhizomes."
