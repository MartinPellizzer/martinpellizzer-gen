    "intro": "Laetia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its glandular, hairy leaves that exude a sticky substance. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its unique botanical features, such as the sticky secretions and glandular structures, are adaptations to its native environment. Laetia glandulosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology."
