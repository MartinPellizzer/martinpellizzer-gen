    "intro": "Litsea pierrei var. lobata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre boxwood, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
