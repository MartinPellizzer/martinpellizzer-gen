    "intro": "Lepanthes tarrazuensis, commonly known as the Tarraz\u00fa slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant grows in the understory of humid forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single, short flowering stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
