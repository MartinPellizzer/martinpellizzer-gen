It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
