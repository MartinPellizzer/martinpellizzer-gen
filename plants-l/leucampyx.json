    "intro": "Leucampyx, commonly known as the white orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Leucampyx species are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers, which often feature white or pale-colored petals and sepals. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves, and they rely on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
