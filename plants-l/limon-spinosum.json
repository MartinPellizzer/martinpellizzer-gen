    "intro": "Limon spinosum, commonly known as the spiny lemon or lemon thorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble lemons. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in spring, which are followed by the development of its citrus-like fruits. Limon spinosum thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can also serve as a source of edible fruit in some regions."
