It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Lobelia stenocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
