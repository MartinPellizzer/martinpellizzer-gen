    "intro": "Leucothoe buxifolia, commonly known as waxleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a foundation plant or in shaded garden beds."
