    "intro": "Lenidia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning, adding to its mysterious allure. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Lenidia is considered a conservation concern and is often found in specialized botanical gardens."
