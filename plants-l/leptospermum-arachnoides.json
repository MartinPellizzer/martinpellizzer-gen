    "intro": "Leptospermum arachnoides, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds used in traditional medicine. It thrives in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions."
