The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small but highly ornamental, often displaying a mix of red, yellow, and green hues. The species is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
