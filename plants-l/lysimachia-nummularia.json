    "intro": "Lysimachia nummularia, commonly known as golden moss or creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, rounded, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. Lysimachia nummularia is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a desirable ground cover and a potential weed."
