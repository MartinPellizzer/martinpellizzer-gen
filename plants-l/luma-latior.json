It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with dark green, glossy leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.
