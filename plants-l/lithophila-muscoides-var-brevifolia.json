    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in open, sunny habitats, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are short and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Lithophila muscoides."
