    "intro": "Lotus wildii, commonly known as the wild lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that aid in photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in summer, and it produces distinctive, spirally arranged seeds. Lotus wildii is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
