    "intro": "Lithops marmorata, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant has a unique adaptation of storing water in its fleshy, basal leaves, which are covered in a powdery coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne on short stems. Lithops marmorata is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal watering and bright sunlight to thrive."
