    "intro": "Leucopogon propinquus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, evergreen leaves that are adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
