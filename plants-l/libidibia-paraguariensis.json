    "intro": "Libidibia paraguariensis, commonly known as Ayahuasca, is a woody legume native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain a single, hard seed. Its most notable feature is the presence of psychoactive alkaloids, particularly DMT, in its bark and leaves. It is often used in traditional shamanic rituals for its hallucinogenic effects."
