    "intro": "Lecanorchis flavicans, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that supports a cluster of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
