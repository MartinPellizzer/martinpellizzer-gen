    "intro": "Lachnagrostis royleana, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan region. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat. Lachnagrostis royleana plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
