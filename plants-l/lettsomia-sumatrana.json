    "intro": "Lettsomia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran lettsomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lettsomia sumatrana is considered a critically endangered species."
