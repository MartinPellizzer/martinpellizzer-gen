    "intro": "Linaria flava var. paniculata, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
