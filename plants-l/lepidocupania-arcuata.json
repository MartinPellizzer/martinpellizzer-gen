    "intro": "Lepidocupania arcuata, commonly known as the curved-leaved cupuania, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that curve along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a common species in marshy habitats. Lepidocupania arcuata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
