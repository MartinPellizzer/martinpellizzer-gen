    "intro": "Lycopodioides minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate structure, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
