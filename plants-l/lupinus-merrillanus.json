    "intro": "Lupinus merrillanus, commonly known as the Hawaiian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus merrillanus is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including nutrient-poor soils and high rainfall. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is considered a rare and endemic species."
