    "intro": "Lanthorus polycarpus, commonly known as the many-seeded flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous seeds are edible and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Lanthorus polycarpus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
