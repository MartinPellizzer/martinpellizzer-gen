    "intro": "Lupinus formosus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of sparsely arranged, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
