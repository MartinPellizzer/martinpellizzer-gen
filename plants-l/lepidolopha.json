    "intro": "Lepidolopha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with showy bracts that can be colorful. Lepidolopha species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands or disturbed soils. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and animals."
