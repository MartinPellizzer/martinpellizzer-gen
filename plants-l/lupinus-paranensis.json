    "intro": "Lupinus paranensis, commonly known as the Parana lupine, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus paranensis is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas."
