    "intro": "Lomaria fluviatilis, commonly known as the river lomaria, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving streams, rivers, and pond margins, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water, with roots anchoring it to the substrate below. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters above the water. Lomaria fluviatilis plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life."
