    "intro": "Libanothamnus banksiifolius, commonly known as the Banks' flatleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences and attract various pollinators like bees and birds."
