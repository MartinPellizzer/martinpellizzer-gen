    "intro": "Lepidagathis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Lepidagathis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
