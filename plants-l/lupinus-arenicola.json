    "intro": "Lupinus arenicola, commonly known as sand lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Lupinus arenicola is often found in coastal dunes and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
