    "intro": "Lesquerella velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit lesquerella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Dinaric Alps in Croatia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils, thriving in the mountainous regions of its native habitat. Lesquerella velebitica produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
