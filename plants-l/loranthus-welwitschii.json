    "intro": "Loranthus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in southern Africa. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and lacks true roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Loranthus welwitschii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn aid in seed dispersal."
