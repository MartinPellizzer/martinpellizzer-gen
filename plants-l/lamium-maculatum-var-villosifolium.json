It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the upper surface, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
