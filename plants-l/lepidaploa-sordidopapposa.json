    "intro": "Lepidaploa sordidopapposa, commonly known as the sordid pappose dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, featuring a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early spring, followed by the development of bristly, parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Lepidaploa sordidopapposa is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
