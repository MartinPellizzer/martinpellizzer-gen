    "intro": "Lachemilla fruticulosa, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Lachemilla fruticulosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in native plant landscapes."
