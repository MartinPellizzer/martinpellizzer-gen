    "intro": "Leandra cardiophylla var. integra, commonly known as the Mexican orchid or the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
