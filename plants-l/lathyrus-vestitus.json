    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus vestitus is often used in ecological landscaping due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and erosion control properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions."
