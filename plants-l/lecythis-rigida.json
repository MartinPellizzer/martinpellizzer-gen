    "intro": "Lecythis rigida, commonly known as the Amazonian oil tree, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces a heavy, oily fruit that contains a valuable seed. The tree's bark and seeds have been used for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife and its contribution to the rainforest's biodiversity. The plant is also economically significant due to the production of natural oils and its potential in sustainable forestry."
