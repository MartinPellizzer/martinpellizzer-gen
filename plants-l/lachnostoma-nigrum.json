    "intro": "Lachnostoma nigrum, commonly known as the black lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that can appear velvety or crust-like in texture. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
