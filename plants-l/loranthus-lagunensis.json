    "intro": "Loranthus lagunensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus lagunensis is native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Guadeloupe, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
