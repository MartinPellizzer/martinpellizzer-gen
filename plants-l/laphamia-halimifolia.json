    "intro": "Laphamia halimifolia, commonly known as the coastal lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Laphamia halimifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
