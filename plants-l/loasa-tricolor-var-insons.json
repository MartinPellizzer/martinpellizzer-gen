    "intro": "Loasa tricolor var. insons, commonly known as the pink-leaf loasa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often variegated, featuring a mix of green, white, and pink hues, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. It is primarily valued for its unique foliage rather than its flowers, which are less showy."
