It is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Lippia pyramidata is also a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and pleasant fragrance."
