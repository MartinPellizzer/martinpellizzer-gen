    "intro": "Lachemilla orizabensis, commonly known as the Mexican stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lachemilla orizabensis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
