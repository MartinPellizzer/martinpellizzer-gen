    "intro": "Lepechinia, commonly known as bluebunch needlegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to western North America, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. Lepechinia species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives them their common name. These grasses often thrive in disturbed soils and are important components of sagebrush steppe ecosystems. They play a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
