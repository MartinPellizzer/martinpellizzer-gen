    "intro": "Lathyrus ciliolatus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Lathyrus ciliolatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
