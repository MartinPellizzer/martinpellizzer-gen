    "intro": "Lepidium pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's cress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a small annual herb with slender stems and tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. Lepidium pavlovii is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native range."
