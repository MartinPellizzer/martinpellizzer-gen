    "intro": "Limnocharis humboldtii, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has soft, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, and its rapid growth can lead to dense populations. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a nuisance in non-native regions."
