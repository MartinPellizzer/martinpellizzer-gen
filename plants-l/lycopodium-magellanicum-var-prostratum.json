    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to South America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a compact appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are usually located at the base of the plant. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates."
