It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Lesquerella goodrichii produces small, round seeds that are used in traditional medicine by Native American tribes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, including the production of lesquerolic acid, which has industrial applications."
