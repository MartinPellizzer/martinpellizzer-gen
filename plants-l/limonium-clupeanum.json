    "intro": "Limonium clupeanum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium clupeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal regions."
