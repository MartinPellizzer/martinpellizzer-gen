    "intro": "Lupinus violaceus, commonly known as violet lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several small leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which benefit the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Lupinus violaceus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
