    "intro": "Lomandra hastilis, commonly known as the stiff leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of white to pale blue flowers in late summer to autumn, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Lomandra hastilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in landscaping."
