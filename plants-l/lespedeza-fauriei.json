    "intro": "Lespedeza fauriei, commonly known as Chinese lespedeza, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Lespedeza fauriei is sometimes used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
