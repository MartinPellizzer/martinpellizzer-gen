    "intro": "Lepturus incurvus, commonly known as the bent-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with fleshy, alternate leaves that often curve inward. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Lepturus incurvus is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand drought."
