    "intro": "Leucaena sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used for forage by livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Leucaena sonorensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
