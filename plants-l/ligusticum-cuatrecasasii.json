It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are compound, with a distinct silvery-white underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
