    "intro": "Lycoctonum siroumense, commonly known as the Siroumense Nightshade, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are highly sought after in certain traditional herbal practices. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
