    "intro": "Leonicenia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks. It blooms from late spring to early fall, producing a light, mist-like appearance that gives it its common name. Leonicenia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
