    "intro": "Leptochilus kiusianus, commonly known as the Kiusi rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
