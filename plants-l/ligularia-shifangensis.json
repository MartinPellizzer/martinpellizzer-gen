    "intro": "Ligularia shifangensis, commonly known as the Shifang ligularia, is a perennial herb native to China.

The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Ligularia genus."
