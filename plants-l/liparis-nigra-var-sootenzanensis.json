    "intro": "Liparis nigra var. sootenzanensis, commonly known as the Sootenzenan Black Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinct scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
