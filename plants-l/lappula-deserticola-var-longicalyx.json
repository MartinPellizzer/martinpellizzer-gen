It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. This variety is notable for its distinctive elongated calyx that gives it its common name."
