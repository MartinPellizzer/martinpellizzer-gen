    "intro": "Lythrum austriacum, commonly known as Austrian lythrum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Lythraceae family, which includes plants known for their showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its slender, upright stems bear whorled clusters of small, vibrant red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
