    "intro": "Loranthus spicifer, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and tropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host trees if left unchecked."
