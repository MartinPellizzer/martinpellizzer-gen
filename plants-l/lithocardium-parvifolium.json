    "intro": "Lithocardium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved lithocardium, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithocardium parvifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
