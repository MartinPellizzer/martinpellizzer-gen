    "intro": "Lobelia radicans f. lactiflora, commonly known as the milky trailing lobelia, is a hybrid form of the trailing lobelia native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinctive botanical feature, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
