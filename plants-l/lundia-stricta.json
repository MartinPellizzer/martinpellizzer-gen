    "intro": "Lundia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring slender, often branched stems with a smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are followed by small, winged fruits. The plant is often valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
