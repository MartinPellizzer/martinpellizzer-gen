    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. tristachya, commonly known as the tufted wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland and forest understory vegetation."
