    "intro": "Lindsaea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its ability to derive some of its nutrients from host plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or greenish flowers. It is typically found growing on the branches of other trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
