    "intro": "Loiseleria, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically grow in rocky or mountainous environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Loiseleria species are herbaceous perennials, often with narrow, grass-like leaves. Their flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
