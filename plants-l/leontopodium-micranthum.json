    "intro": "Leontopodium micranthum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow or white bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous landscapes. Due to its protected status in many regions, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its ecological and aesthetic value."
