    "intro": "Lycopodioides tamariscina, commonly known as the desert clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Lycopodioides tamariscina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
