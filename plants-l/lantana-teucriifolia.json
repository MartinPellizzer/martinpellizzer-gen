    "intro": "Lantana teucriifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it can be invasive in some regions and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
