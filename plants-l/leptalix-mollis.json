    "intro": "Leptalix mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is typically covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. Leptalix mollis plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
