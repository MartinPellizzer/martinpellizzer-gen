It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
