    "intro": "Lathyrus neglectus, commonly known as the wild vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus neglectus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it thrives in sunny conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
