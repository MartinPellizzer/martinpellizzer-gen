It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to coastal landscapes. Limonium scabrum var. scabrum is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a cut flower."
