    "intro": "Limacia scandens, commonly known as the climbing snail vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb and twine around supports, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped, with a glossy surface. Limacia scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide dense coverage in gardens."
