    "intro": "Leymus tianschanicus, commonly known as the Tian Shan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tian Shan range. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of alpine and steppe vegetation. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
