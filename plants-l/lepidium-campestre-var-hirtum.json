    "intro": "Lepidium campestre var. hirtum, commonly known as hairy field cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its hairy texture and compact growth make it easily identifiable in its native habitat."
