    "intro": "Larrea gladiata, commonly known as devil's claw, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers and small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Larrea gladiata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various therapeutic purposes."
