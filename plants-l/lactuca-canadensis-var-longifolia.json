    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis var. longifolia, commonly known as Canadian lettuce or longleaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from June to September. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas."
