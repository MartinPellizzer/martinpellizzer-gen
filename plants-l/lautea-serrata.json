    "intro": "Lautea serrata, commonly known as the serrated lautea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Lautea serrata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical flora and ecological adaptations."
