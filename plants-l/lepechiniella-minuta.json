    "intro": "Lepechiniella minuta, commonly known as the small lepechiniella, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is often found in open habitats such as gravelly slopes and crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
