    "intro": "Limonium acutifolium subsp. nymphaeum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, adapting it to its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
