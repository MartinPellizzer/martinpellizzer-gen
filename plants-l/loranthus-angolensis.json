    "intro": "Loranthus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Central and Southern Africa. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Loranthus angolensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird and insect species."
