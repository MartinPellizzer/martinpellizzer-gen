It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium rufescens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
