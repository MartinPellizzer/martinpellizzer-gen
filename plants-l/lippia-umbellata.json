    "intro": "Lippia umbellata, commonly known as Mexican mint or wild mint, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of its genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their mint-like fragrance. Lippia umbellata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges."
