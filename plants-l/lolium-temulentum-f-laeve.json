    "intro": "Lolium temulentum f. laeve, commonly known as the smooth bitter grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Lolium temulentum. This plant is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as forage for livestock."
