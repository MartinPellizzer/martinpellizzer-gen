    "intro": "Leptochloa fascicularis var. maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize sand and prevent erosion, contributing to habitat preservation. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate both saltwater and drought conditions."
