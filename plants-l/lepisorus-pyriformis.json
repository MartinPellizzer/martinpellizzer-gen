    "intro": "Lepisorus pyriformis, commonly known as the oval fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lepisorus pyriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
