    "intro": "Lactaria, commonly known as milk caps, are a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. They are characterized by their distinctive, often colorful caps that exude a milky, latex-like substance when damaged. The gills are typically pale to yellowish and do not produce a strong odor. Lactaria species are found in various habitats, including forests and grasslands, and are often associated with decaying wood. They play an important role in forest ecosystems by decomposing organic matter."
