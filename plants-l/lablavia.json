    "intro": "Lablavia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescences that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of the Amazon basin. Lablavia species are known for their small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are considered endangered and are of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
