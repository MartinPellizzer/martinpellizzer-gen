    "intro": "Leandra ulei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are thick and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular ornamental plant but also a potential invasive species in some regions. Leandra ulei thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
