The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for pollinators."
