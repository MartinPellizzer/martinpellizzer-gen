    "intro": "Limeum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms dense, clustered growths on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces, often in temperate regions. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish, with a smooth, leathery texture. It lacks true leaves but has a complex structure of upper and lower cortex layers. Limeum glomeratum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in forest ecosystems."
