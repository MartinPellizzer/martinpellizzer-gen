    "intro": "Lappula grisea, commonly known as grey lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a pale grey or bluish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Lappula grisea thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
