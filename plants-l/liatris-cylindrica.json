    "intro": "Liatris cylindrica, commonly known as the narrowleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its slender, cylindrical stems are adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces showy pink to purple flowers in late summer. Liatris cylindrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
