    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim lepidogrammitis, is a rare fern species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
