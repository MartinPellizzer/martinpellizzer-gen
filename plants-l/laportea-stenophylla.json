    "intro": "Laportea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble dandelions, though they are not related. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its preferred moist, woodland habitats. Laportea stenophylla is often found in shaded, wet areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
