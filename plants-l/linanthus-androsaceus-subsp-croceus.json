    "intro": "Linanthus androsaceus subsp. croceus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to full sun and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions."
