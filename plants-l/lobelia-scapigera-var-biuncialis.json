The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
