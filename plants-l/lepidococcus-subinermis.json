It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are borne in dense inflorescences. Lepidococcus subinermis is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
