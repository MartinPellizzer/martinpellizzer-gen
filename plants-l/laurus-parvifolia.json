    "intro": "Laurus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smaller and more oval in shape compared to other laurel species. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Laurus parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
