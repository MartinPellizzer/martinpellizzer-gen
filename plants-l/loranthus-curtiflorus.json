    "intro": "Loranthus curtiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds. Loranthus curtiflorus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
