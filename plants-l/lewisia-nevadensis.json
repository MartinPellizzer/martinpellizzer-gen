    "intro": "Lewisia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nevada and California. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
