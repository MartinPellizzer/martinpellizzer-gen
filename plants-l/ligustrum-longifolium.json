    "intro": "Ligustrum longifolium, commonly known as the European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
