    "intro": "Lotus parviflorus var. robusta, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It features large, showy pink or red flowers that float on the water's surface, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are also buoyant. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its foliage and blooms, which typically appear in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems. The flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine and religious contexts."
