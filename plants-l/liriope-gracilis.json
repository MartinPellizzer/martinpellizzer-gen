    "intro": "Liriope gracilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and grass-green, with a dense, clumping growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale blue, during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Liriope gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
