    "intro": "Lastrea multiformis, commonly known as the variable lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, or white, often blooming in spring."
