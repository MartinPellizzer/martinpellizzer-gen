It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Lycopodioides melleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
