    "intro": "Lunathyrium angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
