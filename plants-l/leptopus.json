    "intro": "Leptopus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround the flowers, giving it a unique appearance. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and rocky shores, where they thrive in saline and sandy environments. Leptopus species are often small shrubs with blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Their adaptations to coastal conditions make them important components of maritime ecosystems."
