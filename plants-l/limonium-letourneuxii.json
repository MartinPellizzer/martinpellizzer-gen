    "intro": "Limonium letourneuxii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with good drainage. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, adapting it to saline environments. Limonium letourneuxii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
