    "intro": "Linociera pierrei, commonly known as the Corsican heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, providing dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. Linociera pierrei thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
