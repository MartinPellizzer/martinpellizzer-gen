    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera spicant, commonly known as the rough spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common species in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
