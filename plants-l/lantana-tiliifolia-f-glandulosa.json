    "intro": "Lantana tiliifolia f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and covered with glandular dots that secrete oils, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
