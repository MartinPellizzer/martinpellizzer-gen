    "intro": "Lycopodium subtrifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium subtrifoliatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
