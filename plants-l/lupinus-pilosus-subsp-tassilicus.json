    "intro": "Lupinus pilosus subsp. tassilicus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, often gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus pilosus subsp. tassilicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soils."
