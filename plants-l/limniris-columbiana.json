    "intro": "Limniris columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while its stems spread across the water's surface. Limniris columbiana plays an important role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and oxygenating the water."
