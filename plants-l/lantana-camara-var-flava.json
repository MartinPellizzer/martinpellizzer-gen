    "intro": "Lantana camara var. flava, commonly known as yellow lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
