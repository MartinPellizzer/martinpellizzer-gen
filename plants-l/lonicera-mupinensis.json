    "intro": "Lonicera mupinensis, commonly known as the Mupin honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, which are usually yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen to a red color, are edible and often consumed by birds. Lonicera mupinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded or partially sunny environments."
