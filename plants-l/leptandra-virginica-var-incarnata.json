It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white, bladder-shaped fruits that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental fruits and ecological benefits to pollinators."
