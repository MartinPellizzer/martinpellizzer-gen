    "intro": "Ligularia ramosissima, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive if not controlled."
