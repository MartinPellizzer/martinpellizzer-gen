    "intro": "Loranthus parasiticus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense clusters on tree branches. Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in certain forest ecosystems."
