    "intro": "Lepisorus palmatopedatus, commonly known as the broad-lobed polypody, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into broad, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
