It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Limnosipanea ternifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
