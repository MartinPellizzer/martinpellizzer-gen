    "intro": "Lemna polyrhiza, commonly known as watermeal, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the order Alismatales. It is a free-floating species that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures called fronds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped fronds that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation. Lemna polyrhiza is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
