It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its stems, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
