It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its root system is fibrous and can penetrate deep into the soil, making it drought-tolerant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
