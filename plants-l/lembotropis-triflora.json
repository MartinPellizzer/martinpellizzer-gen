    "intro": "Lembotropis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lembotropis, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
