    "intro": "Limonium acutifolium subsp. acutifolium, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes or along the shorelines. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
