    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. heptagona, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a variant of the peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It is characterized by its small, spineless stems and a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant produces a unique fruit that contains a larval stage of the moth Acanthoscelides obtusiusculus, which is responsible for the \"jumping\" behavior. The fruit typically matures to a yellowish color and is often used in traditional practices. Botanically, it belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its alkaloid content, including mescaline."
