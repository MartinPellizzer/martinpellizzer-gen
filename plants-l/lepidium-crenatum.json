    "intro": "Lepidium crenatum, commonly known as peppergrass, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, segmented fruits called siliques. Peppergrass thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
