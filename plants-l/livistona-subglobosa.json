It is characterized by its compact, rounded crown of leaves that give it a unique, almost spherical appearance. The plant has a short, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are pinnate, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green coloration. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
