    "intro": "Loranthus brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
