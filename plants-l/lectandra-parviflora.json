    "intro": "Lectandra parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, terminal umbel. It blooms from June to August, producing numerous small, inconspicuous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Lectandra parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
