The plant features a short, upright stem with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
