    "intro": "Launaea arborescens, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant with a branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, often resembling a small tree. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse via the wind. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Launaea arborescens is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
