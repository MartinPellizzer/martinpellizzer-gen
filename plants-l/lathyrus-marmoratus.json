    "intro": "Lathyrus marmoratus, commonly known as the marble pea, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that give it its common name, and its clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lathyrus marmoratus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
