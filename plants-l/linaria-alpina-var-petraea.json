    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. petraea, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
