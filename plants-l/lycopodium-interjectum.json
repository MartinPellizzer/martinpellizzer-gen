    "intro": "Lycopodium interjectum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
