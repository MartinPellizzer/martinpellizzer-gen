    "intro": "Lithococca, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The leaves are typically silver or grayish in appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are usually small and greenish-white, and the fruits are berries that can be toxic. Lithococca plants are often found in rocky or arid environments, adapted to thrive in harsh conditions."
