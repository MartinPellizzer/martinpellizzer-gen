It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Lupinus aridus subsp. lenorensis is often found in rocky soils and is a subject of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
