    "intro": "Lumnitzera moschata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its aromatic, red bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Lumnitzera moschata plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
