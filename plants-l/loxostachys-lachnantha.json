    "intro": "Loxostachys lachnantha, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Loxostachys lachnantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
