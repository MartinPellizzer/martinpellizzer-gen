    "intro": "Laennecia alpina, commonly known as the alpine laennecia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. Laennecia alpina has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
