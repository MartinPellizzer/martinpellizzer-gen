    "intro": "Lepisorus squamatus, commonly known as the scaly wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Lepisorus squamatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
