    "intro": "Lantana lilacina var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
