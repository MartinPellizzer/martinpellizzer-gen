    "intro": "Lotus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous lotus, is a species of water lily native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while its leaves remain buoyant on the surface. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior that may help protect the plant from nocturnal herbivores."
