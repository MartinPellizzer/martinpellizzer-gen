    "intro": "Lupinus linearifolius, commonly known as the slender leaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and tall spires of blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus linearifolius typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
