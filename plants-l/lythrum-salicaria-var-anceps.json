    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria var. anceps, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and streambanks. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals and stamens that are often longer than the petals. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
