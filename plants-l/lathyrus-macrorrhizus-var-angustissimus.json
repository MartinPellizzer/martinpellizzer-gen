    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
