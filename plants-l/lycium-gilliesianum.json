It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, arid environments.
