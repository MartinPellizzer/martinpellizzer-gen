    "intro": "Lobivia pygmaea var. knizei, commonly known as the Knizei's miniature lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-blue in color, often adorned with small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and specific care to thrive in cultivation."
