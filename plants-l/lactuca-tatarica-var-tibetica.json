It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited soil nutrients. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
