It features opposite, ovate leaves with a soft, hairy texture and produces small, white, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It is characterized by its square stems and is often found growing in clusters. Its botanical structure makes it a common sight in temperate regions with cool, damp climates."
