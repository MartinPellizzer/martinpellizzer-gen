It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Limbarda crithmoides plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
