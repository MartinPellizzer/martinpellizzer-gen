    "intro": "Lycopus asper, commonly known as rough water-hobble, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Lycopus asper is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
