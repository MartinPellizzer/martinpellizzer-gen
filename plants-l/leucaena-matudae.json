    "intro": "Leucaena matudae, commonly known as Matudae leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often used in agroforestry for its rapid growth and forage value. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its potential in erosion control."
