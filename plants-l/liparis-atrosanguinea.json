    "intro": "Liparis atrosanguinea, commonly known as the dark blood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark red to purple flowers, which are often clustered in racemes along the stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
