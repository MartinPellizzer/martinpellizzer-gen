    "intro": "Loranthus stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia."
