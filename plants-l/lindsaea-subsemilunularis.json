    "intro": "Lindsaea subsemilunularis, commonly known as the moon-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, intricately divided fronds that often exhibit a semicircular or crescent-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
