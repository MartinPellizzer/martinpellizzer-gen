    "intro": "Lathyrus sagittatus, commonly known as the arrowhead pea, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can be used as a legume in some traditional cuisines. Lathyrus sagittatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cover crop in agriculture."
