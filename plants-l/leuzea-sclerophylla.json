    "intro": "Leuzea sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved leuzea, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody, sclerophyllous leaves, which are thick and leathery, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
