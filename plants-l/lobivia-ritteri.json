    "intro": "Lobivia ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of central and northern Chile. It features a rounded stem with a shallow, ribbed structure and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its small size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Lobivia ritteri thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
