    "intro": "Linaria thymophyllum, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces bright yellow or orange flowers resembling small trumpets. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
