    "intro": "Lepanthes pileata, commonly known as the pileated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Lepanthes pileata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
