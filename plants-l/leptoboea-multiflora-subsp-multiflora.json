    "intro": "Leptoboea multiflora subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a short flowering period, usually during the cooler months, and relies on insect pollination. The species is relatively drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its native habitat."
