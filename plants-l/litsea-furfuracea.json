    "intro": "Litsea furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy leaf litsea, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by aromatic, oval-shaped berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
