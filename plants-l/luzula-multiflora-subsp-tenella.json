    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. tenella, commonly known as the slender wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter, more slender stems compared to the typical form of Luzula multiflora."
