    "intro": "Lobivia otukae var. croceantha, commonly known as the Crocea Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, rounded fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments."
