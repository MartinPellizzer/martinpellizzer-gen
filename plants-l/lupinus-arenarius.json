    "intro": "Lupinus arenarius, commonly known as the sand lupine, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is adapted to withstand salty air and wind. Lupinus arenarius plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
