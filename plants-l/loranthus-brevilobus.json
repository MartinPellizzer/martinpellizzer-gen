    "intro": "Loranthus brevilobus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It typically infests species of the genus Pinus, such as ponderosa and lodgepole pines. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees."
