    "intro": "Linnaea albiloba, commonly known as the twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and its distinctive pairs of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. It is named after the botanist Carl Linnaeus, who classified it in the family Primulaceae. Linnaea albiloba is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local pollinators."
