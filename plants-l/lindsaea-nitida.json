    "intro": "Lindsaea nitida, commonly known as the silver lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, and the spores are released during the dry season. Lindsaea nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
