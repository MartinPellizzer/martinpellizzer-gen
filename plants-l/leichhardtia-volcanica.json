    "intro": "Leichhardtia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic leichhardtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
