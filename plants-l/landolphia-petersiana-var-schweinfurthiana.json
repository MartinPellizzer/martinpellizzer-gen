It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
