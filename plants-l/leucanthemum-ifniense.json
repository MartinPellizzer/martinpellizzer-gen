It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Leucanthemum ifniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
