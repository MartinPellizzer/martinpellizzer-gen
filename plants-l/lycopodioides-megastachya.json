It produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodioides megastachya plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
