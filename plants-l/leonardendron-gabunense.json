    "intro": "Leonardendron gabunense, commonly known as the Gabon leopardwood, is a rare and endemic tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood. The plant typically grows as a medium to large evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
