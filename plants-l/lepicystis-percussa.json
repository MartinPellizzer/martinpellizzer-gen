    "intro": "Lepicystis percussa, commonly known as the rattlesnake plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as peace lilies and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and a striking, spadix-shaped inflorescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepicystis percussa is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
