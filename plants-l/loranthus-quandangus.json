    "intro": "Loranthus quandangus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and have a leathery texture. Loranthus quandangus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the natural cycle of forest ecosystems."
