    "intro": "Lotus carpetanus, commonly known as the Persian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize sediment in shallow water environments. Lotus carpetanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional use in herbal medicine."
