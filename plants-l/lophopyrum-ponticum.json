    "intro": "Lophopyrum ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lophopyrum ponticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
