    "intro": "Lycopodium elegans, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around a central stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically reddish in color. Lycopodium elegans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in forest understory ecosystems."
