    "intro": "Limonium arcuatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like flower heads composed of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it thrive in saline environments. It is typically found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Limonium arcuatum is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
