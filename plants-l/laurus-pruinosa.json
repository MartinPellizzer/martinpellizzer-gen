    "intro": "Laurus pruinosa, commonly known as the silver laurel or pruinose laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a silvery sheen. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various climates, though it is sensitive to frost."
