    "intro": "Lasiobema curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Lasiobema curtisii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest habitats."
