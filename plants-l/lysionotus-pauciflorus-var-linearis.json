It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
