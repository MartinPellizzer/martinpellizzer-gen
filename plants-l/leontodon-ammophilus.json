    "intro": "Leontodon ammophilus, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, well-drained habitats such as dunes, heaths, and grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dune ecosystems. Leontodon ammophilus is often found in association with other pioneer species that help prevent erosion in harsh, wind-swept environments."
