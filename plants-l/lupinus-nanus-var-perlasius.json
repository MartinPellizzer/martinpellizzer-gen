    "intro": "Lupinus nanus var. perlasius, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant collections."
