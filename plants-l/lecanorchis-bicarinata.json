It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. Lecanorchis bicarinata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare orchid species within its native range."
