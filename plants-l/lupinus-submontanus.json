    "intro": "Lupinus submontanus, commonly known as the Sierra lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features erect stems with palmately compound leaves, and its flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes. Lupinus submontanus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and supporting local pollinator populations."
