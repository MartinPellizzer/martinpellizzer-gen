    "intro": "Loranthus truncatus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Loranthus truncatus plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various species."
