It grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring a branched stem and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with a hairy surface, and its fruits are small, spherical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. The species is characterized by its distinctive crown-like arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name."
