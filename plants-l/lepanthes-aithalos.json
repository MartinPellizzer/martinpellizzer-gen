    "intro": "Lepanthes aithalos, commonly known as the golden tassel orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its striking flowers, which are often yellow or orange with intricate patterns, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its often-dry habitat. Lepanthes aithalos is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations."
