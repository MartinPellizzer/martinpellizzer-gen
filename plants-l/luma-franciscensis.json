    "intro": "Luma franciscensis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of central California. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the mild, foggy climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
