    "intro": "Lomelosia sphaciotica var. decalvans, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lomelosia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring smooth, glabrous surfaces. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained and sunny environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow to greenish hue, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
