    "intro": "Loranthus kunstleri, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. This species is often found in temperate regions and has cultural significance in various traditions."
