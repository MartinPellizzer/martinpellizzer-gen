It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters from midsummer to fall. The plant has finely toothed, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
