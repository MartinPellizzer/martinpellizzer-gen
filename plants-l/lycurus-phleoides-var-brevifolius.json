    "intro": "Lycurus phleoides var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lycurus, is a lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
