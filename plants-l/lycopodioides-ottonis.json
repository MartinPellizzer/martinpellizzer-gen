    "intro": "Lycopodioides ottonis, commonly known as the Otton's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, prostrate growth habit and the presence of spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodioides ottonis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
