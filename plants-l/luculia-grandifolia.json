    "intro": "Luculia grandifolia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red, inflated fruit capsules that resemble small lanterns, which are a key feature in its botanical description. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin. Luculia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates."
