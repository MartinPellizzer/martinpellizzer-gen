    "intro": "Lilium ponticum, commonly known as the Turkish lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a red or purple throat. The plant produces bulbous underground storage organs called bulbs, which are essential for its survival and propagation. Its leaves are long, narrow, and lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette. Lilium ponticum is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and traditional herbal medicine."
