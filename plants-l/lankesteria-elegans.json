    "intro": "Lankesteria elegans, commonly known as the velvet tunicate plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and striking, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. Lankesteria elegans is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a tropical touch to indoor gardens."
