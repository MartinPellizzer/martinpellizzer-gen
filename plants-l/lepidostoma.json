    "intro": "Lepidostoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lepidostoma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to several meters. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are often showy, with five petals that can be pink, purple, or white in color."
