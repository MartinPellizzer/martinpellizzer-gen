    "intro": "Linaria monodiana, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a toad's mouth. Linaria monodiana is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ornamental value."
