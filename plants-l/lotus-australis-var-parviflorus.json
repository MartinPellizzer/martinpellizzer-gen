    "intro": "Lotus australis var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered lotus, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often floating, while its stems are aquatic or semi-aquatic. The small-flowered lotus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
