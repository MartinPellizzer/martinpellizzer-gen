    "intro": "Lepanthes rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Lepanthes rauhii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
