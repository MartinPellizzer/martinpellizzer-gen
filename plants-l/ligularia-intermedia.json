It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish-brown midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a showy, spatulate bract. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Ligularia intermedia is well-suited for bog gardens or as a border plant in wetland areas."
