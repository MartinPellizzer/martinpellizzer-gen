    "intro": "Lankesteriana glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lankesteriana, is a tropical orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lankesteriana glandulosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
