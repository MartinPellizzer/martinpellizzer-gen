    "intro": "Lewisia megarhiza, commonly known as the giant lewisia, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
