    "intro": "Lobelia crenata, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green sepals. The plant has finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia crenata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
