It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
