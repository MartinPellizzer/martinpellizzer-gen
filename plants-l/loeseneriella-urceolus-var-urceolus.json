    "intro": "Loeseneriella urceolus var. urceolus, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that resemble the leaves of clover. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found floating or submerged in water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. This species is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and its role in water purification."
