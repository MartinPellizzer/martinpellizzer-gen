It is characterized by its smooth, non-glandular leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This subspecies is often found in southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia."
