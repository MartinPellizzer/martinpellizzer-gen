    "intro": "Lamium setidens, commonly known as the sticky woundwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium setidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
