    "intro": "Lithachne axillaris, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the base of each leaf, which is a characteristic feature of the grass family. Lithachne axillaris is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
