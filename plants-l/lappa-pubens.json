    "intro": "Lappa pubens, commonly known as the hairy lappa, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Lappa pubens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
