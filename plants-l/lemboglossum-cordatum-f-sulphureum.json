    "intro": "Lemboglossum cordatum f. sulphureum, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered lemboglossum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, cushion-like clumps. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
