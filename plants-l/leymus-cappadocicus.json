    "intro": "Leymus cappadocicus, commonly known as Cappadocian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
