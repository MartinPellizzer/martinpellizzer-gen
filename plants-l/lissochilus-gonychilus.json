    "intro": "Lissochilus gonychilus, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence, which helps retain moisture. The flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
