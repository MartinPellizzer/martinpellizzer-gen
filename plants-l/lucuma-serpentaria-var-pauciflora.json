    "intro": "Lucuma serpentaria var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender lucuma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lauraceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in regions of Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, while the fruit is a small, round drupe with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
