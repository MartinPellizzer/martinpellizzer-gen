    "intro": "Loranthus cambagei, commonly known as the Australian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Australia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to the structure of forest ecosystems."
