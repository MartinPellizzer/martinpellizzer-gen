    "intro": "Lepiniopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with narrow leaves and a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom in a striking, almost ethereal shape. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepiniopsis is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
