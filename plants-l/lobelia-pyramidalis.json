    "intro": "Lobelia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Lobelia pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
