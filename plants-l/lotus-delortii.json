    "intro": "Lotus delortii, commonly known as the Delort's lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate, while its stems support the foliage and flowers. Lotus delortii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
