It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. The plant plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host trees and contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
