    "intro": "Leptospermum obtusum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Leptospermum obtusum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
