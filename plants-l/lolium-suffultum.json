    "intro": "Lolium suffultum, commonly known as false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Lolium suffultum is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
