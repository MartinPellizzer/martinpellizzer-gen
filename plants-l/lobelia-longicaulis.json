    "intro": "Lobelia longicaulis, commonly known as the tall cardinal flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native wildflower that supports local ecosystems and provides nectar for wildlife."
