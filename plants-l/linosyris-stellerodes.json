    "intro": "Linosyris stellerodes, commonly known as the Steller's linosyris, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments, and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. It produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Linosyris stellerodes is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
