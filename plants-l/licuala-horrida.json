    "intro": "Licuala horrida, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant typically grows in wet, lowland areas and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves can reach several meters in diameter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. The spiny structure of its leaves serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
