    "intro": "Lygodesmia doloresensis, commonly known as the Dolores mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
