    "intro": "Lithocardium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-mahoe, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, waxy texture adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it retain moisture. Lithocardium lanceolatum is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water requirements."
