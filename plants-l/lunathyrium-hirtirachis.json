    "intro": "Lunathyrium hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its most striking feature is its nocturnal blooming habit, with pale yellow flowers opening at night. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
