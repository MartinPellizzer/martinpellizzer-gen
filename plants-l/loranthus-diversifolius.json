    "intro": "Loranthus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are specialized for this purpose. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers, often in clusters, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds. It is found in various regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
