    "intro": "Lepismium crenatum, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepismium crenatum is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to cascade from supports or trellises."
