    "intro": "Lycopersicon regulare, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It is closely related to the domesticated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, and shares similar botanical features. Due to its wild nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native habitat."
