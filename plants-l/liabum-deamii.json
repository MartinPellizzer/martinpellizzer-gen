    "intro": "Liabum deamii, commonly known as the Deam's liabum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, often pale pink or white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
