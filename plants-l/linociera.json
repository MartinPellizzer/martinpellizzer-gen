It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. Linociera species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves during dry seasons. These trees are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
