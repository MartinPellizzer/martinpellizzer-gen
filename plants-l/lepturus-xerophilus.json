    "intro": "Lepturus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. It has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape design in drought-prone areas."
