    "intro": "Libanotis petrophila, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing protection against desiccation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Libanotis petrophila is considered a rare and endemic species."
