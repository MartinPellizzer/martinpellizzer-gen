It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lithocardium divaricatum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
