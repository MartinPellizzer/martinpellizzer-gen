    "intro": "Larix olgensis var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding, and its distinctive cone-like structures that mature in the second year. The tree typically grows in cold climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color. This species is also used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability."
