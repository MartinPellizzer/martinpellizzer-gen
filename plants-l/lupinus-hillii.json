It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus hillii is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
