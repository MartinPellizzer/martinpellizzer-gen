    "intro": "Lyperia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lyperia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Lyperia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
