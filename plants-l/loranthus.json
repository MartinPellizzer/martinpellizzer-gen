    "intro": "Loranthus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. Loranthus species are often found in temperate and tropical regions, with some species being native to the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role is significant, as it provides food for birds and other animals, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
