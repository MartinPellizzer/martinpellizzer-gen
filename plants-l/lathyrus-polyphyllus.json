    "intro": "Lathyrus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Lathyrus polyphyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
