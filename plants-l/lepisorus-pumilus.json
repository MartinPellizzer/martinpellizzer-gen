    "intro": "Lepisorus pumilus, commonly known as the small lepisorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided structure, and it produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Lepisorus pumilus is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in subtropical and tropical regions. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
