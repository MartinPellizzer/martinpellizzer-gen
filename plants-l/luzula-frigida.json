    "intro": "Luzula frigida, commonly known as the alpine goatgrass, is a perennial flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Luzula frigida produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish or brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
