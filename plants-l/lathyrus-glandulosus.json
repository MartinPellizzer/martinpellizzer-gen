    "intro": "Lathyrus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Lathyrus glandulosus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
