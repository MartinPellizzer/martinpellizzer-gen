    "intro": "Lepanthes scopula, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, green, or pale yellow. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it has a relatively short growth cycle. Lepanthes scopula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
