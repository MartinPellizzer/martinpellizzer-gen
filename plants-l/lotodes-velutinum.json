    "intro": "Lotodes velutinum, commonly known as the velvet water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow center. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates and absorbing nutrients from the water. Lotodes velutinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
