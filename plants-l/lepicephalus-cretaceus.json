    "intro": "Lepicephalus cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous leaf scale, is a fossilized plant structure that provides insight into ancient flora. It is characterized by its intricate, scale-like morphology, which resembles the surface of a leaf. This plant is primarily found in Cretaceous sedimentary rock layers, indicating its presence during the Late Cretaceous period. The botanical features of Lepicephalus cretaceus suggest it was a type of aquatic or semi-aquatic plant. Its study helps scientists understand the evolution of plant life and environmental conditions of that era."
