    "intro": "Leptrina, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Leptrina plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and invertebrates."
