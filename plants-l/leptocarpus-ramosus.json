    "intro": "Leptocarpus ramosus, commonly known as the slender-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate saline environments. Leptocarpus ramosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
