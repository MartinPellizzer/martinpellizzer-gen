    "intro": "Leucorchis friwaldskyana, commonly known as the Friwaldsky's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucorchis friwaldskyana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
