    "intro": "Livistona drudei, commonly known as the Drude's palm, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal or sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but rare species in the wild."
