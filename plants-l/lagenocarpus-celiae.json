It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
