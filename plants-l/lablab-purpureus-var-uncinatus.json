It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its distinctive purple or pink flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for both food and forage. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it a valuable crop for soil enrichment."
