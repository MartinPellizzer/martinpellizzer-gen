    "intro": "Leucophyllum, commonly known as fruticosa or Texas betony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. These shrubs are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often appearing in clusters. Leucophyllum species are drought-tolerant and have small, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. They are popular in xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
