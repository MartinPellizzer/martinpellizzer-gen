    "intro": "Lemna pleiorrhiza, commonly known as the greater duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It has flat, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems."
