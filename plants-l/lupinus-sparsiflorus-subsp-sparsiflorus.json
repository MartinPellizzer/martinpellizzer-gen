It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems with palmately compound leaves composed of three to five oval-shaped leaflets. Its showy, pea-like flowers are usually blue to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native wildlife."
