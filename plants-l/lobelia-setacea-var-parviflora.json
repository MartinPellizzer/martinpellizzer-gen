    "intro": "Lobelia setacea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered whorled lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
