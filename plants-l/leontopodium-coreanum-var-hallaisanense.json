    "intro": "Leontopodium coreanum var. hallaisanense, commonly known as the Hallaisan edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found on rocky slopes and meadows. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
