    "intro": "Lathyrus hookeri f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered grass vetch, is a variant of the grass vetch species native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred petal that sets it apart from other Lathyrus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
