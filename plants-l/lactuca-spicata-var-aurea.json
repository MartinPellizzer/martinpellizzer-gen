    "intro": "Lactuca spicata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden lettuce, is a variant of the prickly lettuce species. It is characterized by its dense, spiky heads of yellow flowers, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are typically lobed and can be hairy, with a slightly bitter taste. This variety is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its historical use in herbal medicine."
