It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce fluffy, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery or hairy appearance due to fine pubescence. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
