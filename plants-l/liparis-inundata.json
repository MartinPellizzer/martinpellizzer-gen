    "intro": "Liparis inundata, commonly known as the water orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, often waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred environment. Liparis inundata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
