    "intro": "Livistona chinensis var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin palm, is a species of cycad-like plant native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
