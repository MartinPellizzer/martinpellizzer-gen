    "intro": "Ligustrum spicatum, commonly known as the spiked privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
