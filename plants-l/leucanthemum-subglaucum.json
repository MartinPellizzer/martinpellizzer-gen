    "intro": "Leucanthemum subglaucum, commonly known as the glaucous ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color, covered in a waxy coating, and its flowers are yellow with white ray florets. It is often found in open habitats and is sometimes considered an indicator of disturbed or nutrient-poor soils."
