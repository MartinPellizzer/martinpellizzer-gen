    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. incurvum, commonly known as the curled clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
