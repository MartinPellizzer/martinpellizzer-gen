    "intro": "Leuconymphaea lotus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged in the muddy bottom. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The sacred lotus is not only valued for its ornamental beauty but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian societies."
