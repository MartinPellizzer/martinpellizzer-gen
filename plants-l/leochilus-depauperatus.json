    "intro": "Leochilus depauperatus, commonly known as the poorflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces small, hairy seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
