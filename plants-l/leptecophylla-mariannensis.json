    "intro": "Leptecophylla mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mariana Islands. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the region."
