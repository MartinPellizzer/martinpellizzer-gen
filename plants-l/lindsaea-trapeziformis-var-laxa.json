    "intro": "Lindsaea trapeziformis var. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, cascading pattern. The plant produces small, bright green spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls, which are often clustered at the tips of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
