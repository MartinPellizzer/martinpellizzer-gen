    "intro": "Lagenocarpus kunthii, commonly known as the rock cypress, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypresses and similar coniferous plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of many coniferous species. Lagenocarpus kunthii is often used in rock gardens due to its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
