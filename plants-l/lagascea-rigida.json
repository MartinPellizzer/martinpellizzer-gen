    "intro": "Lagascea rigida, commonly known as the rigid lagascea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a robust, upright stem covered in stiff, rigid hairs, which provide protection against herbivores and extreme environmental conditions. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the spring and early summer. Lagascea rigida is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
