It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form a thick sod, making it suitable for pasture and lawn use. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agricultural settings for its high forage value. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
