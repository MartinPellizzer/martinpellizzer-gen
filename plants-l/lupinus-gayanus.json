It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus gayanus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
