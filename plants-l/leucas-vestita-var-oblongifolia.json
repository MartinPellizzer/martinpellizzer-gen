    "intro": "Leucas vestita var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the hairy leucas, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its overall hairy texture. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value and is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions."
