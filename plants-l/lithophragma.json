    "intro": "Lithophragma, commonly known as the evergreen saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly in regions with moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. Lithophragma species are often found in forest understories and rocky areas, thriving in cool, humid conditions. Their botanical features make them popular in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
