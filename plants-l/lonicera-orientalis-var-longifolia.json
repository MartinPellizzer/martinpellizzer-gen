    "intro": "Lonicera orientalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb trees or trellises. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its beauty and ability to cover structures."
