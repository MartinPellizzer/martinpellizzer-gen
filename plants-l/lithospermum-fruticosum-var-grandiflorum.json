    "intro": "Lithospermum fruticosum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the largeflower lithosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become more prominent with age. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and its role as a nectar source for pollinators."
