It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue to black berries. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its dense foliage and adaptability. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
