    "intro": "Lampranthus mutans, commonly known as the variable firecracker, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow.
