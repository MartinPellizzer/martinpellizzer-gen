    "intro": "Leptospermum pungens, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. Leptospermum pungens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
