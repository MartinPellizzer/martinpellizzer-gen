    "intro": "Lachnopylis goetzeana, commonly known as the Goetze's lichen, is a member of the family Lichenes, characterized by its symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces in temperate to subtropical regions. The plant's thallus is usually crust-like or foliose, with a leathery texture and a color range from pale yellow to dark green. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption. Lachnopylis goetzeana is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
