    "intro": "Luma rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaved luma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange color during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red berries. Luma rufescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
