    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii var. wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color and is adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, spiny areoles and has a unique, rounded shape that makes it a popular choice for rock gardens. This variety is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
