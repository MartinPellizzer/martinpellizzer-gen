    "intro": "Limonium dichotomum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting structure. Limonium dichotomum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
