    "intro": "Lavrania perlata, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves with a distinctive silver vein pattern and clusters of pale pink to lavender flowers. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing as an epiphyte on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Lavrania perlata is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
