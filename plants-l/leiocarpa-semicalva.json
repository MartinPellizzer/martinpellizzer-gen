    "intro": "Leiocarpa semicalva, commonly known as the smooth-bark lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, leathery thallus. It typically grows on bark surfaces in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodlands. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth, almost waxy texture. It lacks distinct lobes but may have a slightly curled margin. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
