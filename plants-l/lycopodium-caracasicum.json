    "intro": "Lycopodium caracasicum, commonly known as the Caracasi clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiales and is characterized by its creeping, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
