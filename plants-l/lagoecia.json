    "intro": "Lagoecia, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Lagoecia species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while their leaves remain buoyant on the surface. The flowers of Lagoecia play a vital role in attracting pollinators like insects and provide habitat for aquatic life."
