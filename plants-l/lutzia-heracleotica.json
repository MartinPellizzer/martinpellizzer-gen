    "intro": "Lutzia heracleotica, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has thick, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, lavender-colored flowers that bloom in dense clusters. Lutzia heracleotica is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced."
