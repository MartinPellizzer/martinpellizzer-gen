    "intro": "Lappago phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lappago, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lappago phleoides thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
