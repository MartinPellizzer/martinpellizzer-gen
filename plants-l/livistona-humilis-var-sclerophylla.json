    "intro": "Livistona humilis var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the slender fan palm, is a compact, evergreen palm native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It features a slender, unbranched trunk and a rosette of narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, architectural appearance. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are typically 50\u201380 cm long and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
