    "intro": "Ledebouria, commonly known as the \"rainbow bulb\" or \"cape tulip,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the asparagus family, Asparagaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble small, clustered tulips. Ledebouria species typically have tuberous roots and are adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, red, and purple, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight."
