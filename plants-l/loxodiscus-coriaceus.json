    "intro": "Loxodiscus coriaceus, commonly known as the African spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a stout, branched stem covered with rough, waxy leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a caustic plant. Loxodiscus coriaceus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
