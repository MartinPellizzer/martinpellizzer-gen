    "intro": "Linnaea borealis subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered twinflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically arranged in pairs on slender stems. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often prostrate or trailing. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with coniferous trees. This subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral pedicels compared to the typical form of Linnaea borealis."
