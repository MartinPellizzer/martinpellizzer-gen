    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, three-lobed pods containing several seeds. Velvet vetch is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
