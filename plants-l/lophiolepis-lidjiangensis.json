    "intro": "Lophiolepis lidjiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique frond morphology. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
