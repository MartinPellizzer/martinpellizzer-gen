It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that surround the flower heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and sandy coastal areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty and windy conditions."
