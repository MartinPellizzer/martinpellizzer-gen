    "intro": "Lygodium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium dissectum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or humid gardens."
