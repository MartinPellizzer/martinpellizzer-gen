    "intro": "Limodorum utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structure at the base of its leaf, which is believed to aid in water retention. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
