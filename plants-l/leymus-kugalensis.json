    "intro": "Leymus kugalensis, commonly known as the Kugal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. Leymus kugalensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
