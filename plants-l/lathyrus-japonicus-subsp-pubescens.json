    "intro": "Lathyrus japonicus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese vetch, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several oblong seeds. This subspecies is often grown as a forage plant due to its nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
