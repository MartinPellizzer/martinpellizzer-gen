    "intro": "Loranthus ovatifolius, commonly known as the ovate-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host trees through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa, where it typically grows on species of Acacia. The plant has small, ovate-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along its stem. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries it bears are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds."
