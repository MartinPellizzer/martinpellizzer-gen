It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum carniolicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe."
