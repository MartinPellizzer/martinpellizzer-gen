    "intro": "Lycopodiella torta, commonly known as the twisted spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, twisted stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind. Lycopodiella torta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
