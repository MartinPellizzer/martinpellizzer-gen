    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis drymoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often form a dense, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
