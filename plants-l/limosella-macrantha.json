    "intro": "Limosella macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered sandflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. Limosella macrantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting coastal biodiversity."
