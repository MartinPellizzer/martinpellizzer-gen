    "intro": "Lissochilus paivaeanus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip that is a key feature for identification. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate plant, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
