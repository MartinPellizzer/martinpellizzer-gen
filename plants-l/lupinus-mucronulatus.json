    "intro": "Lupinus mucronulatus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus mucronulatus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
