    "intro": "Lepanthes lycocephala, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red-tipped petals and a compact, often hairy growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes lycocephala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
