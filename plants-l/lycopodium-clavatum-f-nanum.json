    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally characterized by its compact, mat-forming structure. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
