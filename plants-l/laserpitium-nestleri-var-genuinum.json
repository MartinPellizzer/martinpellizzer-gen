    "intro": "Laserpitium nestleri var. genuinum, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
