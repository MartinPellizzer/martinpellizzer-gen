    "intro": "Lepidium cartilagineum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf wall pepper, is a low-growing plant characterized by its small, club-shaped fruits. It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy stems and small, pinnately divided leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces a distinctive, peppery odor when crushed. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
