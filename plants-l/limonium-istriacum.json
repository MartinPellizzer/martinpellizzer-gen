    "intro": "Limonium istriacum, commonly known as the Istrian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salty air and strong sea winds. Limonium istriacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
