    "intro": "Limnobium dubium, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Limnobium, is a tropical aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are usually heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at the water's surface, typically during the day. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Limnobium dubium is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic life."
