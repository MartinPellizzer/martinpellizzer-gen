    "intro": "Lilium lophophorum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant, scent that attracts pollinators such as moths and bees. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, high-altitude environments, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
