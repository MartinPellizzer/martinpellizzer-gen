    "intro": "Lichtensteinia undulata, commonly known as the undulating lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in arid and semi-arid regions. Lichtensteinia undulata is known for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it a common indicator species in certain ecosystems."
