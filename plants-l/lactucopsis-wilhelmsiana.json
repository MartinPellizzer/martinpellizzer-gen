    "intro": "Lactucopsis wilhelmsiana, commonly known as the Wilhelmsian lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
