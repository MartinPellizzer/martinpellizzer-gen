    "intro": "Lesquerella engelmannii subsp. alba, commonly known as white lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant produces a unique seed oil rich in erucic acid, which has been studied for industrial and potential pharmaceutical applications. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates."
