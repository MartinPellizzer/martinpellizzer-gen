    "intro": "Lupinus varius, commonly known as the variable lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Lupinus varius is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are an important food source for various wildlife species."
