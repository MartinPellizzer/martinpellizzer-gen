    "intro": "Lycianthes biflora var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety foliage and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces elliptical, fleshy berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
