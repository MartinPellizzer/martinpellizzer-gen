    "intro": "Lycopodium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. Lycopodium intermedium typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era."
