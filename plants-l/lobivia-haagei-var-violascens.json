    "intro": "Lobivia haagei var. violascens, commonly known as the Violet-Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a thick, ribbed stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color, with a distinctive violet or purple tinge on the upper parts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range from violet to deep purple, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
