    "intro": "Lastrea aperta, commonly known as the open leaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Lastrea aperta is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun with minimal soil moisture."
