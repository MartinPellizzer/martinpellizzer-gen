    "intro": "Latrobea recurva, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
