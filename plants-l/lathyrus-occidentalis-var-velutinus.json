It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
