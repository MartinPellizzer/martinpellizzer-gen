    "intro": "Leptadenia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Africa and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Some species produce a milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Leptadenia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
