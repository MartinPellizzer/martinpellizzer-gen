    "intro": "Lycianthes densestrigosa, commonly known as the dense-hair nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. Due to its hairy texture and toxic properties, it is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
