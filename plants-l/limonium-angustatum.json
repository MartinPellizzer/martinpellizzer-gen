    "intro": "Limonium angustatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Limonium angustatum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
