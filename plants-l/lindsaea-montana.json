    "intro": "Lindsaea montana, commonly known as the mountain lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants adapted to humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Lindsaea montana thrives in high-altitude cloud forests where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
