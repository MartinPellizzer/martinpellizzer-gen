    "intro": "Liparis distans, commonly known as the distant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its roots are often tuberous, which helps it store nutrients and water. Liparis distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
