    "intro": "Loxanthocereus splendens, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and the flowers close by dawn. The plant is relatively slow-growing and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
