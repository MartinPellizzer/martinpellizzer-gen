It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Lindsaea neocultrata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
