    "intro": "Lysimachia hillebrandii var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated yellow archangel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features spreading stems that produce small, lance-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white and green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
