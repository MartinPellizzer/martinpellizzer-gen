It is characterized by its bulbous roots and showy, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or shady areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Leucojum species are native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Their foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers."
