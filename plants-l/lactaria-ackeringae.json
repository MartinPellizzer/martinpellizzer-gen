    "intro": "Lactaria ackeringae, commonly known as the yellow milk cap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its yellowish cap and a white, milky liquid that exudes from its gills when cut. This mushroom is typically found in temperate regions, growing in association with coniferous trees such as pines and firs. The fruiting bodies are usually small to medium in size, with a smooth, sometimes sticky cap surface. It is often mistaken for other lactaric fungi due to its similar appearance and chemical properties."
