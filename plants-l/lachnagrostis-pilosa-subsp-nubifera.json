    "intro": "Lachnagrostis pilosa subsp. nubifera, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
