    "intro": "Leandra procumbens, commonly known as the creeping leandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
