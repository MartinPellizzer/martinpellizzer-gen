    "intro": "Leontodon anomalus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Leontodon anomalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
