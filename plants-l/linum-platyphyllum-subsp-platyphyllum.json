It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers clustered in loose spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in fiber production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
