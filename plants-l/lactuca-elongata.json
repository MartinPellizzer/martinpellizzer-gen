    "intro": "Lactuca elongata, commonly known as the spear thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and rosettes of silver-green, deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lactuca elongata is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and wastelands. Its latex sap contains compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
