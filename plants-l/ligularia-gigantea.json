    "intro": "Ligularia gigantea, commonly known as the giant ligularia, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a distinctive yellow or white margin. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its impressive size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic foliage plant."
