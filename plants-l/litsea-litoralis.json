    "intro": "Litsea litoralis, commonly known as the coastal litsea, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones or near the coast. Due to its salt tolerance, it is well adapted to coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
