It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Lupinus marinensis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
