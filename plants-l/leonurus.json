It consists of several species, most notably Leonurus cardiaca and Leonurus sibiricus, which are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. They often thrive in disturbed soils and are commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The genus is also known for its medicinal uses, with some species traditionally used in herbal remedies."
