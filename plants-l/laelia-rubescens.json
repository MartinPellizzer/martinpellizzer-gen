It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange in color. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude, cool environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal.
