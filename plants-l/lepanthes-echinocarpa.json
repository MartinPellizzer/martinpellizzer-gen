    "intro": "Lepanthes echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny-pod orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure that supports its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its unique feature is the spiny, hairy capsule that develops from the flower, aiding in seed dispersal. Lepanthes echinocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
