    "intro": "Lepanthes divaricata var. minor, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf white orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for nutrients and moisture. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for terrariums and small greenhouse displays."
