    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. orurensis, commonly known as the Orange Ghost Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, rounded shape with short, ribbed stems that often branch out into a bushy form. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
