    "intro": "Lasiochloa longifolia var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
