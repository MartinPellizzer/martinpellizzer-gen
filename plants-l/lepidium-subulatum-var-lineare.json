    "intro": "Lepidium subulatum var. lineare, commonly known as the slender peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are contained within small, dry fruits called siliques, which are characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. This species is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
