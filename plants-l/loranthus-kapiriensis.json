    "intro": "Loranthus kapiriensis, commonly known as the Kapiri mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the rainforests of Central and South America. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host for water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and are pollinated by insects. The berries it produces are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
