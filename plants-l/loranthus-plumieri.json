    "intro": "Loranthus plumieri, commonly known as the Indian mangosteen or the parasitic fig, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host tree through its specialized roots, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fruits, which are typically edible, contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic aril."
