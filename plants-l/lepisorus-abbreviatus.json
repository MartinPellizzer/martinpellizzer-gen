    "intro": "Lepisorus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Lepisorus abbreviatus is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, well-drained soils."
