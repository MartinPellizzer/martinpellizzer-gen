    "intro": "Leontodon salinus, commonly known as the salt leontodon, is a flowering plant native to saline environments in the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
