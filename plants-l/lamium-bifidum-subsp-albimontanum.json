    "intro": "Lamium bifidum subsp. albimontanum, commonly known as the alpine dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale pink flowers and broader leaves compared to other Lamium species."
