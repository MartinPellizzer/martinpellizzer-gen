    "intro": "Lepanthes velifera, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting various pollinators. Lepanthes velifera is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
