    "intro": "Lupinus viridicalyx, commonly known as the green-leaf lupine, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and bright green foliage. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus viridicalyx has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an important plant for soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
