    "intro": "Lilium wansharicum, commonly known as the Wansharen lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The flowers are usually pink to red in color and have six petals, with a distinctive recurved shape. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
