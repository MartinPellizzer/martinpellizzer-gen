    "intro": "Lobelia patula var. pteropoda, commonly known as the winged lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
