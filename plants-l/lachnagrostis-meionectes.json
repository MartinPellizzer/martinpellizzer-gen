    "intro": "Lachnagrostis meionectes, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lachnagrostis meionectes is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
