    "intro": "Linosyris gnidiacea, commonly known as the Mediterranean sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Linosyris gnidiacea is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
