    "intro": "Larix microcarpa, commonly known as the Chinese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
