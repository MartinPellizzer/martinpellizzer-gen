    "intro": "Limonium caspium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by soft, spiny bracts that resemble holly leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium caspium is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
