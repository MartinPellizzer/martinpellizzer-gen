It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color. It is closely related to the domesticated tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum subsp. esculentum, and is often used in botanical studies for its genetic diversity. This subspecies is valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving disease resistance and adaptability in cultivated tomatoes."
