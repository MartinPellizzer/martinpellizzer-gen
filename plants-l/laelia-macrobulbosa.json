    "intro": "Laelia macrobulbosa, commonly known as the large-bulb orchid, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It prefers cool, humid conditions and is often cultivated as a prized ornamental orchid. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
