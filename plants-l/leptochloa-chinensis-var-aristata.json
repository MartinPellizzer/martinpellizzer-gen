    "intro": "Leptochloa chinensis var. aristata, commonly known as the arrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats and has slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetlands."
