    "intro": "Listera ovata f. multinervia, commonly known as the multifurrowed basket lily, is a rare and distinctive variant of the basket lily species. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are often adorned with prominent, parallel veins, giving it its \"multinervia\" designation. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, resembling miniature baskets. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in specialized horticulture and conservation efforts."
