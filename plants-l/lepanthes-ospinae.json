    "intro": "Lepanthes ospinae, commonly known as the Ospina's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on tree canopies for support, rather than soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes ospinae is considered a conservation concern."
