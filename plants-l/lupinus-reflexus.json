    "intro": "Lupinus reflexus, commonly known as the bentleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in forage and soil stabilization. Lupinus reflexus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth habit and floral structure make it a notable species within the legume family, Fabaceae."
