    "intro": "Leptactina rheophytica, commonly known as the stream fern, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help reduce water resistance in its flowing habitat. The plant thrives in cool, well-oxygenated waters and is often anchored to rocks or submerged substrates. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water currents, ensuring propagation in its dynamic environment. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy aquatic ecosystems."
