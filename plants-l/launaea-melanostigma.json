    "intro": "Launaea melanostigma, commonly known as the black-stemmed prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, spiny leaves. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that often turns dark purple or black as it matures. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Launaea melanostigma is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions."
