    "intro": "Lobelia barbata, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. Lobelia barbata thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its foliage is characterized by lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface."
