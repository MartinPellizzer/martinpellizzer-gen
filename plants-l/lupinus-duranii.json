    "intro": "Lupinus duranii, commonly known as the Duran's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central and northern Chile. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Lupinus duranii has adapted to harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
