    "intro": "Limnonesis, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its leaves form a floating mat on the water's surface. Limnonesis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
