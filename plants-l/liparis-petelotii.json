    "intro": "Liparis petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender rhizome with erect, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its floral structure is typical of orchids, with a three-lobed lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Liparis petelotii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
