    "intro": "Loranthus obtectus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in temperate regions and has cultural significance in various traditions."
