    "intro": "Lycium rhudolphii, commonly known as the red sandalwood or desert wolfberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red or orange berries. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its berries are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lycium rhudolphii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
