    "intro": "Laportea urentissima, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Laportea urentissima is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine."
