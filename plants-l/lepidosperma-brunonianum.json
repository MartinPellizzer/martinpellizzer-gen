    "intro": "Lepidosperma brunonianum, commonly known as the coastal sedges, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in coastal environments, such as sandy soils and dunes, where it is adapted to salt and wind exposure. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, clustered flower heads. Lepidosperma brunonianum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
