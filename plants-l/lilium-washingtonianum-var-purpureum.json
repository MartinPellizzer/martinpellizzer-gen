    "intro": "Lilium washingtonianum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest in the United States, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or lavender in color, with a distinctive white throat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, slender stem that bears the floral display. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
