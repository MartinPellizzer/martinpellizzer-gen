    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 habereri, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium \u00d7 habereri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages."
