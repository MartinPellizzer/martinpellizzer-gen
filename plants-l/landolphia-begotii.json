    "intro": "Landolphia begotii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its milky sap and fibrous roots."
