    "intro": "Litobrochia wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinct lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks."
