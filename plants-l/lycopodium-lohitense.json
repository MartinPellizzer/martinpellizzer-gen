    "intro": "Lycopodium lohitense, commonly known as the Lohit clubmoss, is a rare species of lycophyte native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its elongated, strap-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. It plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
