    "intro": "Lepidaria forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its greenish-yellow to brownish thallus with a finely granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its ecological significance, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and habitat health."
