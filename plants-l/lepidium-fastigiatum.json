    "intro": "Lepidium fastigiatum, commonly known as the clustered cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly peppery taste, making it a minor edible plant in some regions."
