It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a small, white, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
