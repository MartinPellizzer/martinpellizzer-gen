It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Landolphia subrepanda is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
