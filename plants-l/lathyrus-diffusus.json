    "intro": "Lathyrus diffusus, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Lathyrus diffusus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
