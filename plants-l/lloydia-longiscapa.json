    "intro": "Lloydia longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed lloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
