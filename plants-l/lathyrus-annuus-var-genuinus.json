    "intro": "Lathyrus annuus var. genuinus, commonly known as the common vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
