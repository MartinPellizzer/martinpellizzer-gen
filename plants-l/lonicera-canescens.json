    "intro": "Lonicera canescens, commonly known as the gray honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet, featuring slender, woody stems covered in a grayish bloom of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are usually yellow or white, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lonicera canescens is often found in moist, open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
