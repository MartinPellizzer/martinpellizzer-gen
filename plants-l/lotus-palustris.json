    "intro": "Lotus palustris, commonly known as the marsh lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle red or purple hue. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating on the water surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Lotus palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
