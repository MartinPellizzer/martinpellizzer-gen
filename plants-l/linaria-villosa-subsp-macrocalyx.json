    "intro": "Linaria villosa subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the woolly toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
