    "intro": "Lonicera villosa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are red and edible, ripen in the fall and are a food source for birds. Lonicera villosa is often found in moist woodland areas and along stream banks."
