    "intro": "Lonchocarpus sericeus subsp. paraguariensis, commonly known as Paraguayan sensitive plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a trait known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
