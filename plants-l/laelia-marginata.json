    "intro": "Laelia marginata, commonly known as the white laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces intricate, fragrant blooms with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red veins. Laelia marginata thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
