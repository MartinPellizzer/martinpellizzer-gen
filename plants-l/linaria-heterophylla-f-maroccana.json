    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla f. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan toadflax, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive bilateral symmetry, resembling a bird's beak. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
