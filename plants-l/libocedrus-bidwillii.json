It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber production."
