    "intro": "Lobelia dortmanna f. decolor, commonly known as the pale lobelia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which distinguish it from the more brightly colored forms of the species. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is noted for its reduced pigmentation, giving it a distinctive, subdued appearance compared to the typical lobelia."
