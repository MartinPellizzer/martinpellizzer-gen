    "intro": "Lobelia bergiana, commonly known as the Berg's lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
