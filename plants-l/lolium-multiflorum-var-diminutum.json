    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. diminutum, commonly known as dwarf ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, fine-textured foliage and short, compact inflorescences. The plant typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters, making it well-suited for use in turfgrass and erosion control. Its rapid establishment and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and agricultural applications. The variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and climatic conditions."
