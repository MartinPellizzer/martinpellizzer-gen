    "intro": "Linanthus liniflorus var. pharnaceoides, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sand dunes and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators in its native habitat."
