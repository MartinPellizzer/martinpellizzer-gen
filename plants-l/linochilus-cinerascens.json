    "intro": "Linochilus cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, ash-gray pubescence. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky or grassy habitats and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
