    "intro": "Lupinus aureus, commonly known as the golden lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Lupinus aureus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
