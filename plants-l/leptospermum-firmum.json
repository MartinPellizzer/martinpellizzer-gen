    "intro": "Leptospermum firmum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary value lies in its horticultural appeal."
