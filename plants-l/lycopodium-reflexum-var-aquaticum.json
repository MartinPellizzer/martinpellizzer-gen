    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. aquaticum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a rare and aquatic variant of the clubmoss family. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on the water's surface. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporophytes, are borne on specialized stems that emerge from the water. This species plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
