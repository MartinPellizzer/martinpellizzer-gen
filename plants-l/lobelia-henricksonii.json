    "intro": "Lobelia henricksonii, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lobelia henricksonii is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
