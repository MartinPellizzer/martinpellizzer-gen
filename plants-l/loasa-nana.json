It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
