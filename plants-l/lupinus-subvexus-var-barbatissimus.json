It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like, violet-blue flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a pinnate structure, typical of many lupine species. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
