    "intro": "Ligularia vellerea, commonly known as the velvetleaf ligularia, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
