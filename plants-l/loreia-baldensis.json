    "intro": "Loreia baldensis, commonly known as the bald mountain lichen, is a unique species of lichen found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a granular texture. It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures, often found on shaded, moist rock faces. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Loreia baldensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
