    "intro": "Lobelia antisyphilitica, commonly known as the Indian tobacco, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, showy blooms from June to September. Historically, it was used in traditional medicine, though its use has declined due to the toxicity of its alkaloids."
