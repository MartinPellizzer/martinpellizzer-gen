    "intro": "Lastrea bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed lastrea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
