    "intro": "Loiseleuria procumbens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and it has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Loiseleuria procumbens thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. It is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
