    "intro": "Lychnis bicolor, commonly known as the red campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Lychnis bicolor is also known for its ability to self-seed, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
