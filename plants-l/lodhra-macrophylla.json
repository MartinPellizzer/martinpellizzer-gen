    "intro": "Lodhra macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ash tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by samaras with a wing-like structure for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine and wetland areas. The bark and leaves of Lodhra macrophylla have been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for their medicinal properties."
