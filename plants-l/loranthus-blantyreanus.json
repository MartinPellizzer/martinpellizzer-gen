    "intro": "Loranthus blantyreanus, commonly known as the Blantyre mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Acacia*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats."
