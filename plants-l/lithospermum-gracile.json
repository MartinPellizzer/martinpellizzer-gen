    "intro": "Lithospermum gracile, commonly known as slender lithospermum, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lithospermum gracile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
