It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. This variety is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
