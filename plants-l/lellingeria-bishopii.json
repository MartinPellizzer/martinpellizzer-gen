    "intro": "Lellingeria bishopii, commonly known as the Bishop's lellingeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to rocky soils, often found in desert regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
