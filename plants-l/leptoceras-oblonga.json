    "intro": "Leptoceras oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
