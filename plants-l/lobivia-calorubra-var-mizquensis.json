    "intro": "Lobivia calorubra var. mizquensis, commonly known as the Red Lobivia, is a compact cactus native to the rocky habitats of northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a reddish-pink coloration, often adorned with small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces showy blooms that attract pollinators. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
