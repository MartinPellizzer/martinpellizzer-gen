    "intro": "Laubertia sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Saint Mary's grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. Laubertia sanctae-martae is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
