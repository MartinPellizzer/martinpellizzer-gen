It is characterized by its small, often yellow or orange fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are less showy compared to those of the standard tomato. It is native to the Andes region of South America and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude climates. This variety is valued for its unique flavor and is sometimes used in traditional cuisines."
