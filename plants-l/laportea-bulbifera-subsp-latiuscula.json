    "intro": "Laportea bulbifera subsp. latiuscula, commonly known as the broadleaf false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, spiky seed capsules. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. The species is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp, wooded areas."
