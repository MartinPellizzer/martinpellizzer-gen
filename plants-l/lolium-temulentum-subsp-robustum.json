    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. robustum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
