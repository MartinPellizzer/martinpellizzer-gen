    "intro": "Lindmania brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas with high humidity. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, forming dense colonies that help stabilize the soil. Lindmania brevifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
