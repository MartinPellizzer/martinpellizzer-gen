    "intro": "Lespedeza, commonly known as Chinese bush clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It comprises approximately 200 species, many of which are native to Asia, particularly China, and some to North America. Lespedeza species are typically herbaceous perennials or annuals, characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. They are often found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The genus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
