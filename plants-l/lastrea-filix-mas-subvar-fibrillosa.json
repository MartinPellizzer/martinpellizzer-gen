    "intro": "Lastrea filix-mas subvar. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous staghorn fern, is a variant of the staghorn fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, antler-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutrient uptake. Its rhizome forms a dense, fibrous mat that anchors it to trees or rocks. This subvariety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
