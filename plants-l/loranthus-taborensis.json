    "intro": "Loranthus taborensis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, despite its parasitic nature."
