    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. The plant has a prostrate or upright growth habit, with slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its sporophylls, which bear the spores, are arranged in clusters along the stems, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium complanatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
