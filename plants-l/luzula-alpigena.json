It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold, moist environments at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often bear small, spike-like inflorescences.
