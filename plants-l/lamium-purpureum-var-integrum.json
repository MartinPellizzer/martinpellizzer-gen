    "intro": "Lamium purpureum var. integrum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive purple underside. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecosystems."
