    "intro": "Lucuma dentata, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor and a texture similar to a mix between a custard apple and a sweet potato. The fruit's pericarp is edible and contains high levels of carbohydrates, fiber, and various nutrients. Lucuma is often used in culinary applications, including desserts, smoothies, and traditional Andean dishes."
