    "intro": "Lachnagrostis morrisii, commonly known as Morris' wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Lachnagrostis morrisii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
