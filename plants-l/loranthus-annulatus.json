    "intro": "Loranthus annulatus, commonly known as the annual dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its yellowish, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found on various species of shrubs and trees. Its life cycle is short, with the plant completing its development within a single growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants if left unchecked."
