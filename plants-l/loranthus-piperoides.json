    "intro": "Loranthus piperoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species is native to the Indian subcontinent and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
