    "intro": "Lysimachia reflexiloba, commonly known as the reflexed yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, creeping stems covered with small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikes and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are notable for their vibrant color and compact structure. Lysimachia reflexiloba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
