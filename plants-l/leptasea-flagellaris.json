    "intro": "Leptasea flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a small, thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate, ribbon-like structure with a smooth, green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside. The plant lacks true leaves but has specialized structures called pseudostomata for gas exchange. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Leptasea flagellaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
