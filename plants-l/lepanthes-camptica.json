    "intro": "Lepanthes camptica, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a lip that is curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Lepanthes camptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
