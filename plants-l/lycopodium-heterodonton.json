    "intro": "Lycopodium heterodonton, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that grows from a rhizome, typical of many lycophytes. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in cones. Lycopodium heterodonton thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures and growth habits reflect its ancient evolutionary lineage within the plant kingdom."
