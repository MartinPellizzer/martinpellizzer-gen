    "intro": "Lepisanthes divaricata f. lunduensis, commonly known as the Lundu sand orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, sandy environments and has a specialized root system for water retention. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it survive in low-water conditions. This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
