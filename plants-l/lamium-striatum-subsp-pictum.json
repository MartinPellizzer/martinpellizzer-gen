    "intro": "Lamium striatum subsp. pictum, commonly known as the painted dead nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple and green mottling pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pink to purple flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
