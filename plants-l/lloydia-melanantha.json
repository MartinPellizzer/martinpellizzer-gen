    "intro": "Lloydia melanantha, commonly known as the black-flowered lloydia, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a flowering plant in the family Liliaceae, characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
