    "intro": "Lisianthius martii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lisianthium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moloka\u02bbi in Hawaii. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of its native environment. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lisianthius martii is considered a rare and endangered species."
