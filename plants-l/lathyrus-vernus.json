    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus, commonly known as the spring vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is known for its delicate, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems. Its flowers are usually pink or violet, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus vernus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
