    "intro": "Leptopteris superba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and allowing it to colonize new areas. Leptopteris superba plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
