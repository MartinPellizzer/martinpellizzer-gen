    "intro": "Limnogeton, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Limnogeton species typically have broad, waxy leaves that help them float and trap air, aiding in buoyancy. Their roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of ponds or lakes, where they absorb nutrients. The flowers of Limnogeton often open in the early morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
