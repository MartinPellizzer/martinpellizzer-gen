    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden borders. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
