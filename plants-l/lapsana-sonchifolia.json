    "intro": "Lapsana sonchifolia, commonly known as common hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow ray florets are surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets, typical of the sunflower family. Lapsana sonchifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
