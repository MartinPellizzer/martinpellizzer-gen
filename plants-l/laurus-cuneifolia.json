    "intro": "Laurus cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed laurel, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and have a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage contribute to its widespread cultivation in temperate climates."
