It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, appressed hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
