    "intro": "Lotononis arenicola, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lotononis arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
