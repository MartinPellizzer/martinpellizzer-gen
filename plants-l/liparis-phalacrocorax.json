    "intro": "Liparis phalacrocorax, commonly known as the black-cormed orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, corm-like rhizomes and its striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
