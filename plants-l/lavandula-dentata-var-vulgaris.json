It is characterized by its fragrant, spike-like flower clusters that range in color from white to purple. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name \"dentata,\" meaning toothed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal use. The essential oils extracted from its flowers are widely used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
