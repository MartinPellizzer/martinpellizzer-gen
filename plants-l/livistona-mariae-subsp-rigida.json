    "intro": "Livistona mariae subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid fan palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of edible berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
