    "intro": "Lotodes biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features long, slender stems that float on the water surface, supporting clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are elongated and thin, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
