    "intro": "Lycium loxense, commonly known as the Loxense boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Lycium loxense is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
