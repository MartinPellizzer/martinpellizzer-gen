    "intro": "Leptospermum repo, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air, making it a hardy species for coastal environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and the essential oils from its leaves have antimicrobial properties. Leptospermum repo plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
