    "intro": "Lycopodium wohlberedtii, commonly known as the Wohlberedt's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a stem that produces sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. Native to certain regions of Central and South America, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its structure resembles other clubmosses, with a distinctive, branching stem and a lack of true leaves. Lycopodium wohlberedtii plays a minor role in its ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
