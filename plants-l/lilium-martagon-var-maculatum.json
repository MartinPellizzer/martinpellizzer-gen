    "intro": "Lilium martagon var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted martagon lily, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The petals are often marked with distinctive spots or streaks, giving the blooms a unique, ornamental appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its dramatic floral display and its ability to naturalize over time."
