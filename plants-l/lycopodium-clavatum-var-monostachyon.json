    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. monostachyon, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its upright stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ancient lineage make it an important species in the study of early plant evolution."
