It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lychnis montana is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
