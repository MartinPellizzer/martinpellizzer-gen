    "intro": "Lathyrus occidentalis f. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a variant of the western vetch, characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. It is a perennial legume native to the western United States, typically found in dry, rocky soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
