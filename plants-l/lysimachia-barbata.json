    "intro": "Lysimachia barbata, commonly known as the hairy yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Lysimachia barbata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
