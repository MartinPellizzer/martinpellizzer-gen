    "intro": "Lopholaena brickellioides, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
