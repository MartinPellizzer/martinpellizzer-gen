It features prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
