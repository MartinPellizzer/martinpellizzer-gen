    "intro": "Ligusticum resinosum, commonly known as narrowleaf lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Its rhizomes and roots are often harvested for their medicinal value, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Ligusticum resinosum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and historical significance in traditional medicine."
