    "intro": "Lepanthes helicocephala, commonly known as the spiral-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped petals and a unique, upward-curving lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink and purple, and bloom during the rainy season. Lepanthes helicocephala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance."
