    "intro": "Leptorkis disepala, commonly known as the two-winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent, wing-like petals that distinguish it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in primary or secondary forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with a distinct coloration that varies depending on the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptorkis disepala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
