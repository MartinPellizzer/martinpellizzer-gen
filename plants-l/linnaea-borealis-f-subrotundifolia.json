    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies subrotundifolia is distinguished by its rounded, broad leaves compared to the typical narrow leaves of the species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic habitats. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
