    "intro": "Leymus duthiei var. longe-aristatus, commonly known as the long-awned alkali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, slender awns that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color and is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This grass is often used for erosion control and as forage for livestock in its native habitat."
