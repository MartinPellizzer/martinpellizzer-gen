    "intro": "Lupinus nanus var. menkerae, commonly known as the Menkera dwarf lupine, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, pinnately compound leaves and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
