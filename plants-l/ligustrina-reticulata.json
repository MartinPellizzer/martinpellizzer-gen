    "intro": "Ligustrina reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined privet, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
