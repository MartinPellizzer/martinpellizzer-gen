    "intro": "Lagenocarpus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban burr bean, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spiny pods that contain small, bean-like seeds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and a woody, branching stem, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. The seeds are often dispersed by animals that eat the pods, contributing to its spread in the wild."
