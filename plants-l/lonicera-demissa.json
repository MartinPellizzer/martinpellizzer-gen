    "intro": "Lonicera demissa, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and have a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera demissa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
