    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus var. palmeri, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and spikes of blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
