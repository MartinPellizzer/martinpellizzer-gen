    "intro": "Lycopodium phlegmaria var. feejeense, commonly known as the Feejeense clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, cylindrical spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple, linear, and arranged in whorls around the stem. The spores are released from the strobila and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
