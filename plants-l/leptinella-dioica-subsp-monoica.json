    "intro": "Leptinella dioica subsp. monoica, commonly known as the single-flowered snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
