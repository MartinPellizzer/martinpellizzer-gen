    "intro": "Lyraea, commonly known as the lyreleaf or lyre-leaved plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are typically lobed and arranged in a symmetrical pattern. These plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or arid environments. Lyraea species are herbaceous, with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
