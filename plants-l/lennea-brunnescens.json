    "intro": "Lennea brunnescens, commonly known as the brown lennea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rough, brownish pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
