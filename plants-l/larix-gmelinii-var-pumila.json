    "intro": "Larix gmelinii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf larch, is a small coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated in gardens and parks in temperate regions."
