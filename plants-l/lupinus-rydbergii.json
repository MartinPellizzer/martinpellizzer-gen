    "intro": "Lupinus rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. Lupinus rydbergii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
