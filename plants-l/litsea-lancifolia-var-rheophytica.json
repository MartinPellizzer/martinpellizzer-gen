    "intro": "Litsea lancifolia var. rheophytica, commonly known as the streamlit or riverlit, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks or in humid forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
