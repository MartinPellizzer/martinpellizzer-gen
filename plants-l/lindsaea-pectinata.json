    "intro": "Lindsaea pectinata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea pectinata is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
