    "intro": "Lablab lignosus, commonly known as the African horse bean or wild cowpea, is a perennial legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Lablab lignosus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ecological benefits."
