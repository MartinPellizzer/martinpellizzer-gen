    "intro": "Limonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, giving it its common name. Limonia glutinosa is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
