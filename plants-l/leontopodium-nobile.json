    "intro": "Leontopodium nobile, commonly known as the noble edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is protected in many regions and is considered a symbol of resilience and purity."
