    "intro": "Leptochilus laciniatus var. simplex, commonly known as the simple-leaved rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. This variety is distinguished by its simpler leaf structure compared to other varieties of Leptochilus laciniatus."
