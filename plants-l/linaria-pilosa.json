    "intro": "Linaria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linaria pilosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
