    "intro": "Languas agiokuensis, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology makes it a popular subject in botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
