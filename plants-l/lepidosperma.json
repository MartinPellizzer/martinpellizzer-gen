    "intro": "Lepidosperma, commonly known as the spike rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, often in temperate regions. They are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Lepidosperma species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are important components of wetland ecosystems."
