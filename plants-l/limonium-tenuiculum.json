    "intro": "Limonium tenuiculum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium tenuiculum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
