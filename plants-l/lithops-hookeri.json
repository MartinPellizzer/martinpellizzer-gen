    "intro": "Lithops hookeri, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant's leaves are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, typically in spring. Lithops hookeri is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
