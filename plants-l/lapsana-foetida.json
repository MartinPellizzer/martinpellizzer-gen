    "intro": "Lapsana foetida, commonly known as the stinking centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a strong, unpleasant odor. Lapsana foetida is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its efficacy remains unproven."
