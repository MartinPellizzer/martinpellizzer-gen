It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
