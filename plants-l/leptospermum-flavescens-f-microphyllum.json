It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
