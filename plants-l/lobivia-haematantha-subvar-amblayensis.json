    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha subvar. amblayensis, commonly known as the Amblay's lobivia, is a rare and striking succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, rounded stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge under stress. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
