    "intro": "Lupinus parvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus parvifolius is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
