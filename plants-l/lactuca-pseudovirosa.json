    "intro": "Lactuca pseudovirosa, commonly known as the slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, white seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other lettuce species but is distinct in its growth habit and floral structure."
