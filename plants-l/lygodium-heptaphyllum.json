    "intro": "Lygodium heptaphyllum, commonly known as the seven-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of its native wetland ecosystems."
