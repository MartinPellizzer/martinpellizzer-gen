    "intro": "Lastrea yunkweiensis, commonly known as the Yunkwei lastrea, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and prefers a humid, shaded environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are wiry and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
