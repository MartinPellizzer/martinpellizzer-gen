    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved water-hobble, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip. Small, blue to purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
