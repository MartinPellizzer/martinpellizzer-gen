    "intro": "Lycopodium saururus var. inflexus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. This variety is notable for its primitive structure, reflecting its ancient lineage among vascular plants."
