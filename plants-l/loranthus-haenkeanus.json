    "intro": "Loranthus haenkeanus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Andean regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pale green leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow color, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
