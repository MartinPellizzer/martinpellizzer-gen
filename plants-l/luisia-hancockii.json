It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in pine flatwoods. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant pink to purple blooms during the summer months. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
