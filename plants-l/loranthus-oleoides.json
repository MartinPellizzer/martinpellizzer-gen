    "intro": "Loranthus oleoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in ecological interactions and traditional medicine."
