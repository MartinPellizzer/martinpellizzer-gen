    "intro": "Lycopsis lutea, commonly known as the yellow lycopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopsis lutea plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
