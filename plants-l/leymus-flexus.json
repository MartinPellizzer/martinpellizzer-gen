    "intro": "Leymus flexus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and fine, slender leaves that often form a mat-like structure. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Leymus flexus is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ability to form dense stands makes it an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
