    "intro": "Lathyrus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lathyrus mexicanus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
