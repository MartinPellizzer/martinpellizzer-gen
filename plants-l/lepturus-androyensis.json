    "intro": "Lepturus androyensis, commonly known as the Androyensis lepturus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season, and its leaves are narrow and succulent to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
