    "intro": "Lemna oligorrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant floats on the surface of freshwater bodies and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats. Its roots are short and adventitious, anchoring it to submerged surfaces. Lemna oligorrhiza is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions and is used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
