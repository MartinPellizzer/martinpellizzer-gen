    "intro": "Luehea rosea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a small tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat, and its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Luehea rosea plays a vital role in coastal ecology by providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species."
