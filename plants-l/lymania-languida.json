    "intro": "Lymania languida, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshy environments. Lymania languida is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
