    "intro": "Luehea maroniensis, commonly known as the African beach tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows near coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
