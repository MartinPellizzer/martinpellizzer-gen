    "intro": "Lithophragma trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved rock beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Lithophragma trifoliatum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
