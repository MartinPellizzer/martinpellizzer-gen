    "intro": "Loranthus gossweileri, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant's small, white or pale green leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts."
