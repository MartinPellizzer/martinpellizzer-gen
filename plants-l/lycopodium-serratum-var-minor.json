    "intro": "Lycopodium serratum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are characteristic of its primitive evolutionary lineage. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden conditions."
