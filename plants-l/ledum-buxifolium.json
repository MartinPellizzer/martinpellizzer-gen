    "intro": "Ledum buxifolium, commonly known as the waxleaf labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It features dense, leathery foliage that is dark green and often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments."
