    "intro": "Lupinus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a small annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces spiny pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source by birds and small mammals. Lupinus nanus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, bloom in early summer and contribute to its ecological and ornamental value."
