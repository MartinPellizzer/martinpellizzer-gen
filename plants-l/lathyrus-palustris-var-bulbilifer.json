    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. bulbilifer, commonly known as swamp vetch, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with several oval-shaped leaflets. One notable botanical feature is its ability to produce bulbils, which are small plantlets that can grow into new plants, aiding in its propagation."
