    "intro": "Lepidocupania squamosa, commonly known as the scaly lepidocupania, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Lepidocarpaceae. It is characterized by its scaly, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered along the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of spore-bearing capsules that release spores into the air for dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Lepidocupania squamosa is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
