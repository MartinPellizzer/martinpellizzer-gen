    "intro": "Leandra boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in the humid, high-altitude environments it inhabits. Leandra boliviensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
