    "intro": "Limosella lineata var. brevistylis, commonly known as the narrow-styled sandflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native pollinators."
