    "intro": "Lagetta, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, orange-red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruit, which resembles a pomegranate but is much smaller, contains edible seeds surrounded by a tart, juicy pulp. Lagetta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun. It is also valued for its fragrant foliage and ability to thrive in dry, coastal conditions."
