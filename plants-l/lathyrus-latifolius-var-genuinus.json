    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pea, is a perennial climbing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces showy, pea-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has a well-developed root system and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. It is notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
