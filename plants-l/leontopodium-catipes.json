    "intro": "Leontopodium catipes, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by a ring of soft, fuzzy bracts. The plant has a short, upright stem and basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its unique appearance and association with alpine landscapes, it is a symbol of resilience and is often cultivated in gardens."
