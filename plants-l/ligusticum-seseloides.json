It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ligusticum seseloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
