    "intro": "Lycopodium delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. Lycopodium delicatulum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
