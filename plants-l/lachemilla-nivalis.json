    "intro": "Lachemilla nivalis, commonly known as the alpine moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Lachemilla nivalis is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
