    "intro": "Lepisanthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Lepisanthes angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
