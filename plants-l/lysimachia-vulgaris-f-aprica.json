    "intro": "Lysimachia vulgaris f. aprica, commonly known as the spring yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the species Lysimachia vulgaris, with the 'f. aprica' indicating its specific form characterized by earlier flowering."
