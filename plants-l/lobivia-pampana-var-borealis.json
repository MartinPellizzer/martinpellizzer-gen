It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
