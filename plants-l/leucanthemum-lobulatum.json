    "intro": "Leucanthemum lobulatum, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to the sandy soils of the northern United States and Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained, dry environments and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and sandy fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
