    "intro": "Liparis truncata, commonly known as the cutleaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often truncate at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Liparis truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
