    "intro": "Lacostea singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Singapore. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species."
