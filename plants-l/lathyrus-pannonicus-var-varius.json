    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. varius, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The flowers are typically purple or violet, arranged in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
