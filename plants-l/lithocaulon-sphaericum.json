    "intro": "Lithocaulon sphaericum, commonly known as the globular stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Lithocaulon sphaericum is also noted for its resilience to drought and its ability to form dense colonies over time."
