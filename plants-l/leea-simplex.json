    "intro": "Leea simplex, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub with smooth, pale bark and opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Leea simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and adaptability."
