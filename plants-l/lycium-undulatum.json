    "intro": "Lycium undulatum, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium undulatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
