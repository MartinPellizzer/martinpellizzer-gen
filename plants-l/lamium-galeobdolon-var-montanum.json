    "intro": "Lamium galeobdolon var. montanum, commonly known as mountain dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
