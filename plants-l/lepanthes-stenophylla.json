    "intro": "Lepanthes stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Lepanthes stenophylla is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
