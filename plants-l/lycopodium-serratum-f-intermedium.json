It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. This fern ally is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
