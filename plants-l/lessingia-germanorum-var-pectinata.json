It is characterized by its distinctive, pectinate (toothed) leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats. This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptation to arid environments."
