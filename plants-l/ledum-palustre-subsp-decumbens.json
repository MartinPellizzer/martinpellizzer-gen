    "intro": "Ledum palustre subsp. decumbens, commonly known as swamp laburnum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. Its botanical features make it an important species in peatland ecosystems."
