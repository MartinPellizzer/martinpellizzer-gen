    "intro": "Lycopodium keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
