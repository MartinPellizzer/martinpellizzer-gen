    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum microphyllum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
