    "intro": "Libanothamnus neriifolius var. turmalensis, commonly known as the Turmalin lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique chemical composition, including the presence of atranorin and other secondary metabolites. The thallus is typically crustose, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
