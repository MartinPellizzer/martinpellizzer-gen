It is characterized by its dark, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to alpine regions of Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
