It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule. Lychnophora reticulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
