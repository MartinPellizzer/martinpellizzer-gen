    "intro": "Leichhardtia lyonsioides, commonly known as the Lyons' leichhardtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It is often found in sandy or clay soils near water sources such as rivers and swamps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
