    "intro": "Lophostachys floribunda, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Lophostachys floribunda is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
