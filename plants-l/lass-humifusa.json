    "intro": "Lass humifusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in natural landscapes."
