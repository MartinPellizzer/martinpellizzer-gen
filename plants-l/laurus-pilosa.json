    "intro": "Laurus pilosa, commonly known as the hairy laurel, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. Laurus pilosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its aromatic leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
