    "intro": "Lilium thayerae, commonly known as the Thayer's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. It is a perennial herb with showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its alpine habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
