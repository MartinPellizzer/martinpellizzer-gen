    "intro": "Lycopodium henryi, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. Native to China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a distinctive underground stem system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in clusters along the stems."
