It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, typically appearing in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Leucopogon gnaphalioides is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often found in heathlands and dunes."
