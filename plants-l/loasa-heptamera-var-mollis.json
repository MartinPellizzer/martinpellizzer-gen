    "intro": "Loasa heptamera var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed loasa, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shady to partially sunny woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural wild setting."
