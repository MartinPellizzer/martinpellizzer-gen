    "intro": "Lindernia crustacea var. clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's crusted lindernia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
