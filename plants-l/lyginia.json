    "intro": "Lyginia, commonly known as water smartweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially along the veins. Lyginia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
