    "intro": "Lygistum hirtellum, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture due to their hairy surface. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This plant is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
