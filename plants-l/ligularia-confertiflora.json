    "intro": "Ligularia confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to shaded landscapes."
