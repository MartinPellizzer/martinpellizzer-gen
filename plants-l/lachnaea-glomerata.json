    "intro": "Lachnaea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms dense, compact growths on tree trunks and bark, often appearing as a greenish or yellowish crust. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air. It is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its slow growth rate. Lachnaea glomerata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
