    "intro": "Lepisorus shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus shensiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
