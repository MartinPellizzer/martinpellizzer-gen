    "intro": "Lathyrus cicera subsp. sativus, commonly known as the field vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
