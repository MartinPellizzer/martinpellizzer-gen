    "intro": "Lecythis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lecythis, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and produces distinctive, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. The tree's fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds enclosed in a fleshy, edible aril. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance. The plant plays a significant role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
