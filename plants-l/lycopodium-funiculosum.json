    "intro": "Lycopodium funiculosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a sporophytic generation that dominates its life cycle, with the gametophytic stage being short-lived. Lycopodium funiculosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
