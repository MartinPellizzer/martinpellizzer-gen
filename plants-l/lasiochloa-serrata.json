    "intro": "Lasiochloa serrata, commonly known as the serrated hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Lasiochloa serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
