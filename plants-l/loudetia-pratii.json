    "intro": "Loudetia pratii, commonly known as the marsh grass or purple grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often displaying shades of purple or pink. Loudetia pratii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
