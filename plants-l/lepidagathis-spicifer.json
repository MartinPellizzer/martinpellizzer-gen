    "intro": "Lepidagathis spicifer, commonly known as the spiky lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lepidagathis spicifer is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and savannas."
