    "intro": "Leutea glaucopruinosa, commonly known as the waxy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which gives the plant its common name and helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
