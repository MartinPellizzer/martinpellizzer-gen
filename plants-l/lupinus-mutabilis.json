    "intro": "Lupinus mutabilis, commonly known as the Andean lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that change hues throughout the day. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces erect, spindly stems. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in the Andes Mountains. Lupinus mutabilis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment."
