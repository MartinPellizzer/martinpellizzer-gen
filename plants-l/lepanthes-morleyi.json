    "intro": "Lepanthes morleyi, commonly known as the Morley's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that often display a combination of red, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornamental, with intricate petal structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes morleyi is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique appearance."
