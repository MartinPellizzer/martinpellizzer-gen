    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. ramosum, commonly known as hairy ryegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense growth habit and robust root system. It features slender, ascending stems with a hairy texture, particularly on the lower parts, which gives it its common name. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a bluish-green coloration. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to purplish in color. This variety is often used in forage production and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
