    "intro": "Listera uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraian wintergreen, is a flowering plant species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive waxy texture, while its fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds in the fall. Listera uraiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
