    "intro": "Loranthus alboannulatus, commonly known as the white-ring mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful."
