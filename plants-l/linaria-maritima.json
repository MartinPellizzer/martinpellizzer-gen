It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces vibrant, delicate flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red. Its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns that resemble the shape of a pansy, giving it its common name. Linaria maritima is well adapted to salt spray and can withstand harsh maritime conditions."
