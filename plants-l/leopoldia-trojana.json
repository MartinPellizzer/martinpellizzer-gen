It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex flowering pattern, often requiring specific environmental conditions to trigger blooming. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as threatened by the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
