    "intro": "Luma acrophylla, commonly known as the pohutukawa, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows along coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Luma acrophylla plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems and is also culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people."
