    "intro": "Leochilus leiboldii, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several flower heads, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. Leochilus leiboldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
