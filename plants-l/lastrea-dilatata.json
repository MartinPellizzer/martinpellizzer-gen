    "intro": "Lastrea dilatata, commonly known as the starry rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Lastrea dilatata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in arid climates."
