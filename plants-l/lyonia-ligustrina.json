    "intro": "Lyonia ligustrina, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are edible when ripe but toxic when unripe. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive serrated edge. Lyonia ligustrina is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
