    "intro": "Leontopodium nivale subsp. nivale, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and a single, showy yellow flower surrounded by white bracts. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments where it forms a low-growing mat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is adapted to cold climates with poor soil conditions. Due to its iconic appearance, it is often associated with alpine landscapes and is a symbol of purity and resilience."
