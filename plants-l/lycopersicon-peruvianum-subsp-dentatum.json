    "intro": "Lycopersicon peruvianum subsp. dentatum, commonly known as the Peruvian tomato, is a wild relative of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically less fleshy than those of cultivated tomatoes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in South American regions like Peru and Ecuador. This subspecies is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve cultivated tomato varieties."
