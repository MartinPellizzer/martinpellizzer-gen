    "intro": "Leianthus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeycreepers, due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
