    "intro": "Leptocyamus clandestinus var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cryptic lichen, is a rare and elusive species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its compact, foliose thallus with a dark, almost blackish upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on bark or soil in temperate forest regions. It has a slow growth rate and is often difficult to detect due to its inconspicuous appearance. This varietal form is distinguished by its smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
