    "intro": "Luziola fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant violet, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its fragility, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
