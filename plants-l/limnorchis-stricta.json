    "intro": "Limnorchis stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Limnorchis stricta thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy aquatic ecosystems."
