    "intro": "Lepidotis radicans, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Lepidotis radicans is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
