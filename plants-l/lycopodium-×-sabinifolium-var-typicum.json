    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 sabinifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, feathery foliage. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in forested areas. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodium \u00d7 sabinifolium var. typicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its lush, carpet-like growth."
