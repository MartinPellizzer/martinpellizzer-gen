    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth privet, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
