    "intro": "Lunathyrium ningshenense, commonly known as the Ningshen grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind pollination for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
