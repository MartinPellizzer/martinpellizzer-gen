    "intro": "Lennoa arenaria, commonly known as the sandy lennoa, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy and salty environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing dunes. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in arid conditions. Lennoa arenaria is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a key role in preventing erosion."
