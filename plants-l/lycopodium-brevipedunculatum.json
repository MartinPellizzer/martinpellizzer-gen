    "intro": "Lycopodium brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stalked clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Lycopodium brevipedunculatum plays a role in providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
