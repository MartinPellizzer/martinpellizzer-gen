    "intro": "Lepanthes paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and produces delicate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic in its early stages but becomes terrestrial as it matures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepanthes paradoxa is prized for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
