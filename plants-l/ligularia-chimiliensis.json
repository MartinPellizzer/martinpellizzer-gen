    "intro": "Ligularia chimiliensis, commonly known as the Himalayan ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its striking foliage and floral display, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
