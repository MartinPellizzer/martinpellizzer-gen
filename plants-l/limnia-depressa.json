    "intro": "Limnia depressa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that produce small, oval leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Limnia depressa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
