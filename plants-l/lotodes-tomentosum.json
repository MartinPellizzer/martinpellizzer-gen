    "intro": "Lotodes tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, hairy leaves that float on the water's surface, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems spread across the water's surface. Lotodes tomentosum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
