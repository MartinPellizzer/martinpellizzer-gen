    "intro": "Lycopodium subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in cold, moist environments. It belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around its stem. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobili, are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium subarcticum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for cold climates."
