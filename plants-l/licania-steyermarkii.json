    "intro": "Licania steyermarkii, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruits, though they are not related to the genus Averrhoa. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
