    "intro": "Linaria bipartita var. persicina, commonly known as the Persian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slight hairy texture. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Linaria, which are known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
