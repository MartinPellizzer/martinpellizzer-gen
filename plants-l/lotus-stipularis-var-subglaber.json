    "intro": "Lotus stipularis var. subglaber, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features elongated, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are slender and often branching, with a fibrous, spongy texture. The variety subglaber is distinguished by its reduced stipules, giving it a more streamlined appearance compared to other lotus species."
