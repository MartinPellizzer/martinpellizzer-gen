    "intro": "Leptochilus cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and wetland ecosystems."
