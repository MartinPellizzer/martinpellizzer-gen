    "intro": "Lilium concolor var. partheneion, commonly known as the Partheneion lily, is a rare and striking variant of the white lily native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored, often slightly pinkish, flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that are highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. It is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
