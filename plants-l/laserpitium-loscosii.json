    "intro": "Laserpitium loscosii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lasrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
