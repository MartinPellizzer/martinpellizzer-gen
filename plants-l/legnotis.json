    "intro": "Legnotis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody roots that form a dense network underwater, aiding in stabilizing shorelines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Legnotis plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
