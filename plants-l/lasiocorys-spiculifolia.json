It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring elongated, spiky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
