    "intro": "Lingoum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the class Lecanoromycetes. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces large, orange to reddish apothecia, which are the reproductive structures containing spores. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems."
