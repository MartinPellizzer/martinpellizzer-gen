    "intro": "Lotodes physodes, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or pond mud. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss and support the weight of the flowers. The flowers are usually white or pink, with a central yellow or orange stamen, and they open during the day to attract pollinators."
