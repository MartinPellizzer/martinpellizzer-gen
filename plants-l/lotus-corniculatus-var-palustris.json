    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bird's-foot trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and have a distinctive bird's-foot shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
