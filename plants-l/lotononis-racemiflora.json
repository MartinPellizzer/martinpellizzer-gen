It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
