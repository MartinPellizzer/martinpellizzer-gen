    "intro": "Lomatium depauperatum, commonly known as the slender lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its foliage is often finely divided, and it produces a cluster of small seeds in a single, umbel-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
