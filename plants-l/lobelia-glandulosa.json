    "intro": "Lobelia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Lobelia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
