    "intro": "Lupinus muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's lupin, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, bushy growth habit. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus muelleri is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
