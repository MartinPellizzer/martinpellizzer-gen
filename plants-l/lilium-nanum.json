    "intro": "Lilium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small, perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of only 10-20 centimeters, making it one of the smallest species in the lily family. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Lilium nanum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
