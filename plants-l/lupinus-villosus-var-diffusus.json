    "intro": "Lupinus villosus var. diffusus, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a perennial legume native to western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil enrichment."
