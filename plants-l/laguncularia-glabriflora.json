    "intro": "Laguncularia glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are small, globose berries that contain a single seed, and they are adapted for dispersal by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
