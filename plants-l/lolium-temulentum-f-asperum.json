    "intro": "Lolium temulentum f. asperum, commonly known as rough ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass species. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other ryegrass varieties. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. It is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its rapid growth. The rough texture of its foliage is a key botanical feature that aids in its identification."
