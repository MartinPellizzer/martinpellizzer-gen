    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus proles rothii, commonly known as the large-rooted vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
