It is characterized by its robust, aromatic foliage and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and the stems are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its large, showy flowers, which can reach up to 5 cm in diameter, making it a standout in its native habitat."
