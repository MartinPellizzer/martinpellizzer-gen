It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
