    "intro": "Laserpitium thapsioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed habitats. Laserpitium thapsioides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
