It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Linostigma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
