    "intro": "Lupinus arizelus, commonly known as Arizona lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Lupinus arizelus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
