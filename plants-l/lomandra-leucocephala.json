    "intro": "Lomandra leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Lomandra leucocephala also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators such as bees and birds."
