    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. nivalis, commonly known as the Snowy Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features thick, ribbed stems that are typically pale green to blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
