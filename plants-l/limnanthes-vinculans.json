    "intro": "Limnanthes vinculans, commonly known as the meadow foam, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a short, annual life cycle and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, fuzzy, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The plant is also valued for its ecological benefits, including providing nectar for pollinators."
