    "intro": "Lantana camara subsp. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in local ecosystems."
