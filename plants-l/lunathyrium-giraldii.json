    "intro": "Lunathyrium giraldii, commonly known as the mountain moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
