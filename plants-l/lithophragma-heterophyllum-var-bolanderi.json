    "intro": "Lithophragma heterophyllum var. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
