    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassy areas and has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. This subspecies is also noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
