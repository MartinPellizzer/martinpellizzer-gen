    "intro": "Lepanthes psyche, commonly known as the Psychic Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
