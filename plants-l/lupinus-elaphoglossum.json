    "intro": "Lupinus elaphoglossum, commonly known as the alpine lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus elaphoglossum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
