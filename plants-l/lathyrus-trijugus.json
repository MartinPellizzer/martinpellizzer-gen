    "intro": "Lathyrus trijugus, commonly known as the three-lobed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a climbing habit and possesses tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lathyrus trijugus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
