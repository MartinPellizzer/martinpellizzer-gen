    "intro": "Littonia revoilii, commonly known as the Revoil's littonia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale blue to white. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along its stem. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
