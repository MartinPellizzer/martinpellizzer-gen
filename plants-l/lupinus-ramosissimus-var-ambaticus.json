    "intro": "Lupinus ramosissimus var. ambaticus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
