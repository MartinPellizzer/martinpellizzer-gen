    "intro": "Lotononis pumila, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Lotononis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
