    "intro": "Lotus wiedemannii, commonly known as the Mexican lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central America. It features large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. Lotus wiedemannii is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ecological benefits."
