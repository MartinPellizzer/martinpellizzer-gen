    "intro": "Ligularia muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis Ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces striking yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
