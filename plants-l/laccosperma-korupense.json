    "intro": "Laccosperma korupense, commonly known as the Korup ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
