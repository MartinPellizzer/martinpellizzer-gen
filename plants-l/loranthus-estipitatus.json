    "intro": "Loranthus estipitatus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus estipitatus is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems."
