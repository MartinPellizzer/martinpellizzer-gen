These plants are typically found in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, marshes, and heathlands. They are characterized by their slender stems and showy, often greenish or yellowish flowers. Liparis species are epiphytic or terrestrial, with some species growing on trees or in soil. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are adapted to nutrient-poor conditions."
