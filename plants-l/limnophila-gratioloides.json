    "intro": "Limnophila gratioloides, commonly known as water hyssop, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually blue or purple and bloom in clusters. Limnophila gratioloides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
