    "intro": "Laurus laevigata, commonly known as the Australian laurel or broad-leaved laurel, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Laurus laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
