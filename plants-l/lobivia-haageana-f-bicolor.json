    "intro": "Lobivia haageana f. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded stems covered in short, white to pale green spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its bicolor pattern, with green and white markings on the stem surface."
