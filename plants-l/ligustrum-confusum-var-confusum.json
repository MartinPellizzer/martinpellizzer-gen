It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
