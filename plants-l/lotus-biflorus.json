    "intro": "Lotus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered water lotus, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense floating mats. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The lotus has a long history of cultural and medicinal significance in traditional Asian practices."
