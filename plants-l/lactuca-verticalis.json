    "intro": "Lactuca verticalis, commonly known as upright lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loosely arranged leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, round seeds. It is often grown for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter flavor. Lactuca verticalis is a cool-season crop that prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
