    "intro": "Liparis cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive hood-like structure. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The orchid blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths."
