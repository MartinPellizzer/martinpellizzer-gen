    "intro": "Luisia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's luisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Luisia curtisii is considered a conservation concern."
