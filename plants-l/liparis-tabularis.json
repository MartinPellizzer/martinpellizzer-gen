    "intro": "Liparis tabularis, commonly known as the flat-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually over time. Liparis tabularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
