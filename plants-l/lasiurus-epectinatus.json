    "intro": "Lasiurus epectinatus, commonly known as the silky-haired batik, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, branching stems covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive silvery-gray underside, contributing to its ornamental value. The silky-haired batik is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
