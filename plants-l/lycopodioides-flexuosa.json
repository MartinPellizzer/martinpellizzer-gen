    "intro": "Lycopodioides flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its reproductive structures include sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of lycophytes. Lycopodioides flexuosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
