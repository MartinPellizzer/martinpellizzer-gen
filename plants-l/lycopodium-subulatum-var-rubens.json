    "intro": "Lycopodium subulatum var. rubens, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
