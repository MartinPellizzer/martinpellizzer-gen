    "intro": "Lechea pulchella var. minor, commonly known as the lesser lechea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it has a compact, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
