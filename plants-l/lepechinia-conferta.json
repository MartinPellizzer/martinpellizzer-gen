It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-elevation environments. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Lepechinia conferta is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
