    "intro": "Littorella spicata, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. Littorella spicata is often found in intertidal zones, contributing to coastal vegetation and providing habitat for various small organisms. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
