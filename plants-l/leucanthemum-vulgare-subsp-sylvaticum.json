    "intro": "Leucanthemum vulgare subsp. sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc in late summer to early autumn. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Leucanthemum vulgare."
