    "intro": "Loranthus micranthus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems or branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are typically scale-like and lack true stomata, which is a characteristic feature of many mistletoe species. Loranthus micranthus plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and health of its host trees."
