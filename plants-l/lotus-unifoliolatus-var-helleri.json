    "intro": "Lotus unifoliolatus var. helleri, commonly known as the Heller's lotus, is a rare and striking aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, single leaf that is often deeply lobed or divided, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and pond margins. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
