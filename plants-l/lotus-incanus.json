    "intro": "Lotus incanus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies, and has heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod-like structure and are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic habitats. The lotus incanus is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
