    "intro": "Loranthus courtallensis, commonly known as the Courtallense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its fruit is a globose capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
