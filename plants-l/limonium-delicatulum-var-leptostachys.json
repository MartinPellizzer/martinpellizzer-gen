    "intro": "Limonium delicatulum var. leptostachys, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters atop slender, branching stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
