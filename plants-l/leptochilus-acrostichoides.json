    "intro": "Leptochilus acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a dense, upright clump. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Leptochilus acrostichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
