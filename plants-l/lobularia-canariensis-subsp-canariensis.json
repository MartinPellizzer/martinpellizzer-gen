    "intro": "Lobularia canariensis subsp. canariensis, commonly known as Canary Island lobularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
