    "intro": "Lithocarpus lepidocarpus, commonly known as the silverleaf stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves with a silvery underside. The tree produces small, woody nuts enclosed in a cupule, which are typically dispersed by animals. Its bark is thick and fissured, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins. This species plays an important ecological role in tropical forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
