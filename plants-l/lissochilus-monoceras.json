    "intro": "Lissochilus monoceras, commonly known as the single-horned orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a single, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lissochilus monoceras is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
