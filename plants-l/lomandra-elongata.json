    "intro": "Lomandra elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers on tall, leafless stems during spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Lomandra elongata is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in native gardens."
