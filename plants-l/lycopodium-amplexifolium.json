    "intro": "Lycopodium amplexifolium, commonly known as the clasping fern, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a stout, creeping stem with whorled leaves that often encircle the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium amplexifolium is often found in rocky or woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
