    "intro": "Lycopodium aristatum var. incurvum, commonly known as the curled clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to certain regions of North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophyte stage produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. The curled appearance of its leaves is a defining feature that aids in its identification."
