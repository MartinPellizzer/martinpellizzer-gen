    "intro": "Lipocarpha albiceps, commonly known as the white-headed sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and tidal influences. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Lipocarpha albiceps plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
