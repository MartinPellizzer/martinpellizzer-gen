    "intro": "Lens soloniensis, commonly known as the Solon's lens, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, lens-shaped seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces pods that contain the distinctive lens-shaped seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
