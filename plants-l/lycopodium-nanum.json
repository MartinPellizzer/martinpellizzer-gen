    "intro": "Lycopodium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing stature. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain spores for reproduction. Lycopodium nanum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, carpet-like appearance."
