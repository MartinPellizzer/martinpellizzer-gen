    "intro": "Ladenbergia discolor, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, often with a compact and bushy habit. Its flowers are usually pink, purple, or white, and they bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Ladenbergia discolor is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its preference for bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
