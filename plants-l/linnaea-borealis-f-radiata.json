    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. radiata, commonly known as the star-like twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in pairs along the stems. Its botanical features include a mat-forming growth habit and the ability to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments. This form is distinguished by its more pronounced floral display and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical species."
