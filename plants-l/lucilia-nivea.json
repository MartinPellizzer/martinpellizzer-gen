    "intro": "Lucilia nivea, commonly known as the white bottle fly, is a species of blowfly found in various parts of the world. It is characterized by its pale, almost white body and metallic green eyes. The larvae of Lucilia nivea are often found on decaying organic matter, playing a role in decomposition. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an insect, not a botanical organism. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe."
