    "intro": "Lavandula dhofarensis subsp. ayunensis, commonly known as the Ayunensis lavender, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Oman. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant purple flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
