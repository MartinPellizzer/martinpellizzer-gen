    "intro": "Lomatium frenchii, commonly known as the French mountain lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a peppery scent, similar to other members of the carrot family. Lomatium frenchii is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
