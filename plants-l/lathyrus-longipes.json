    "intro": "Lathyrus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Lathyrus longipes is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
