    "intro": "Lecanopteris spinosa, commonly known as the spinous wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spinulose fronds that are often covered in small, bristle-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple upright, lanceolate leaves. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
