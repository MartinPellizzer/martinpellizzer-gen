    "intro": "Loreya spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's loreya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually pale blue or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Loreya spruceana is considered a vulnerable species."
