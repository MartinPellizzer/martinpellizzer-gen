    "intro": "Lamprotis lucida, commonly known as the golden-eyed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lamprotis lucida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
