It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
