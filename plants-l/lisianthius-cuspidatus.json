    "intro": "Lisianthius cuspidatus, commonly known as the spiny lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spiny fruits that contain the seeds. Lisianthius cuspidatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
