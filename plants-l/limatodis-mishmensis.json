    "intro": "Limatodis mishmensis, commonly known as the Mishmensis bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limatodis mishmensis is considered a vulnerable species."
