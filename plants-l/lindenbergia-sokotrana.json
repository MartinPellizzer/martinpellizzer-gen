    "intro": "Lindenbergia sokotrana, commonly known as the Sokotra starfish flower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers that resemble the appearance of a starfish. The plant typically grows in arid and rocky environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, while its flowers are brightly colored to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
