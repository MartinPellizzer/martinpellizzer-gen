    "intro": "Loxotrema capillaris, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its foliose growth form. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure. It lacks true leaves but has a photosynthetic layer composed of algae and fungi. This lichen is often found in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
