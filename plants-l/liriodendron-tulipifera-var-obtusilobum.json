    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the northern tulip tree, is a variant of the tulip tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with rounded lobes, which set it apart from the typical tulip tree. The plant produces showy, tulip-like yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
