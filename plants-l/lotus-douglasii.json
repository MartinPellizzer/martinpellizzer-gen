    "intro": "Lotus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The Douglas lotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
