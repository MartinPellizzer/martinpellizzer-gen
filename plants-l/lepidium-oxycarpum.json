    "intro": "Lepidium oxycarpum, commonly known as the sharpseeded cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its distinctive, elongated, seed-like structures called siliques. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Lepidium oxycarpum is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
