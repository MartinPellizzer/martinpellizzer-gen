    "intro": "Lannea fulva, commonly known as the yellow-wood tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and poison ivy. The tree is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Lannea fulva is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
