    "intro": "Liriope longipedicellata, commonly known as the large-fruited lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, three-lobed berries that remain on the plant well into winter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Liriope longipedicellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
