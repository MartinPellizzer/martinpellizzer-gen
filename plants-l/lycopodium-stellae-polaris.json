It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble tiny stars, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodium stellae-polaris plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
