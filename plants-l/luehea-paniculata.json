    "intro": "Luehea paniculata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in swampy environments and facilitate gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Luehea paniculata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
