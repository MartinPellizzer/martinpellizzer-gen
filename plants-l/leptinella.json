    "intro": "Leptinella, commonly known as stonecress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials or annuals, often found in rocky or alpine environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple, and they have a compact growth habit. The leaves are generally basal, arranged in rosettes, and are often covered in fine hairs. Leptinella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in rock gardens or as ground cover."
