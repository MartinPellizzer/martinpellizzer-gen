    "intro": "Lindsaea cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Lindsaea cuneata produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
