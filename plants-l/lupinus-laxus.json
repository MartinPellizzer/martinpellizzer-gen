    "intro": "Lupinus laxus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus laxus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
