    "intro": "Lepechinia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud alpine or cloud mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are often white or pale blue, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
