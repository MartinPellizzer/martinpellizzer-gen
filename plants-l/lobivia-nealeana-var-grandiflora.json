    "intro": "Lobivia nealeana var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Neale's Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
