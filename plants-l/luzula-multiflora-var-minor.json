    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf wood rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue-green hues. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
