    "intro": "Lamium mutabile, commonly known as the variable deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. Lamium mutabile is also known for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
