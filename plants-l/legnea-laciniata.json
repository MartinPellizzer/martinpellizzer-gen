    "intro": "Legnea laciniata, commonly known as the shredded legume, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive, almost shredded appearance. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically purple or pink, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Legnea laciniata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
