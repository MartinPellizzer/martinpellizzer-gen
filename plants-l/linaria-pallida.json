    "intro": "Linaria pallida, commonly known as the pale toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Linaria pallida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
