    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 grassiorum, commonly known as the hybrid meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Leontodon alpinus and Leontodon tectorum, two species within the dandelion family. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Leontodon \u00d7 grassiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
