    "intro": "Lomariopsis variabilis, commonly known as the variable lomariopsis, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are usually bright green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Lomariopsis variabilis is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
