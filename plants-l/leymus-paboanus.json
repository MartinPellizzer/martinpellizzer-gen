    "intro": "Leymus paboanus, commonly known as the Paboan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in panicles, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Leymus paboanus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
