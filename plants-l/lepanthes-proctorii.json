    "intro": "Lepanthes proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Lepanthes proctorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
