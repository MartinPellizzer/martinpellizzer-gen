It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a leafy stem and is characterized by its greenish-yellow color. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Lastreopsis silvestris plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
