    "intro": "Lonicera valentina, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. Lonicera valentina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
