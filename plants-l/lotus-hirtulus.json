    "intro": "Lotus hirtulus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its root system forms a dense mat, which can help stabilize sediment in water bodies. Lotus hirtulus is often cultivated in ponds and wetlands for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
