    "intro": "Lupinus sabulosus, commonly known as sand lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Lupinus sabulosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
