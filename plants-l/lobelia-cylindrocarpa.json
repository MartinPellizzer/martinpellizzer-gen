    "intro": "Lobelia cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the cylindrical lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Lobelia cylindrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
