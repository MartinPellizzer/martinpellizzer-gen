    "intro": "Leucopogon pleiospermus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern coast of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, which attract nectar-feeding insects. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its often salty and windy environment. Leucopogon pleiospermus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
