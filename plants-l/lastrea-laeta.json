It features fleshy, upright stems with small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and container plantings."
