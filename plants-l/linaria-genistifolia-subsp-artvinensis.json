    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia subsp. artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin linaria, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of northeastern Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, typically found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
