    "intro": "Ligularia mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
