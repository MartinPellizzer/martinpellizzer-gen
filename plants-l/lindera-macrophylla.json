    "intro": "Lindera macrophylla, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. Its aromatic leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lindera macrophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
