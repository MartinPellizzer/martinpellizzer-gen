    "intro": "Lepidium heterophyllum f. longistylum, commonly known as the long-styled cress, is a botanical variant within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated stamens, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces small, rounded seeds. The f. longistylum form is notable for its unique floral morphology, which contributes to its ecological and horticultural significance."
