    "intro": "Lotononis fruticoides, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lotononis fruticoides is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
