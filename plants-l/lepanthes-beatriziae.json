    "intro": "Lepanthes beatriziae, commonly known as the Beatrizia orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically feature white or pale pink petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat. Lepanthes beatriziae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
