    "intro": "Linaria saxatilis var. pseudofilifolia, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and naturalized areas."
