    "intro": "Leptocarpus scoparius, commonly known as the coastal rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of its fertile leaves. It thrives in saline and humid environments, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. Due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
