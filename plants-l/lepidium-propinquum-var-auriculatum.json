    "intro": "Lepidium propinquum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate cress, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in meadows. The plant has smooth, hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive auriculate (ear-like) bases. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The seeds are small, oval, and often have a pungent odor, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
