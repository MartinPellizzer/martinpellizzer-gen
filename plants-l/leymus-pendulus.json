    "intro": "Leymus pendulus, commonly known as the drooping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, arching stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Leymus pendulus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
