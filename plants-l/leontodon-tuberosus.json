    "intro": "Leontodon tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its tuberous roots are an important characteristic, contributing to its hardiness and ability to survive in various soil conditions. Leontodon tuberosus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges."
