    "intro": "Lindera sericea, commonly known as silverleaf ligusticum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its fruits are small, dark purple drupes that mature in late summer. Lindera sericea is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
