    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. subcurvifolius, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species is native to southern Africa and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
