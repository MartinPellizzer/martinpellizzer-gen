    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota subvar. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf privet, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its oval to broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by small, black berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and dense growth habit. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
