    "intro": "Lonicera vesicaria, commonly known as the common honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are red, berry-like structures that mature in late summer and are edible for both humans and wildlife. Lonicera vesicaria is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
