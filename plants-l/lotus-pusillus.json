    "intro": "Lotus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf lotus, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes, and thrives in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant features compact, floating leaves that are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and pale pink or white, emerging on short stalks above the water surface. Lotus pusillus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
