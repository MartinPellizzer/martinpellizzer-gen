    "intro": "Lithops villetii subsp. deboeri, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
