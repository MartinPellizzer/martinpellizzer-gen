    "intro": "Lupulus lupuloides ulmifolius, commonly known as the European hop, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of the elm, hence its specific epithet *ulmifolius*. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are used in traditional medicine and brewing. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. The plant is also noted for its aromatic properties, which have been utilized in various cultural and industrial applications."
