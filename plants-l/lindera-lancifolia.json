    "intro": "Lindera lancifolia, commonly known as Japanese spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Lindera lancifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and fragrant leaves."
