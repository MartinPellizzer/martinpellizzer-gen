    "intro": "Leptobalanus foveolatus, commonly known as the dwarf beech, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
