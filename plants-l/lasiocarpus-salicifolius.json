    "intro": "Lasiocarpus salicifolius, commonly known as the silkybark or redstem silkybark, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, zigzagging stems that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it its common name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody, capsule-like fruits. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
