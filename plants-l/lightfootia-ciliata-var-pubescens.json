    "intro": "Lightfootia ciliata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lightfootia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine pubescence, which may aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
