    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus vulgaris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The plant is known for its ornamental value, with its glossy foliage and showy blossoms making it a popular choice in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and it is relatively hardy, though it may require protection in colder climates. The fruit is a small, dark red drupe that develops after the flowers."
