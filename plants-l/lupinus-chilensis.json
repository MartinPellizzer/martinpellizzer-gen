    "intro": "Lupinus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean lupin, is a perennial legume native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces elliptical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus chilensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
