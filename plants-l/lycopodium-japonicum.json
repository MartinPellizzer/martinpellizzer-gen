    "intro": "Lycopodium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium japonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine in some cultures."
