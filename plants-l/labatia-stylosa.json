    "intro": "Labatia stylosa, commonly known as the purple passionvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, purple-pink flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a strong, often disagreeable odor, which is typical of many members of its family. Labatia stylosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
