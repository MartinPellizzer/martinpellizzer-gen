    "intro": "Lobivia chrysantha subsp. marsoneri, commonly known as the Sonoran Desert lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Sonoran Desert region. It features dense, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It has small, spiny areoles and is adapted to thrive in arid, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and succulent gardens."
