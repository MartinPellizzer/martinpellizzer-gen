    "intro": "Leptocarpus ramosissimus, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a compact growth habit with multiple branches, giving it a bushy appearance. Due to its salt tolerance, it is well adapted to maritime climates and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
