    "intro": "Limonium wrightii f. albolutescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive, spiky, white or pale blue flower heads that resemble small, clustered bells. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, adding a striking visual contrast to the coastal landscape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens and as a cut flower."
