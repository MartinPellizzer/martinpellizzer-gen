    "intro": "Licuala bintulensis, commonly known as the Bintul Peninsular palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Bintul Peninsula in Malaysia and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant typically grows in swampy or wetland habitats, thriving in humid and tropical conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Licuala bintulensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
