It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a firm, leathery layer on the substrate. The plant typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid and shaded environments."
