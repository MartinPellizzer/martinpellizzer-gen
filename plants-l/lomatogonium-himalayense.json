It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often lobed and hairy, while its flowers are yellow or orange, adding visual interest to its natural habitat. Lomatogonium himalayense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
