    "intro": "Lyonia marginata, commonly known as the coastal lyonia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are narrow, leathery, and often have a distinctive white or silver margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Lyonia marginata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and drought. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
