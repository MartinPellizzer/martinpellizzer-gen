    "intro": "Lepturus radicans, commonly known as the creeping lepturus, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to colonize ground surfaces effectively. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Lepturus radicans is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
