    "intro": "Loranthus wightii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Loranthus wightii is found in various parts of India and is an important component of the ecological interactions within forest ecosystems."
