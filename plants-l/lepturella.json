    "intro": "Lepturella, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems, which are typical of many members of the aster family. The leaves are usually alternate and often have a rough texture, with some species displaying a bluish or grayish hue. Lepturella species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, growing in rocky soils or on slopes. They are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
