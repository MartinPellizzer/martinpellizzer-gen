    "intro": "Leptonychia bampsii var. bampsii, commonly known as the Bamps' rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
