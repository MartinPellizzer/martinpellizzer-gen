    "intro": "Lavandula nooruddinii, commonly known as the Nooruddin lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its fragrant, spike-like inflorescences of purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, grey-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild lavender scent, which is less intense than that of common lavender varieties."
