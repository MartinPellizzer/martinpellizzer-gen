    "intro": "Lycium glaucum, commonly known as the silverberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its grayish-blue leaves and small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. Lycium glaucum is often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as a source of food for wildlife."
