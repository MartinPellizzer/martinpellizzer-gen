    "intro": "Larnax bongaraensis, commonly known as the Bongaraensis larnax, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Larnaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of large trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment it thrives in. Due to habitat loss, Larnax bongaraensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
