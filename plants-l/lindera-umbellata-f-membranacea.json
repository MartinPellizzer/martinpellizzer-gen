    "intro": "Lindera umbellata f. membranacea, commonly known as the membranous-flowered ligustrum, is a variant of the fragrant woodbine. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This form is distinguished by its thin, papery texture on the underside of the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
