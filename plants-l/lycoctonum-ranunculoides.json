    "intro": "Lycoctonum ranunculoides, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some areas. The flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days before wilting."
