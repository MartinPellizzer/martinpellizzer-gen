It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces showy, clustered panicles of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. The varietal name 'brevifolia' refers to its short or brief leaves, distinguishing it from other crape myrtle varieties."
