It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its distinctive appearance."
