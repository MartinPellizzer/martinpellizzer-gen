    "intro": "Lepidophorum repandum, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, aiding in water repellence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pink, often opening in the early morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients. Lepidophorum repandum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
