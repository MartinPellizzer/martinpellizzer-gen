It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is native to the eastern region of South Africa. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by interacting with host trees and supporting local wildlife."
