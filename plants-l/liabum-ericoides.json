    "intro": "Liabum ericoides, commonly known as the heath leaved liabum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Liabum ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
