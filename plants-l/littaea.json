    "intro": "Littaea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, silver-blue foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia, Littaea thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
