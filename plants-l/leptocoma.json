    "intro": "Leptocoma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spatulate-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. They are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to their toxic properties, they are not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
