    "intro": "Loranthus pseudochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate forest environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees."
