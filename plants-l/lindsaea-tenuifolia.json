    "intro": "Lindsaea tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia. Lindsaea tenuifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
