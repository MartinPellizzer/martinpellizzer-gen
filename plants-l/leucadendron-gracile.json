It is characterized by its slender, candle-like stems and small, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Leucadendron gracile is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
