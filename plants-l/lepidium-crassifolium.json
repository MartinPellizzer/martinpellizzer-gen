    "intro": "Lepidium crassifolium, commonly known as broad-leaved peppergrass, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Lepidium crassifolium is also known for its small, round, edible seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
