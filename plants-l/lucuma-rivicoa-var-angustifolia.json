It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange fruit, which is encased in a thick, leathery outer layer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it is valued for its sweet, creamy flavor and nutritional content."
