    "intro": "Lepidaploa orbicularis, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a unique species characterized by its rounded, disc-like thallus. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on tree bark in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a leathery texture with a pale to dark green coloration, often with a distinct central umbilicus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship with algae for nutrition. This lichen is an important indicator species for forest health and biodiversity."
