    "intro": "Lanium avicula, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, bird's nest-like structure formed by its tightly clustered, leafless stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lanium avicula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
