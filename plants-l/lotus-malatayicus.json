    "intro": "Lotus malatayicus, commonly known as the Malaya lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and even red, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the sediment, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems. The Malaya lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in local cultures."
