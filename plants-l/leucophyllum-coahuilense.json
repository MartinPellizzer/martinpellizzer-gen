    "intro": "Leucophyllum coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuilan flamebrush, is a shrub native to the Chihuahuan Desert of northern Mexico and the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red, typically in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular plant in desert gardens."
