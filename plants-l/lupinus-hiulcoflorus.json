    "intro": "Lupinus hiulcoflorus, commonly known as the silverleaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to two meters in height, covered in dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Lupinus hiulcoflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
