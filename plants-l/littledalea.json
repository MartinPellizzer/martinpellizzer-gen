    "intro": "Littledalea, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Littledalea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
