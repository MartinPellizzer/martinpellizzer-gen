It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
