    "intro": "Leontonyx candidissimus, commonly known as the white-leaved lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on bark or stone in temperate forests. The plant's structure is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth that forms a protective layer over its substratum. Its white or pale green coloration is due to the presence of the algal partner, which performs photosynthesis. This lichen plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
