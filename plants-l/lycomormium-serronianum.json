It is characterized by its foliose growth form, with thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on bark, wood, and rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its ecological importance, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and habitat health."
