It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and may have a faintly aromatic scent. Leucopterum parvifolium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky outcrops."
