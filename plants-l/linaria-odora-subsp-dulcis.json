    "intro": "Linaria odora subsp. dulcis, commonly known as sweet flax or sweet honesty, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, spire-like clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, green seed pods that turn brown as they mature, and it has linear, grass-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of flaxseed highlights its botanical and practical significance."
