It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
