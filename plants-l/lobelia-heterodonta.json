    "intro": "Lobelia heterodonta, commonly known as the heterodonta lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinct appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
