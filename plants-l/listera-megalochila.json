    "intro": "Listera megalochila, commonly known as the giant white ground orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
