    "intro": "Limonium diegoi, commonly known as the Diego's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Limonium diegoi thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local pollinators."
