    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock lycopod, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, which allows it to anchor itself in crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil quality. This variety is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in horticultural settings."
