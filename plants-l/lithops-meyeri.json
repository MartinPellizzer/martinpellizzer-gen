    "intro": "Lithops meyeri, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically green or bluish-gray, often with distinct markings that aid in camouflage. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or summer months. Lithops meyeri is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
