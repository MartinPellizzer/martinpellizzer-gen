    "intro": "Linaria hirta var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth hairvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems that become smoother with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, which distinguish it from other similar species. Linaria hirta var. semiglabra is typically found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed soils."
