    "intro": "Lasiocladus villosus, commonly known as the woolly broom. It is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its dense, wiry branches covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lasiocladus villosus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
