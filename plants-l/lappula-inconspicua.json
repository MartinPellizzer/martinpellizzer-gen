    "intro": "Lappula inconspicua, commonly known as the common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in loose umbels, and the fruit is a hairy, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. Lappula inconspicua is known for its low-growing habit and is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance."
