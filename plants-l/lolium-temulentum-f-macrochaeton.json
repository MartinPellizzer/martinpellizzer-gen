    "intro": "Lolium temulentum f. macrochaeton, commonly known as the broad-leaved ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense stands, making it both a weed and a forage crop. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to grazing."
