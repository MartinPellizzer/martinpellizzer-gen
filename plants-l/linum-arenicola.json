    "intro": "Linum arenicola, commonly known as sand flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Linum arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
