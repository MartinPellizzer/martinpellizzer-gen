It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, orange-red berries. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are usually yellow or white. The fruit is edible when ripe, though the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
