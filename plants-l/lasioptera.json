    "intro": "Lasioptera, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy or woolly stems and leaves, which give them their common name. They typically produce bell-shaped or tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Lasioptera species are often found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
