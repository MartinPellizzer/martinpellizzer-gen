    "intro": "Leiothrix angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed leiothrix, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
