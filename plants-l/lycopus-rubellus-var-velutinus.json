    "intro": "Lycopus rubellus var. velutinus, commonly known as hairy water-honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in the summer months. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
