    "intro": "Lappula echinata, commonly known as the spiked lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. The plant features a slender, branching stem covered with small, spiny leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in dense, spherical heads, which give it a distinctive appearance. Lappula echinata is characterized by its unique seed structure, with seeds that are covered in a sticky, waxy coating."
