It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.
