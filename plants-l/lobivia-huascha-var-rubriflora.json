    "intro": "Lobivia huascha var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes of South America. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
