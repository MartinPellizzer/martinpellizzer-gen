    "intro": "Leptobalanus cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
