    "intro": "Lupinus fontis-batchelderi, commonly known as the Batchelder's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
