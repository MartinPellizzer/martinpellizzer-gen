    "intro": "Lathyrus formosus, commonly known as the Japanese vetch, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a climbing legume characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Lathyrus formosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
