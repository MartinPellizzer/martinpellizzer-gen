It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or white, and it produces capsule fruits containing small, hairy seeds.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
