    "intro": "Lyonsia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran lyonsia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, bloom in clusters and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, Lyonsia sumatrana is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
