It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellowish as it matures.
