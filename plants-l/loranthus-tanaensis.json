    "intro": "Loranthus tanaensis, commonly known as the Tana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Terminalia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Kenya. The berries it produces are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
