    "intro": "Leptodesmia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved leptodesmia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on short stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
