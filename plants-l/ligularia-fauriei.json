It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a striking green or variegated appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland gardens. Its foliage and floral display make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
