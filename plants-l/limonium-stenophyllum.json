    "intro": "Limonium stenophyllum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. Its narrow leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Limonium stenophyllum is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
