    "intro": "Lupinus sulphureus subsp. kincaidii, commonly known as Kincaid's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and palmately divided leaves, which are typical of the lupine genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along streambanks. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Kincaid's lupine is also a critical component of native plant communities and is considered a keystone species in certain ecosystems."
