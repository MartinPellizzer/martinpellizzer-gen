    "intro": "Leontopodium subulatum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and meadows. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and early autumn, and it is known for its hardiness in cold climates. Due to its striking appearance and association with alpine landscapes, it is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
