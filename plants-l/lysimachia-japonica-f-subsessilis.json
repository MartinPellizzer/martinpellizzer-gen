    "intro": "Lysimachia japonica f. subsessilis, commonly known as Japanese loosestrife, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Japan. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is characterized by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form, giving it a more compact appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
