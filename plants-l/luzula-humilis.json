    "intro": "Luzula humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish to brownish flowers in spike-like inflorescences during the late spring to early summer. Luzula humilis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
