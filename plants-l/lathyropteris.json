    "intro": "Lathyropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Lathyropteris species often have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense mats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
