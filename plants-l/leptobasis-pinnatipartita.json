    "intro": "Leptobasis pinnatipartita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are pinnately divided, giving the plant its scientific name, and are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and desert scrub."
