It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
