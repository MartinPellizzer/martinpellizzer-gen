    "intro": "Lanugothamnus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
