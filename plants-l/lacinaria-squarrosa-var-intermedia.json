    "intro": "Lacinaria squarrosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, woolly thallus. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. The plant has a pale to dark green or brownish upper surface with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are embedded in the thallus and aid in dispersal. This lichen is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution."
