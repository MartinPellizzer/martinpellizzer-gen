    "intro": "Lonicera monantha, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing plant native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in pairs, which emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. Its berries are red, fleshy, and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans. Lonicera monantha thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and fragrance."
