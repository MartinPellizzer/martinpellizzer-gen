    "intro": "Lobelia paludosa, commonly known as swamp lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in the presence of standing water. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear with a slightly wavy margin. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Lobelia paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
