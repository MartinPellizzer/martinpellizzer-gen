    "intro": "Lasiagrostis subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, pale blue to pink flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of water quality."
