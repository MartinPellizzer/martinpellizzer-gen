    "intro": "Lysimachia quadriflora, commonly known as four-flower chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has wiry, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Lysimachia quadriflora is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in damp meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
