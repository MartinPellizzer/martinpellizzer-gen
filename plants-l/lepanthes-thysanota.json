    "intro": "Lepanthes thysanota, commonly known as the feather-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and violet. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
