    "intro": "Lycopodium axillare, commonly known as the axillary clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves along its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Lycopodium axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover."
