    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bird's-foot trefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It has a low-growing habit with stems that can spread horizontally, forming dense mats. The leaves are finely divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance and making it easily identifiable in the wild."
