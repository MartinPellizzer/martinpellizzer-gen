It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium elegantulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
