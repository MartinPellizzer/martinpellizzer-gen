    "intro": "Lobelia giberroa var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its unique bracts, which are elongated and leaf-like, give it its specific variety name. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
