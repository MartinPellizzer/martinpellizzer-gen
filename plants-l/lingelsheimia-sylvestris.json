    "intro": "Lingelsheimia sylvestris, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its small, lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that reaches a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lingelsheimia sylvestris is considered a species of conservation concern."
