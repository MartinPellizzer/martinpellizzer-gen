It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes exogena is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
