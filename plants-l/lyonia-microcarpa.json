    "intro": "Lyonia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of hardwood forests. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
