    "intro": "Lactuca maculata, commonly known as spotted lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves with distinctive purple or reddish markings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a single umbel at the top of a slender stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas. Lactuca maculata is cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter flavor."
