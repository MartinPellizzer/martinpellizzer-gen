    "intro": "Laserpitium peucedanoides f. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved angel's trumpet, is a variant of the angel's trumpet plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant, bell-shaped blooms and aromatic foliage."
