    "intro": "Lactuca pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese lettuce or prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny structure on its stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe and is often found in disturbed soils. Lactuca pinnatifida is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
