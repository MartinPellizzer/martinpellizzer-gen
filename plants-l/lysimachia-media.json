    "intro": "Lysimachia media, commonly known as yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Lysimachia media thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
