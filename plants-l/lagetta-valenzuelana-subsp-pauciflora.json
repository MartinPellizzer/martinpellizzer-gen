    "intro": "Lagetta valenzuelana subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the Valenzuelan rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh, alpine conditions."
