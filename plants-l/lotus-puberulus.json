    "intro": "Lotus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, while its leaves provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Lotus puberulus is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
