    "intro": "Lepidaploa scorpioides, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soil. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Lepidaploa scorpioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
