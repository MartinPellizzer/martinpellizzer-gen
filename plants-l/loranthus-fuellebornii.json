    "intro": "Loranthus fuellebornii, commonly known as the Arizona mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on various species of oak trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant produces berries that are an important food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
