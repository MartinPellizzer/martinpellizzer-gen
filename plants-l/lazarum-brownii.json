It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Lazarum brownii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
