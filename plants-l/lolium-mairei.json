    "intro": "Lolium mairei, commonly known as the Maire's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Lolium mairei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
