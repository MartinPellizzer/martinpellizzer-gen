It consists of over 100 species, many of which are native to Asia, particularly China, India, and Southeast Asia. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are usually drupes, and some species are cultivated for their essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Litsea species are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological roles in various habitats."
