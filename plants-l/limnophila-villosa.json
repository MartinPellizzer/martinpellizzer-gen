It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in wetlands and shallow waters. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Limnophila villosa is often used in aquatic gardens and can thrive in pond environments with adequate sunlight and nutrient-rich water."
