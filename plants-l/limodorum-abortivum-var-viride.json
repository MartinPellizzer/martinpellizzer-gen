    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum var. viride, commonly known as the green-flowered larkspur, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually a pale green or white in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
