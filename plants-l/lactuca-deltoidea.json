    "intro": "Lactuca deltoidea, commonly known as delta lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of broad, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Lactuca deltoidea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
