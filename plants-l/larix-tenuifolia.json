    "intro": "Larix tenuifolia, commonly known as the Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release winged seeds in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing at high altitudes. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
