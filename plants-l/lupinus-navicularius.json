    "intro": "Lupinus navicularius, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Lupinus navicularius is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
