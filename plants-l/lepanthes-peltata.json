    "intro": "Lepanthes peltata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives as an epiphyte on tree bark. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Lepanthes peltata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
