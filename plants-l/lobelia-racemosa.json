    "intro": "Lobelia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in raceme-like clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite along the stem, and it thrives in moist, woodland environments. Lobelia racemosa is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
