    "intro": "Lonicera elisae, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically yellow or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera elisae is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
