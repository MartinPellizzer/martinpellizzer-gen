    "intro": "Lathyrus, commonly known as vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their climbing or trailing growth habit, often featuring tendrils that help them ascend supports. The flowers are typically pea-like, with a distinctive bilabiate structure, and come in a range of colors including purple, blue, and white. Lathyrus species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
