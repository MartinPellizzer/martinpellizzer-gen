    "intro": "Lotus riparius, commonly known as the water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the water's surface, with petals that range from white to pink. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are buoyant and often covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems extend upward to support the floral display. Lotus riparius plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
