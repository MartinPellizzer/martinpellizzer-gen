    "intro": "Lucuma jacquiniifolia, commonly known as the golden fruit tree, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters. The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp that is rich in nutrients. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Lucuma jacquiniifolia is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its edible fruit, which is used in traditional Andean cuisine."
