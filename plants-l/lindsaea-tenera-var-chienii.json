It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical regions of Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
