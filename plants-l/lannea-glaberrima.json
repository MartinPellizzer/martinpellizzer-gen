    "intro": "Lannea glaberrima, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often pale bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lannea glaberrima is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
