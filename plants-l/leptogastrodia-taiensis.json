    "intro": "Leptogastrodia taiensis, commonly known as the Taiwan leek orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of subtropical vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinct coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
