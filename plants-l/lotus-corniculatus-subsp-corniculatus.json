    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. corniculatus, commonly known as the common bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which often have a small, hooked spur at the end of each leaflet, resembling a bird's foot. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This species is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
