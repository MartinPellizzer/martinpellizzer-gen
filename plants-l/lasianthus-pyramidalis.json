    "intro": "Lasianthus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal flame bamboo, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that form a dense, pyramidal shape, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Lasianthus pyramidalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
