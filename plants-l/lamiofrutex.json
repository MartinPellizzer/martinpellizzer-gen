It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Lamiofrutex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
