    "intro": "Leptonychiopsis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of cup-like structure. The plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are native to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Leptonychiopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
