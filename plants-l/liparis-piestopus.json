    "intro": "Liparis piestopus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than traditional leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers with a delicate, fragrant scent, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
