    "intro": "Lechea laxiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically short and broad, adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to hot, dry environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy plant that can thrive in xeriscaped gardens."
