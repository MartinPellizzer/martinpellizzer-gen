    "intro": "Leersia ciliata, commonly known as the silky leersia, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Leersia ciliata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
