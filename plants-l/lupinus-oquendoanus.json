    "intro": "Lupinus oquendoanus, commonly known as the Oquendo lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, spindly growth habit and produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, typical of many members of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Lupinus oquendoanus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
