    "intro": "Lespedeza juncea var. glabrescens, commonly known as southernwood lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated legumes as fruits. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Lespedeza juncea var. glabrescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and its resilience to drought."
