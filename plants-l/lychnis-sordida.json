    "intro": "Lychnis sordida, commonly known as the stinking roseroot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
