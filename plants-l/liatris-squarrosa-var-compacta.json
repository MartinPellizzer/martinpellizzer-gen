    "intro": "Liatris squarrosa var. compacta, commonly known as the compact blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a desirable ornamental plant for gardens, while its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season."
