    "intro": "Lonicera angustifolia var. myrtillus, commonly known as the narrowleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. This variety is closely related to other honeysuckle species but is distinguished by its narrow foliage and specific habitat preferences."
