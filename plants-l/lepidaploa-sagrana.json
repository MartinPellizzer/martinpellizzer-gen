    "intro": "Lepidaploa sagrana, commonly known as the sagrana lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color and has a flat, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Xanthoria. It is often found growing on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in temperate regions. Lepidaploa sagrana is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
