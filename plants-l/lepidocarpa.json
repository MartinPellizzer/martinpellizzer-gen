It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, flat seeds. Lepidocarpa is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, and it can be invasive in certain regions."
