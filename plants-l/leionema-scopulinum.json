    "intro": "Leionema scopulinum, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often used in traditional M\u0101ori crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than on branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Leionema scopulinum is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its cultural significance in New Zealand's history."
