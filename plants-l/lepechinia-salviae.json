    "intro": "Lepechinia salviae, commonly known as the desert bluebelle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant produces small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lepechinia salviae is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
