It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage has a mild, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
