    "intro": "Lappula minuta, commonly known as small lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wetlands. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose spikes, and it produces slender, beak-like seed pods. Lappula minuta is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
