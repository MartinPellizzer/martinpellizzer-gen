It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lappula betpakdalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
