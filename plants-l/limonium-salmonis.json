    "intro": "Limonium salmonis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy and saline soils. Limonium salmonis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
