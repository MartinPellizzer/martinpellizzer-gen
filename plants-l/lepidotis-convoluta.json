It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
