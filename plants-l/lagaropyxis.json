    "intro": "Lagaropyxis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small showers, hence its common name. Lagaropyxis species are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm climates."
