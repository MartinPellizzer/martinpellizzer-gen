    "intro": "Lepanthes marta-herrae, commonly known as the Marta Herrae orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. This species is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display shades of purple and white, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in the ground, and relies on its host for support. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes marta-herrae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
