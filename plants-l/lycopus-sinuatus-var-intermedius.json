    "intro": "Lycopus sinuatus var. intermedius, commonly known as intermediate blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in association with other wetland plants. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
