    "intro": "Lespedeza juncea subsp. sericea, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a perennial forb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to mesic soils. Silky lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
