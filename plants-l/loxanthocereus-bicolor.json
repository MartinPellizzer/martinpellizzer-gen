    "intro": "Loxanthocereus bicolor, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments."
