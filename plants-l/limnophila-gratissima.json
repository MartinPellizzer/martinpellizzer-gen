    "intro": "Limnophila gratissima, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in water or moist soil, with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Limnophila gratissima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small insects and invertebrates."
