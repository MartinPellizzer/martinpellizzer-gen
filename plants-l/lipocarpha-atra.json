    "intro": "Lipocarpha atra, commonly known as the black marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomes help it thrive in saturated soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Lipocarpha atra is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
