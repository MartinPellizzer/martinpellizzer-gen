    "intro": "Laurentia, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Laurentia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance. They play a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
