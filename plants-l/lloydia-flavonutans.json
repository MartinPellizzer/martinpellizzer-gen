It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Lloydia flavonutans is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
