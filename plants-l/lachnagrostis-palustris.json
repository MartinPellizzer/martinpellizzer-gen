It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Lachnagrostis palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
