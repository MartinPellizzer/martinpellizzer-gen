    "intro": "Lindsaea neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the island of New Caledonia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant exhibits a typical fern morphology, with a rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, pinnate leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Lindsaea neocaledonica plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
