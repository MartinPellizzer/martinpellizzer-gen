It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a dense network of veins, which is a distinguishing feature. The flowers are often followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife."
