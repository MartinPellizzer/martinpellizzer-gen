    "intro": "Lomandra fibrata, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Lomandra fibrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native garden landscaping."
