    "intro": "Limonium popovii, commonly known as the Crimean sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Limonium popovii is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant often found in coastal dunes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
