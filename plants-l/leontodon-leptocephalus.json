    "intro": "Leontodon leptocephalus, commonly known as the slender-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Leontodon leptocephalus is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions."
