    "intro": "Leighia longifolia, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Leighia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by horticulturists for its beauty."
