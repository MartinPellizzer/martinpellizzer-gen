    "intro": "Lechea secundiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, elliptical leaves that store water, a key adaptation for survival in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains latex and is used by some insects for defense. Lechea secundiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
