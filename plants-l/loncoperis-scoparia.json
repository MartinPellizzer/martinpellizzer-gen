    "intro": "Loncoperis scoparia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods that release wind-dispersed seeds. Loncoperis scoparia is valued for its resilience and is often used in native plant landscaping and restoration projects."
