    "intro": "Lysias, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the genus Asclepias and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Lysias plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing both nectar and a host for their larvae. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable plant in native gardens and conservation efforts."
