It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus suevicus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
