    "intro": "Lecythis persistens subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces striking orange-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody fruits with a thick, leathery rind. Its seeds are encased in a hard, stony shell and are dispersed by animals that feed on the fruit. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
