    "intro": "Lupinus culbertsonii subsp. hypolasius, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of pea-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitat. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in desert scrublands."
