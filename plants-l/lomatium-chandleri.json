    "intro": "Lomatium chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's lomatium, is a member of the parsley family (Apiaceae) native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streamside areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal use, though it is not widely cultivated. Lomatium chandleri is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native insects and animals."
