    "intro": "Lunaria perennis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year producing showy blue-violet flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its papery, lens-shaped seed pods that split open to reveal tiny, shiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Lunaria perennis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
