    "intro": "Lactuca sativa subsp. crispa, commonly known as curly endive, is a leafy vegetable characterized by its crisp, slightly bitter leaves that form a loose head. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is closely related to lettuce and chicory. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with rosettes of dark green, curly leaves that are often harvested before flowering. It prefers cool climates and well-drained soil, and is commonly cultivated for its edible leaves. The leaves contain lactucine, a sesquiterpene lactone that contributes to its distinctive flavor and has mild medicinal properties."
