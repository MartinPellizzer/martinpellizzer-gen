    "intro": "Lobelia brandtii, commonly known as Brandt's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lobelia brandtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
