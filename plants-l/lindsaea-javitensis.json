It typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are characterized by their showy, tubular shape. Lindsaea javitensis is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
