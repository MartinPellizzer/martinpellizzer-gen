It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and bipinnate leaves. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The four-seeded variation refers to the number of seeds produced within each pod, distinguishing it from other lupine species."
