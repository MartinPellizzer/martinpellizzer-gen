    "intro": "Linum littorale var. glandulosum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in maritime environments and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
