It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of many leguminous species. Lupinus guadiloupensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
