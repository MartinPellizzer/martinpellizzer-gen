    "intro": "Lomandra marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Lomandra marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
