    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. gellivarana, commonly known as the Arctic twinflower, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the common twinflower. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shaded forest environments. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and subtle color variations compared to the typical form. It thrives in cool, moist habitats across northern regions, including parts of Canada and Alaska. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
