    "intro": "Luzula atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Luzula atlantica is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, humid climates."
