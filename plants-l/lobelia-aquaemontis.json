    "intro": "Lobelia aquaemontis, commonly known as the aquatic lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lobelia aquaemontis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
