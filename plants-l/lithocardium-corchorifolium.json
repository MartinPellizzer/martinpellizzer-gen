    "intro": "Lithocardium corchorifolium, commonly known as the coastal rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Lithocardium corchorifolium is often found in coastal dunes and limestone soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the landscape."
