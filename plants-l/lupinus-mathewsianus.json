It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
