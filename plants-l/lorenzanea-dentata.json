    "intro": "Lorenzanea dentata, commonly known as the toothed lorenzanea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule containing several small, hairy seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
