It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and distinctive yellow-orange fruits. The fruit, which resembles a small melon, contains a single large seed surrounded by a sweet, creamy pulp. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires a cool, temperate climate.
