    "intro": "Lappa bardana subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the European hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks. It contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
