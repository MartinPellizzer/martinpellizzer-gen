    "intro": "Lepidium graminifolium var. flexile, commonly known as slender peppergrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It has thin, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its seeds are small and have a hard coat, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
