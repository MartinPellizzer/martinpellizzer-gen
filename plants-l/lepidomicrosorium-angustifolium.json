    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Lepidomicrosorium angustifolium plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
