    "intro": "Lepidocoryphantha runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of desert ecosystems."
