    "intro": "Lepicephalus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the wet season. The orchid has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
