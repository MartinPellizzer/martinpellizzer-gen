It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of bright blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often hairy. Lupinus diehlii is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
