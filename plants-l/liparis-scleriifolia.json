    "intro": "Liparis scleriifolia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is typically yellow or orange. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Liparis scleriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
