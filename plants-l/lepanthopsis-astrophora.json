    "intro": "Lepanthopsis astrophora, commonly known as the starry orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive central spot. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
