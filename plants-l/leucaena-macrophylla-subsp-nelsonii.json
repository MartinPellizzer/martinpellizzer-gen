    "intro": "Leucaena macrophylla subsp. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in revegetation projects due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and agroforestry."
