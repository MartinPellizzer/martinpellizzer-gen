    "intro": "Lithops dinteri var. multipunctata, commonly known as the \"pebble plant,\" is a succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a compact, rock-like appearance with two closely fused stems that resemble small stones. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which emerge from between the leaf pairs. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Lithops dinteri var. multipunctata is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and collections."
