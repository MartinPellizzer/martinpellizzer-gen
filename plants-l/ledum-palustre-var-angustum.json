    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a distinctive minty aroma. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries."
