    "intro": "Lycium serpyllifolium, commonly known as creeping boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
