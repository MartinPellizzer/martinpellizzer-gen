    "intro": "Lantana camara f. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered lantana, is a compact shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from red to orange in color, typically blooming in clusters throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and livestock. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation."
