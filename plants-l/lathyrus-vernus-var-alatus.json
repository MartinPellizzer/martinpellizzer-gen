    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus var. alatus, commonly known as the winged vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive winged pods. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
