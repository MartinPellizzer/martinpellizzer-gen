    "intro": "Lobivia albicentra, commonly known as the White-Centered Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive white or pale green center, contrasting with its dark green outer ribs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Lobivia albicentra is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
