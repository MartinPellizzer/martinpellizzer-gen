    "intro": "Lycium johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Lycium johnstonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
