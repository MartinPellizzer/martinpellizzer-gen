It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in coastal and sandy habitats. It is well adapted to saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
