    "intro": "Lupinus lindenianus, commonly known as the Lindheimer's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has palmately divided leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus lindenianus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
