    "intro": "Linum sibiricum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the Siberian flax, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are a source of oil and fiber. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other flax species but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
