    "intro": "Lolium complanatum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has narrow, flat leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. Bentgrass is valued for its fine texture and is commonly used in golf course fairways and ornamental landscapes."
