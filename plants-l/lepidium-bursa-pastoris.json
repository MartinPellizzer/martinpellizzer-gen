    "intro": "Lepidium bursa-pastoris, commonly known as field peppergrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in branched inflorescences, and its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive lobed or divided shape. The plant produces small, triangular seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a mechanism known as explosive dehiscence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
