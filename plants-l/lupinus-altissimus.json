    "intro": "Lupinus altissimus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Lupinus altissimus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
