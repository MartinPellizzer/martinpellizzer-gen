    "intro": "Limoniodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and water. Limoniodes thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in swampy areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
