It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Liparis eggersii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
