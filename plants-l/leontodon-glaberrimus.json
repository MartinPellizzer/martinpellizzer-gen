    "intro": "Leontodon glaberrimus, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with dense, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leontodon glaberrimus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
