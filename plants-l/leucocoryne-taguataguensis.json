    "intro": "Leucocoryne taguataguensis, commonly known as the Taguata Guenine lily, is a bulbous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green throat, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
