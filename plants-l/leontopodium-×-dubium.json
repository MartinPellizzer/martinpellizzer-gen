    "intro": "Leontopodium \u00d7 dubium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and endurance. Due to its restricted range and conservation status, it is protected in many regions."
