It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Lactuca sibirica is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
