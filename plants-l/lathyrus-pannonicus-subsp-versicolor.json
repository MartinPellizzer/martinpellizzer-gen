    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable pea vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet, with a distinctive spurred petal, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its variability in flower color and leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
