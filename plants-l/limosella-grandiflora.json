    "intro": "Limosella grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh coastal conditions. Limosella grandiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
