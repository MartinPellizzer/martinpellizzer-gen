    "intro": "Lastrea nephrolepidioides, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of root hairs. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
