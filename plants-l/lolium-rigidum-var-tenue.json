    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. tenue, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including pastures, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. This variety is often used in forage and erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
