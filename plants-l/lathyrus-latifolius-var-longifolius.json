    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. longifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
