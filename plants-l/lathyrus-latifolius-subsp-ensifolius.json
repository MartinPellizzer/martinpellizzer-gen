    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius subsp. ensifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often lobed, and its clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped legumes as fruits, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
