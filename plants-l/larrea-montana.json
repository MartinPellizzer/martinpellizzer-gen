    "intro": "Larrea montana, commonly known as grevillea, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and leathery, aromatic leaves. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers are often visited by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Larrea montana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in some cultures."
