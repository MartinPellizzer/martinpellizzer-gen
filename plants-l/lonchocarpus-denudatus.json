    "intro": "Lonchocarpus denudatus, commonly known as the naked fruit legume, is a tropical plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, pod-like fruits that are typically smooth and hairless. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility."
