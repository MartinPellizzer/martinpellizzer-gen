    "intro": "Lythrum flexuosum, commonly known as swamp willow or redroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, flexible stems that often trail along the ground, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, spike-like clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in tannins and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Lythrum flexuosum thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
