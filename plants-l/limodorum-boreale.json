    "intro": "Limodorum boreale, commonly known as the northern lily or white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Limodorum boreale is notable for its ability to thrive in cool climates and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
