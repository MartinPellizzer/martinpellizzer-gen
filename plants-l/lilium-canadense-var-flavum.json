    "intro": "Lilium canadense var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow Canada lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with long, grass-like leaves arranged in a fan shape. Its bulbous roots are adapted for storing nutrients, supporting its growth in moist, woodland environments. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
