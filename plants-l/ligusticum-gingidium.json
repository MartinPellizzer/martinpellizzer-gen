It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum gingidium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments."
