    "intro": "Lolium annuum, commonly known as annual ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which develop into seeds. Annual ryegrass is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. It is also an important weed in agricultural fields, particularly in crops like corn and soybeans."
