    "intro": "Lindsaea merrillii subsp. yaeyamensis, commonly known as Yaeyama lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
