    "intro": "Lepidium campestre subsp. hirtum, commonly known as hairy field cress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing stature, with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
