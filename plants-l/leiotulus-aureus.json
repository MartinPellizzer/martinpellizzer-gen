    "intro": "Leiotulus aureus, commonly known as the golden dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
