    "intro": "Loranthus globifer var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found on acacia and eucalyptus species. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries it produces are red or orange and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds."
