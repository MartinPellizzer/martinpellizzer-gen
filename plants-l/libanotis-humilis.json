    "intro": "Libanotis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf libanotis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a valued addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
