    "intro": "Lolium strictum proles humile, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many temperate regions."
