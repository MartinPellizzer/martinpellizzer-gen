    "intro": "Loranthus heteromorphus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a unique life cycle, with seeds dispersed by birds that consume its fleshy, red berries. It is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on its host trees and the surrounding environment."
