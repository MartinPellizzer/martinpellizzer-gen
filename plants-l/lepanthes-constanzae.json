    "intro": "Lepanthes constanzae, commonly known as the Constanza's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a mix of white and purple hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its blossoms often bloom during the rainy season, adding to the biodiversity of its humid, misty habitat. Lepanthes constanzae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral structure."
