It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces bulbous underground stems, which contribute to its name and allow it to store nutrients for future growth. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its size and beauty, it is a prized ornamental plant in gardens and botanical collections."
