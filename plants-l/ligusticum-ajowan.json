    "intro": "Ligusticum ajowan, commonly known as Persian cumin, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as schizocarps, which contain the aromatic seeds used in cooking and traditional medicine. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong, pungent aroma and medicinal properties. Ligusticum ajowan is valued for its use in both culinary and therapeutic applications due to its unique chemical composition."
