    "intro": "Lastrea villosa, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
