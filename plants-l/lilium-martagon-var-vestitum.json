    "intro": "Lilium martagon var. vestitum, commonly known as the Turk's\u5e3d lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. This variety is known for its unique, recurved petals that give it a distinctive, almost crown-like shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
