    "intro": "Laurus nobilis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved laurel, is a cultivar of the bay laurel plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard Laurus nobilis. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental use. Its leaves have a strong aromatic scent and are used in cooking, similar to the common bay leaf. The flowers are small and yellowish-green, appearing in spring, followed by small, dark blue berries."
