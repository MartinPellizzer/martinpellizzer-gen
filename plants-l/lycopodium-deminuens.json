    "intro": "Lycopodium deminuens, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium deminuens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage traces back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living relic of early plant evolution."
