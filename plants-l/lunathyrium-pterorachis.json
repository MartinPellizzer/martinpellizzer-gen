    "intro": "Lunathyrium pterorachis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is typically slow, requiring well-drained soil and a cool, humid environment to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
