    "intro": "Lavandula antineae subsp. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti lavender, is a subspecies native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. This resilient plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal uses."
