It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium spachianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
