It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright stems covered in grayish-white pubescence. The leaves are elliptical, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a bluish-green hue on top and a pale underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories."
