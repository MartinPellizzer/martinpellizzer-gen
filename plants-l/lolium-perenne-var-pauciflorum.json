    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the lesser perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is a distinguishing feature of the pauciflorum variant. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are usually dispersed by wind or through animal activity. It is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
