    "intro": "Lomatium kingii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the parsley family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
