    "intro": "Lomelosia isetensis, commonly known as the Iseten lomelosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomelosia isetensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
