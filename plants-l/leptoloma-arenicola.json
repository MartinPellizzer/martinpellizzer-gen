    "intro": "Leptoloma arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill puffball, is a small, non-photosynthetic fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants. It is typically found in sandy soils, often associated with grasses and other low-growing vegetation. The fungus produces a distinctive, white, spherical fruiting body that becomes dry and brittle as it matures. It plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter in its habitat. Due to its specialized environment, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
