    "intro": "Leucas gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum leucas, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, saline soils, particularly those containing gypsum. Its small, daisy-like flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Leucas gypsicola is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
