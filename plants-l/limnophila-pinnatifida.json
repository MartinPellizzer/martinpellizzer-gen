    "intro": "Limnophila pinnatifida, commonly known as water thyme, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Pontederiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces bright blue or purple flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Limnophila pinnatifida is often used in aquatic landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats."
