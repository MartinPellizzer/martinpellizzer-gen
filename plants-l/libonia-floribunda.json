    "intro": "Libonia floribunda, commonly known as the flowering libonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Libonia floribunda is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
