    "intro": "Leucocroton revolutus, commonly known as the silver-leaved croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
