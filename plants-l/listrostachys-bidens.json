    "intro": "Listrostachys bidens, commonly known as the common burrweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by the characteristic burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth and persistent seeds, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
