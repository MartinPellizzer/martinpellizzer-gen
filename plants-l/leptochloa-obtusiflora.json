    "intro": "Leptochloa obtusiflora, commonly known as broad-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in lowland areas with high humidity. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets with short, blunt bracts. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, and it relies on wind for pollination. Leptochloa obtusiflora is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
