    "intro": "Lindera glauca var. parvifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its fragrant foliage and ornamental appeal. The variety is distinguished by its smaller, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Lindera glauca."
