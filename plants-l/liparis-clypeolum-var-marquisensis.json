It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
