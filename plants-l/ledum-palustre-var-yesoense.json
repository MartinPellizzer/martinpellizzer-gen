    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. yesoense, commonly known as the Yesoese Labrador tea, is a variant of the broad-leafed Labrador tea native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, leathery, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. This variant is notable for its medicinal uses by indigenous peoples, who have traditionally used it for its antiseptic and analgesic properties."
