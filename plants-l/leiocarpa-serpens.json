    "intro": "Leiocarpa serpens, commonly known as the serpentine lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in nutrient-poor, often calcareous soils, particularly in temperate regions. The plant forms a dense, foliose thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. Its growth is slow, and it is often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The species is notable for its ability to colonize harsh environments, making it an important indicator of soil conditions."
