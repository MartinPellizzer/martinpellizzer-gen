    "intro": "Linzia usafuensis, commonly known as the Usafu sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Linzia usafuensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
