    "intro": "Lobelia paniculata, commonly known as the panicled lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Lobelia paniculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
