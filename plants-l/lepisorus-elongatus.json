    "intro": "Lepisorus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense mats on the water's surface or along the substrate. Lepisorus elongatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
