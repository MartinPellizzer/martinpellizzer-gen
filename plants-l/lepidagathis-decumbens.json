    "intro": "Lepidagathis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping lepidagathis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and the plant produces small, dry fruits containing seeds."
