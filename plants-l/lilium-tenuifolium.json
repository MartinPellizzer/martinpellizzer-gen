    "intro": "Lilium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, brown capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lilium tenuifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
