    "intro": "Lastrea bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
