It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in the spring. Loasa mollensis thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
