    "intro": "Loranthus obvallatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing as a partial parasite on various woody plants."
