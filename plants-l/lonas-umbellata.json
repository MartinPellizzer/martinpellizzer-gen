It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is often enclosed by the colorful spathe.

The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
