    "intro": "Ligustrum glomeratum, commonly known as clustered privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum glomeratum is also valued for its ability to tolerate pruning, making it suitable for hedges and topiary."
