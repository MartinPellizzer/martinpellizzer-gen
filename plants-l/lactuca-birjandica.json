    "intro": "Lactuca birjandica, commonly known as the Birjand lettuce, is a rare species native to Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in composite inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
