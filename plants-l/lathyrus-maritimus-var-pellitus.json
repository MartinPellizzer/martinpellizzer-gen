    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus var. pellitus, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for coastal erosion control. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores."
