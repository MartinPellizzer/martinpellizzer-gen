    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
