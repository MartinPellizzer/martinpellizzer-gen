    "intro": "Lantana hirsuta subsp. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian lantana, is a shrub native to South America, particularly the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, which are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
