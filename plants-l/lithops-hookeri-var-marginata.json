    "intro": "Lithops hookeri var. marginata, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features two fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branching stem with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its unique appearance mimics surrounding rocks, providing effective camouflage. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
