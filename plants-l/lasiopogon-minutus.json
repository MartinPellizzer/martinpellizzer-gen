    "intro": "Lasiopogon minutus, commonly known as the minute leafhopper, is a small, slender insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its tiny size, typically measuring less than 5 millimeters in length, and its delicate, often green or brown body. This plant-feeding insect is primarily found on grasses and other low-growing vegetation, where it feeds on plant sap. Its wings are usually transparent or lightly colored, and it has a distinctive, narrow body shape. Lasiopogon minutus plays a minor role in plant ecosystems, mainly as a herbivore and a potential vector for plant pathogens."
