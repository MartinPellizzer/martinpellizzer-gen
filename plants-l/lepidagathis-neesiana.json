The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue and are clustered in dense, umbel-like inflorescences. Lepidagathis neesiana is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
