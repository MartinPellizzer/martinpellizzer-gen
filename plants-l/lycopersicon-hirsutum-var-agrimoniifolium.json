    "intro": "Lycopersicon hirsutum var. agrimoniifolium, commonly known as the wild tomato or agrimony-leaved tomato, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features hairy stems and lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a close relative to the domesticated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. It is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
