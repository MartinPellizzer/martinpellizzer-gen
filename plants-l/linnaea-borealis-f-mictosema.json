    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. mictosema, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a rare and diminutive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a deciduous shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. The plant features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in pairs. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy, dark green appearance. This form is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
