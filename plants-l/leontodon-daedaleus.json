    "intro": "Leontodon daedaleus, commonly known as the fairy ring grass or the devil's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tufted growth habit and small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it forms dense clumps that can create a striking visual effect in the landscape. Leontodon daedaleus is also known for its ability to form fairy rings, which are circular patches of dense vegetation often associated with mycorrhizal fungi."
