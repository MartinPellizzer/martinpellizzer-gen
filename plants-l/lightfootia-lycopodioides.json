    "intro": "Lightfootia lycopodioides, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, spiky appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Lightfootia lycopodioides reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
