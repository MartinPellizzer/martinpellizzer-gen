    "intro": "Lodhra sumuntia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Eastern Himalayas, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Nepal and India. It features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often submerged, with a waxy texture that helps it float. Its root system is extensive, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lodhra sumuntia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
