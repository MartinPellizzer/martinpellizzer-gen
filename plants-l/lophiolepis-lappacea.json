    "intro": "Lophiolepis lappacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rocks and tree bark in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
