    "intro": "Leucopogon psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited to harsh coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray. Leucopogon psammophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
