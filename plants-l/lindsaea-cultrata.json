    "intro": "Lindsaea cultrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its sporangia are clustered in spiky structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Lindsaea cultrata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the understory vegetation in humid forests."
