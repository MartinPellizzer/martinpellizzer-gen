    "intro": "Lobomon obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lobemon, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are characterized by their obtuse (blunt) tips and serrated edges, which aid in water retention. Lobomon obtusifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
