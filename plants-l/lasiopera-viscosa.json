    "intro": "Lasiopera viscosa, commonly known as the sticky lasiopera, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky resin. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The sticky resin on its leaves is a unique botanical feature that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
