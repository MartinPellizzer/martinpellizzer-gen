    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. russellianum, commonly known as Russell's perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine blades, tufted growth habit, and dense foliage, making it a desirable forage crop. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass mixes and pasturelands due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment. Its ability to persist under grazing and its tolerance to moderate drought conditions contribute to its agricultural importance."
