    "intro": "Lachnaea macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered lichen, is a member of the family Lachnaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal component and algal or cyanobacterial partners. The plant exhibits a crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called apothecia, are small and often embedded within the thallus. Lachnaea macrantha is found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in environments with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
