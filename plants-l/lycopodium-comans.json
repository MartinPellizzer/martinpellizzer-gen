    "intro": "Lycopodium comans, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium comans thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
