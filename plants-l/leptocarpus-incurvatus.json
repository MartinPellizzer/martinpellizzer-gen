It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of salinity. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in coastal vegetation."
