    "intro": "Lecanorchis japonica var. insularis, commonly known as the Ryukyu orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. This variety is part of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
