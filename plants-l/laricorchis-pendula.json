    "intro": "Laricorchis pendula, commonly known as the hanging tassel orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pendulous inflorescences with small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
