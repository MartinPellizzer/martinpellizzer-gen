The plant is characterized by its woody structure, palmate leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited ecological and botanical study."
