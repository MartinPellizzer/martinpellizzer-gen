    "intro": "Lycaste virginalis var. armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant produces a fragrant, pendulous inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
