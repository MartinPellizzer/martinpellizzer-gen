    "intro": "Lindernia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lindernia, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are showy, with two-lipped, tubular blossoms that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and moist woodland settings. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
