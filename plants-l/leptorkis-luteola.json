    "intro": "Leptorkis luteola, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is yellowish-green, and it features a distinct, leaf-like structure with a central axis. It is characterized by its ability to produce a yellowish to orange pigment, which contributes to its common name. This lichen is often found in shaded, moist environments and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution."
