    "intro": "Loranthus quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a haustellum, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with five distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. The berries it bears are red and fleshy, serving as a food source for birds and other animals."
