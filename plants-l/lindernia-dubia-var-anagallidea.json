It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The species is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
