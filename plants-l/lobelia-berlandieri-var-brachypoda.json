    "intro": "Lobelia berlandieri var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
