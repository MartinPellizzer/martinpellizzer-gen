It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smaller and more delicate than those of the standard Lonicera etrusca. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is characterized by long, flexible stems that can twine around supports. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
