    "intro": "Liparis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-caped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Liparis breviscapa is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
