    "intro": "Leighia silphioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
