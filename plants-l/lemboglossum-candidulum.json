    "intro": "Lemboglossum candidulum, commonly known as the white lemboglossum, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowering period is usually during the rainy season, which aligns with the availability of its specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lemboglossum candidulum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
