    "intro": "Lycium scabrum, commonly known as prickly gooseberry, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The berries are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in local cuisines or traditional medicine."
