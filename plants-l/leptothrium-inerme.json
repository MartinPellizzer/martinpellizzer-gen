    "intro": "Leptothrium inerme, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in forested areas or on cliffs. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a lanceolate shape. Its spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Leptothrium inerme is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
