    "intro": "Leptorhabdos glutinosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to arid conditions. The sticky texture of its leaves is a defense mechanism against herbivores and excessive moisture loss."
