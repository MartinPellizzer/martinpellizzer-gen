    "intro": "Lyroglossa pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-tongued lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy appearance on the thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a crustose growth, typically found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate and subarctic regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Lyroglossa pubicaulis is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
