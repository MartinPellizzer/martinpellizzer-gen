It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and prefers cool, bright conditions with good air circulation. Its roots are adapted to thrive in well-draining, loose soil, and it is often cultivated as a miniature orchid in greenhouses or terrariums. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts."
