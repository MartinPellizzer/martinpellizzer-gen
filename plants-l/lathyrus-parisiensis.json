    "intro": "Lathyrus parisiensis, commonly known as the Paris pea or French bean, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lathyrus parisiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
