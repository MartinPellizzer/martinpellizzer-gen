It typically features trifoliate leaves with varying leaflet shapes, which contribute to its varietal name \"heterophylla.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
