    "intro": "Lissochilus galbanus, commonly known as the golden chile or golden bell, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
