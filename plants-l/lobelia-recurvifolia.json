    "intro": "Lobelia recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often recurved at the edges, giving it its common name. Lobelia recurvifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
