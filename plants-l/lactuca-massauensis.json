    "intro": "Lactuca massauensis, commonly known as the Massaouene lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to regions of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, similar to other lettuce species. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Lactuca massauensis is valued for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste and are used in local cuisines."
