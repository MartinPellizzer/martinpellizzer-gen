    "intro": "Leptopoda, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Psilotales. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead having small, scale-like structures called enations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptopoda has a simple, unbranched stem that bears sporangia at the nodes. Its unique morphology reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage within the plant kingdom."
