    "intro": "Lastrea rivoirei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and narrow, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with warm, dry climates."
