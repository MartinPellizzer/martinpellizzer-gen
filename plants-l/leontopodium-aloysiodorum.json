    "intro": "Leontopodium aloysiodorum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by soft, silky bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the rocky landscapes it inhabits. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many areas."
