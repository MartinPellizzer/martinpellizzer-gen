It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The berries are a food source for birds and are also used in traditional herbal medicine."
