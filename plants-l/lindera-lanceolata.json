    "intro": "Lindera lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf Lindera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Lindera lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
