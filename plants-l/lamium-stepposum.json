It typically features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. Lamium stepposum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas."
