    "intro": "Liparis henrici, commonly known as the Henry's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Liparis henrici is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
