    "intro": "Leontice brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted leontice, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheats and sorrels, and is characterized by its distinctive, slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in early spring, typically before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
