    "intro": "Leptospermum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to Tasmania and parts of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is also cultivated for its aromatic properties. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil types."
