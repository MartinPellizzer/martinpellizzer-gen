It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism similar to that of a burr. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
