    "intro": "Lomaridium contiguum, commonly known as the coastal lomaridium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Lomaridium contiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
