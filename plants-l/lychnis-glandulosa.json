    "intro": "Lychnis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Lychnis glandulosa is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes."
