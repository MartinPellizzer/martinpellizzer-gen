    "intro": "Ligustrum compactum, commonly known as the dense privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum compactum is also valued for its ability to tolerate pruning, making it suitable for hedges and topiaries."
