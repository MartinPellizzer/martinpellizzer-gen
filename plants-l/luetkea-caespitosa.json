    "intro": "Luetkea caespitosa, commonly known as the purple tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright purple flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Luetkea caespitosa thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native habitats."
