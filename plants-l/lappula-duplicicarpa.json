    "intro": "Lappula duplicicarpa, commonly known as the two-seeded lappula, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a specialized structure called an utricle, which aids in seed dispersal. Lappula duplicicarpa is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
