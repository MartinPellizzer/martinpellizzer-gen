    "intro": "Leptodermis coriaceifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved daisies, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
