    "intro": "Limnophila cavaleriei, commonly known as the water thyme, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in rice paddies and wetlands. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. Limnophila cavaleriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water garden settings."
