    "intro": "Lomandra rigida, commonly known as the rigid lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Lomandra rigida is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for native wildlife."
