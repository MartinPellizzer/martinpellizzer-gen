    "intro": "Lastrea latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flattened, leaf-like body that is often segmented into lobes. Its reproductive structures, called gametophytes, are distinct and play a key role in its life cycle. Lastrea latifrons is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
