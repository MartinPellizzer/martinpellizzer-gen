    "intro": "Lyonia squamulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf lyonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, scale-like structures that give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. Lyonia squamulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
