    "intro": "Ligustrum mellosum, commonly known as the Mello's privet, is a species of flowering plant in the Oleaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some animals. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum mellosum prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
