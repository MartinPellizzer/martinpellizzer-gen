    "intro": "Luma multiflora, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Luma multiflora is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
