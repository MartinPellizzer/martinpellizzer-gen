    "intro": "Lathyrus pubescens var. normalis, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to twine around supports. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Lathyrus pubescens var. normalis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting neighboring plants."
