    "intro": "Lecanopteris vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
