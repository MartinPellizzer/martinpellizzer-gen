    "intro": "Lathraea quinquefida, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of other plants, such as orchids, to absorb nutrients and water. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with small, fleshy structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's roots. It is native to southern Africa and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a specialized ecological role in its habitat."
