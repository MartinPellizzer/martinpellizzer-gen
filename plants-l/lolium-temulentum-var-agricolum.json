    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. agricolum, commonly known as barley grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along riverbanks. Due to its high nutritional content, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or in herbal remedies."
