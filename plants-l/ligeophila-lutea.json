    "intro": "Ligeophila lutea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a complex interrelationship between fungal and algal components. The plant's structure includes a loosely branched, leaf-like body that is often covered in a thin, crusty layer. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
