    "intro": "Lecanopteris carnosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
