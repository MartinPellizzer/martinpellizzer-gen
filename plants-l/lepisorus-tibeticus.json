    "intro": "Lepisorus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan lip fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. Native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas, it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizome is short and creeping, with numerous roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal in its natural habitat."
