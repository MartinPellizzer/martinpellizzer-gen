    "intro": "Lathyrus luteus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with smooth, ovate leaflets that give the plant its \"laevigatus\" designation, meaning smooth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
