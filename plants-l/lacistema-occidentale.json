    "intro": "Lacistema occidentale, commonly known as the western lacistema, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of North America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces violet-colored berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them harmful if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
