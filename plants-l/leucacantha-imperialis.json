    "intro": "Leucacantha imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial Whitebell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
