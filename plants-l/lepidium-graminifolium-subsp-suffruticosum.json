    "intro": "Lepidium graminifolium subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping peppergrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It has slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats."
