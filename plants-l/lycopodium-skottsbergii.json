It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium skottsbergii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
