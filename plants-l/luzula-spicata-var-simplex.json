    "intro": "Luzula spicata var. simplex, commonly known as the slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a tight cluster, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The variety *simplex* is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and less branched inflorescences compared to other forms of *Luzula spicata*."
