    "intro": "Loranthus tenuisepalus, commonly known as the slender-caleda shrub, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Eucalyptus genus, through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a waxy coating. Loranthus tenuisepalus is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats."
