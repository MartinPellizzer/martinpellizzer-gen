    "intro": "Liparis acaulis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and lack of a pseudobulb. The plant typically produces a single or few erect, lance-shaped leaves and a single flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
