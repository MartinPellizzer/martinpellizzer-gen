    "intro": "Lupinus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Lupinus flavescens is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
