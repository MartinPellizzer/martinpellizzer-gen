    "intro": "Lotononis carnosa subsp. condensata, commonly known as the dense lotononis, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
