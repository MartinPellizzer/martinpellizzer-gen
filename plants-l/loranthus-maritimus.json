    "intro": "Loranthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in coastal and maritime regions. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which are specialized structures that connect to the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often red or yellow, containing seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological role, Loranthus maritimus is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
