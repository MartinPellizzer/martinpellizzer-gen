    "intro": "Leucas dimidiata, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its milky sap, typical of the milkweed genus, is a distinguishing feature. Leucas dimidiata is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
