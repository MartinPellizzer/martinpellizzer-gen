    "intro": "Lathyrus basalticus, commonly known as the basaltic vetch, is a perennial legume native to the volcanic regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Lathyrus basalticus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
