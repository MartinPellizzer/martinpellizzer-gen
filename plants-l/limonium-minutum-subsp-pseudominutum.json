It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate mild drought conditions. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal gardens."
