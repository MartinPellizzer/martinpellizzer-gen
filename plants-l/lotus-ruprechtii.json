    "intro": "Lotus ruprechtii, commonly known as the Himalayan lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged, while its flowers rise above the water. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires nutrient-rich, alkaline waters for optimal growth. The lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various regions of Asia."
