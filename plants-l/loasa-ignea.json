    "intro": "Loasa ignea, commonly known as the firebush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red tubular flowers, which are attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. Loasa ignea thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its botanical name reflects its fiery appearance, with \"ignea\" meaning fire in Latin."
