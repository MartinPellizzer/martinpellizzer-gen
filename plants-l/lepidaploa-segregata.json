    "intro": "Lepidaploa segregata, commonly known as the Sierra lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a lack of a true rhizome, which is typical of some members of the lily family. Lepidaploa segregata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
