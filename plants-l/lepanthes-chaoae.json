It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns and a unique structure that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
