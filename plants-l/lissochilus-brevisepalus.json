It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora."
