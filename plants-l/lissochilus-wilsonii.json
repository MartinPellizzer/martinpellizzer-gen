    "intro": "Lissochilus wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and requires cool, humid conditions to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its mountainous habitat. The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
