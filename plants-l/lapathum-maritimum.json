    "intro": "Lapathum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and other maritime habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Lapathum maritimum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
