    "intro": "Lunaria graeca, commonly known as the Greek moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, orb-shaped flowers that resemble small moons, typically appearing in shades of white or pale blue. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open to reveal glossy, coin-like seeds, which are a distinctive feature. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Lunaria graeca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
