    "intro": "Leucospermum zeyheri, commonly known as the firewheel bush, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flower heads that resemble wheels, hence its common name. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It blooms throughout the year, with peak flowering during the warmer months, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Leucospermum zeyheri is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils, making it a popular choice in garden landscapes."
