    "intro": "Limodorum altum, commonly known as the tall lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in shades of white to pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Limodorum altum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and historical significance in herbal medicine."
