    "intro": "Lesquerella kingii var. sherwoodii, commonly known as the Sherwood lesquerella, is a rare and endangered plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of elongated, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, including the presence of lesquerolic acid, which has attracted interest for potential industrial applications. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
