    "intro": "Lotus nevadensis var. douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's lotus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. It is a perennial herb with distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is considered a sensitive species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and climate change."
