    "intro": "Lycopodiella cernua var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. This variant is native to the Himalayan region, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan."
