    "intro": "Labordia tinifolia var. honolulensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian milkweed, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a shrub characterized by its hairy, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
