    "intro": "Lonchocarpus berriozabalensis, commonly known as the Brazilian stranglewood, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and climbing habit. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are elliptical in shape. Due to the presence of toxic compounds, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling."
