It produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are sturdy and upright. Lilium luteum is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped blooms that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
