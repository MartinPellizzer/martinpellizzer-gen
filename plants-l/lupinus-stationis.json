It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus stationis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
