    "intro": "Leontodon infestus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy blue or purple flowers in early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, bell-like heads, which give it its common name. The plant is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover in its native habitats."
