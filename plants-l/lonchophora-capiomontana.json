    "intro": "Lonchophora capiomontana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
