    "intro": "Lupinus jonesii, commonly known as Jones' lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Lupinus jonesii plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
