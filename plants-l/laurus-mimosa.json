    "intro": "Laurus mimosa, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that close when touched, a response triggered by touch-sensitive cells. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its botanical features make it a unique and visually striking plant in gardens and natural habitats."
