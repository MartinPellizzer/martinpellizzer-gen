    "intro": "Lonchocarpus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic senna, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
