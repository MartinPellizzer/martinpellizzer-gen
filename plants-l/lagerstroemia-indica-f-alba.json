    "intro": "Lagerstroemia indica f. alba, commonly known as the white crape myrtle, is a cultivar of the crape myrtle plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fluffy white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its bark is smooth and mottled, becoming more textured with age, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The white crape myrtle is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to many common pests and diseases."
