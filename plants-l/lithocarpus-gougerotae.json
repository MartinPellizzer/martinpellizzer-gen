    "intro": "Lithocarpus gougerotae, commonly known as the Gougerot's ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, nut-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
