    "intro": "Lycianthes, commonly known as the \"wild pepper\" or \"cup-of-soup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lycianthes species typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Some species produce edible fruits, though they are not as widely cultivated as other nightshades like tomatoes or peppers."
