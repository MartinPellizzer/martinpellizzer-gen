It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, followed by edible fruits that are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky outcrops. Livistona jenkinsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
