It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves that emit a citrus-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, orange-red fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and fruits, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
