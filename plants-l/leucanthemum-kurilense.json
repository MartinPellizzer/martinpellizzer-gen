    "intro": "Leucanthemum kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Kuril Islands and parts of eastern Siberia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
