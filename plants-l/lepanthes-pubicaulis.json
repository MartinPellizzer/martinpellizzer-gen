    "intro": "Lepanthes pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features hairy structures on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
