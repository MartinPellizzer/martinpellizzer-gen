    "intro": "Loranthus balfourianus, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host, which can sometimes lead to weakened growth in the host tree. Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus balfourianus plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine."
