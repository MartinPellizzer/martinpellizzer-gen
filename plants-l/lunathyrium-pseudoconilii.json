    "intro": "Lunathyrium pseudoconilii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, night-blooming flowers that open in response to darkness and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
