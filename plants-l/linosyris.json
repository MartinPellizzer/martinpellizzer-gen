    "intro": "Linosyris, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often submerged or floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. Linosyris species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. They exhibit a unique photosynthetic adaptation, with some species capable of performing both photosynthesis and carnivory. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
