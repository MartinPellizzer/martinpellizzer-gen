    "intro": "Lycopodioides lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
