    "intro": "Lepterica, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture. Lepterica species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
