    "intro": "Linkia rudis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to marine environments. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy shores. Linkia rudis is an important species for both ecological and cultural reasons in its native habitats."
