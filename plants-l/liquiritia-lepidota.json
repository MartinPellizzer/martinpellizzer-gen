    "intro": "Liquiritia lepidota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved licorice, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its root, which contains glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
