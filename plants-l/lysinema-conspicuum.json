    "intro": "Lysinema conspicuum, commonly known as the showy lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the roots of its host plants to absorb nutrients. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lysinema conspicuum is often found in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
