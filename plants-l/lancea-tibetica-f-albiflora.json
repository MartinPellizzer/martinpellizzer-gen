    "intro": "Lancea tibetica f. albiflora, commonly known as the Tibetan whiteflower lancea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
