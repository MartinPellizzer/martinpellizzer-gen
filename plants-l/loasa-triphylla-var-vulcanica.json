It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique botanical features, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
