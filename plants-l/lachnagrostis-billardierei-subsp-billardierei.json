    "intro": "Lachnagrostis billardierei subsp. billardierei, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
