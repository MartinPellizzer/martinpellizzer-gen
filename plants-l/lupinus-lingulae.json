    "intro": "Lupinus lingulae, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus lingulae is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
