    "intro": "Lycium ciliatum var. cordobense, commonly known as the Cordoba boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
