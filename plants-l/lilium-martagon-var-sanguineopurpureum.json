The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with a soft, velvety texture and a subtle fragrance. This variety is notable for its unique coloration, which transitions from a deep red at the base to a pale pink at the tips. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
