    "intro": "Lysiphyllum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved sea fan, is a unique marine plant found in shallow tropical waters. It belongs to the order Pennatae and is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcareous skeletal elements. The plant exhibits a dual-leaved morphology, with distinct upper and lower leaf surfaces that aid in photosynthesis. It plays a crucial role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and pollution."
