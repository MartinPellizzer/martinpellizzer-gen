    "intro": "Leucheria tenerifolia, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
