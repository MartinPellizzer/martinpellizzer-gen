    "intro": "Lepidium lasiocarpum var. tenuipes, commonly known as the slender-leaved peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and yellow flowers. It produces small, cylindrical fruits called siliques, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures. This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
