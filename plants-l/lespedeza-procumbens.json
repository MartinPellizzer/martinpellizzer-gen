    "intro": "Lespedeza procumbens, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are opposite and have a soft, feathery texture. Creeping lespedeza is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
