    "intro": "Lupulus, commonly known as hops, is a flowering plant in the family Humulus, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its cones, or hop cones, contain lupulin, a substance responsible for its characteristic bitter flavor and aromatic properties. The plant is cultivated primarily for use in brewing beer, where it imparts bitterness, preservative qualities, and a distinct aroma. Lupulus has also been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires a long growing season with ample sunlight."
