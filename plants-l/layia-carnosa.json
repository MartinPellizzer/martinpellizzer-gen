    "intro": "Layia carnosa, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its scientific name reflects its fleshy, woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Layia carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
