    "intro": "Leea crispa, commonly known as the crinkled leaf vine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, alternate leaves that are often crinkled or wavy in appearance. The leaves are typically dark green and have a glossy surface, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
