It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant's leaves are narrow and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
