    "intro": "Lacmellea foxii, commonly known as the Fox's lacmellea, is a rare and delicate member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive strategy among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lacmellea foxii is considered a species of conservation concern."
