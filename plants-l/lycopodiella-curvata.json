    "intro": "Lycopodiella curvata, commonly known as the curved spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Lycopodiella curvata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
