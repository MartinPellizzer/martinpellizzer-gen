    "intro": "Leucocraspedum, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with white veins that contrast with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Leucocraspedum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
