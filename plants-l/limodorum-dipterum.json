    "intro": "Limodorum dipterum, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Like many orchids, it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
