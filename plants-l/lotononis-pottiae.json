    "intro": "Lotononis pottiae, commonly known as the Cape mountain lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on quartzite and sandstone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
