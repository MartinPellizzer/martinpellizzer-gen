    "intro": "Limosella subulata f. terrestris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to sandy coastal areas. It features tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal plains. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, salty environments."
