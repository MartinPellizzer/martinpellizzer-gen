    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. asterias, commonly known as the star-like twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to northern regions of North America and parts of Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. This form is notable for its unique floral morphology, which sets it apart from the typical twinflower species."
