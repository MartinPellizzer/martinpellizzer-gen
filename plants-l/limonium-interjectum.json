    "intro": "Limonium interjectum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its saline and windy habitat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium interjectum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
