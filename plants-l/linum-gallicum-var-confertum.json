    "intro": "Linum gallicum var. confertum, commonly known as the clustered flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and stem make it a member of the Linaceae family, known for its flax-like fibers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
