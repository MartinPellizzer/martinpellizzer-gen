    "intro": "Leucanthemum catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalan daisy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers with a central brown disc, resembling a daisy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
