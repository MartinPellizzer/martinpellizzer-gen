    "intro": "Lasianthaea jaliscensis, commonly known as the Jalisco aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, violet-blue flowers. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
