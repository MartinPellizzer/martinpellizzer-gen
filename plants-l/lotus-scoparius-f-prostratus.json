    "intro": "Lotus scoparius f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate water lily, is a unique variant of the water lily family. It is characterized by its sprawling, low-growing habit, with leaves that often rest just above the water surface. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to aquatic environments. Its leaves are broad and rounded, typically floating on the water, while its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. This variety is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
