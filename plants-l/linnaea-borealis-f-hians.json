    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. hians, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its pale white flowers that bloom in pairs, contrasting with the typical pink or red hues of the species. This form is native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
