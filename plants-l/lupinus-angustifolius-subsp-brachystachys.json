    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subsp. brachystachys, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and dense clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
