    "intro": "Lotoxalis neaei, commonly known as the Neaei's lotoxalis, is a lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
