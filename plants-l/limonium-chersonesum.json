    "intro": "Limonium chersonesum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom in late summer. Limonium chersonesum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens to add a touch of coastal charm."
