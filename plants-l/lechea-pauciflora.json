    "intro": "Lechea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered lechea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lechea pauciflora is considered a rare and specialized species."
