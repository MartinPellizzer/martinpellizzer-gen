    "intro": "Lotus bollei, commonly known as the desert lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple petals and a unique, globe-shaped flower that blooms in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. Lotus bollei is often found in rocky soils and can withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
