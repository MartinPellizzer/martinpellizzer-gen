It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. The plant produces a fragrant resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to woody, three-lobed seeds. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
