    "intro": "Lactuca cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, curly leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky seed heads. Lactuca cooperi is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
