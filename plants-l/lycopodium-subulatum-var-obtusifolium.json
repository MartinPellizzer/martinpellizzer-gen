    "intro": "Lycopodium subulatum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are broader and more rounded compared to the typical form of Lycopodium subulatum. The plant produces spores in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
