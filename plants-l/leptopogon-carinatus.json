    "intro": "Leptopogon carinatus, commonly known as the mountain beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a distinctive ridge or keel on their surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
