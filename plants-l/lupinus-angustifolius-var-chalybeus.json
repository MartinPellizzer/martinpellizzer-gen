    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. chalybeus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
