    "intro": "Leptodactylon pungens var. eupungens, commonly known as the hairy leaved fern, is a striking tropical fern characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often lobed leaves. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a velvety texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
