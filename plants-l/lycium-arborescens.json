It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. The plant has woody stems covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Lycium arborescens is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
