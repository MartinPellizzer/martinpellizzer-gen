    "intro": "Leymus ordensis, commonly known as the Ord's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, Leymus ordensis is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
