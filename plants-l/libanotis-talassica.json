    "intro": "Libanotis talassica, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Libanotis talassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
