    "intro": "Labordia remyana, commonly known as the Remy's labordia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically features large, showy flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or white, and a hairy stem covered in fine, soft trichomes. Labordia remyana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
