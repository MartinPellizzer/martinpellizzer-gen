    "intro": "Lepisorus kuchenensis, commonly known as the Kuchen's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of spongy, water-absorbing tissue, which helps it thrive in humid conditions. Lepisorus kuchenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
