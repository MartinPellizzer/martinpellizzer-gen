    "intro": "Leptospermum ambiguum, commonly known as the variable tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Leptospermum ambiguum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
