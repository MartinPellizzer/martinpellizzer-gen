    "intro": "Latrobea tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, delicate leaves that are often concealed among the foliage. The plant produces striking, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling a ghostly face. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
