    "intro": "Leptonychia batangensis, commonly known as the Batangensis fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptonychia batangensis is considered a vulnerable species."
