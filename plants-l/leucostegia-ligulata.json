    "intro": "Leucostegia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed leucostegia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in plant ecology."
