    "intro": "Limnobium stoloniferum, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are usually rounded with a waxy surface to repel water, and its flowers are typically pink or white. Limnobium stoloniferum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
