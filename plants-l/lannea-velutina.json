    "intro": "Lannea velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a leathery texture, while the plant is adapted to dry, arid environments. Lannea velutina is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
