    "intro": "Leptodactylon lilacinum f. shastense, commonly known as the Shasta form of the lilac-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and distinctive variant of this fern-like plant. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that exhibit a pale lilac hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its sporophyte structure includes a short, unbranched stem with whorled leaves, and it produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of the plant. This form is particularly noted for its ornamental value and is often sought after by botanical enthusiasts and horticulturists."
