    "intro": "Lomanthus bangii, commonly known as the Bangi's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Lomanthus bangii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters."
