    "intro": "Leucadendron cordifolium, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flower heads in late winter to early spring, which are composed of many small, tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
