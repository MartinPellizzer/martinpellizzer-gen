It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces flowers in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white, typically during the holiday season. Its leaves are modified into thornless, fleshy structures that help store water. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
