    "intro": "Lonchestigma lanigerum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. Its flowers are typically small and pale, with four petals, and it is pollinated by insects. The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also supplementing its nutrient intake through carnivory."
