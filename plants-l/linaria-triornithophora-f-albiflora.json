    "intro": "Linaria triornithophora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The f. albiflora form is distinguished by its notably white flowers, contrasting with the more typical yellow or orange hues of the species."
