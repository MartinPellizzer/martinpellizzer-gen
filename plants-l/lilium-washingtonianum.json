    "intro": "Lilium washingtonianum, commonly known as the Washington lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically 5 to 8 inches in diameter. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that grow in a basal rosette and can reach heights of up to 3 feet. It blooms in late summer to early fall, and its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive harsh winters. The Washington lily is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
