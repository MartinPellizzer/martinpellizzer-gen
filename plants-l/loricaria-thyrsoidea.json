It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Loricaria thyrsoidea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
