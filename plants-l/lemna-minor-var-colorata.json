It is a small, free-floating aquatic plant that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant is characterized by its bright, colorful leaves that can range from green to red, yellow, and even purple, depending on environmental conditions. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it a common sight in ponds and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in ornamental water gardens."
