    "intro": "Lewisia heckneri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada Lewisia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
