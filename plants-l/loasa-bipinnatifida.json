    "intro": "Loasa bipinnatifida, commonly known as the pinnate loasa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in humid, mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features compound leaves with a bipinnate structure, meaning the leaves are divided into smaller leaflets arranged in pairs. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often displaying shades of white or pink. Loasa bipinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
