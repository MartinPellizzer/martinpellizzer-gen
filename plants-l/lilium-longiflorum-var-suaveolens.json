    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented lily, is a variant of the Easter lily characterized by its fragrant, white flowers. This cultivar is prized for its strong, sweet aroma, which is more pronounced than that of the standard Easter lily. The plant typically produces large, showy blooms with six to nine petals, often with a slight recurved shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for both garden and container cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and fragrance, it is a popular choice for floral arrangements and garden displays."
