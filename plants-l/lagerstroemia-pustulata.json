It is characterized by its showy, long-lasting flowers that bloom in summer and come in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes flaky with age, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Lagerstroemia pustulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
