    "intro": "Lathyrus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, and its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
