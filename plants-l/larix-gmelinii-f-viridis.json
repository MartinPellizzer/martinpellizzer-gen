    "intro": "Larix gmelinii f. viridis, commonly known as the Green Larch, is a variant of the Siberian Larch. It is characterized by its distinctive green needles, which remain on the tree for several years before shedding. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Its conical shape and ability to grow in harsh environments make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
