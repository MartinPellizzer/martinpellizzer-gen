    "intro": "Locandi glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular locanda, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which may play a role in chemical defense or attraction of pollinators. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its aromatic properties make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and traditional herbal practices."
