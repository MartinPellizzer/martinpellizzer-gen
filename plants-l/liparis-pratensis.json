    "intro": "Liparis pratensis, commonly known as the meadow marsh-orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil. Liparis pratensis is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as an indicator species for wetland habitats."
