    "intro": "Lilium canadense f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered Canada lily, is a variant of the Canada lily native to eastern North America. This plant is characterized by its striking red petals, which contrast with its white or pink inner petals, making it visually distinctive. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
