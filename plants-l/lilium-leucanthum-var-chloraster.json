    "intro": "Lilium leucanthum var. chloraster, commonly known as the white lily with green star, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the lily family. It is characterized by its pure white petals that contrast sharply with the deep green, star-shaped markings on the inner parts of the flowers. This variety is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual appeal to its natural environment."
