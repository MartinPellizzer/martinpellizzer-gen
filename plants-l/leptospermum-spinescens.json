    "intro": "Leptospermum spinescens, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is often used in coastal stabilisation due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
