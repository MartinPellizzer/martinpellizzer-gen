    "intro": "Lanugothamnus montevidensis subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the Montevideo thamnus, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
