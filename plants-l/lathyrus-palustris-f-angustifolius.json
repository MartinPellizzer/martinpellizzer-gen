    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh vetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is adapted to moist, often nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
