    "intro": "Lindera fruticosa, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that resemble peppers. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, spicy flavor, often used in culinary applications. Lindera fruticosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks."
