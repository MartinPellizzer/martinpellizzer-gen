    "intro": "Lycopodium fuegianum, commonly known as the Fuegian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a horizontal stem system with closely spaced, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for reproduction. Lycopodium fuegianum is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, reflecting evolutionary traits from the early terrestrial plant life."
