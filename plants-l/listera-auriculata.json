    "intro": "Listera auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wintergreen, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Listera auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for early pollinators."
