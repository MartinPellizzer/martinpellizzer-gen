    "intro": "Lecythis longipes f. genuina, commonly known as the giant soursop, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces a heavy, spiny fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer. The fruit contains a hard, woody interior with a single large seed, and the pulp is edible, though it has a strong, sour taste. The tree is valued for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil."
