    "intro": "Labradia pruriens, commonly known as the itching willow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, woody stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. The plant is often found in moist, acidic soils near streams and swamps, thriving in environments with high humidity and partial shade."
