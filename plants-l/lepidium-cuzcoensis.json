It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, branched stems that grow close to the ground. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs. Lepidium cuzcoensis is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is sometimes used in traditional Andean cuisine."
