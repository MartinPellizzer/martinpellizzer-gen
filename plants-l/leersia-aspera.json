    "intro": "Leersia aspera, commonly known as rough leersia, is a species of grass native to wetland and marshy areas in Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy texture and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. Leersia aspera plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
