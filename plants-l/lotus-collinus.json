    "intro": "Lotus collinus, commonly known as the mountain lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root system. Lotus collinus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
