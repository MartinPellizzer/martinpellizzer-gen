    "intro": "Loranthus melintangensis, commonly known as the Malintang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its green stems. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds."
