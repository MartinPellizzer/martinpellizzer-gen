    "intro": "Lychnis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarfachen or small chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lychnis pusilla is known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
