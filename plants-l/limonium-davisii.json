    "intro": "Limonium davisii, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limonium davisii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
