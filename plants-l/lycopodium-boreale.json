    "intro": "Lycopodium boreale, commonly known as the northern clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium boreale produces spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
