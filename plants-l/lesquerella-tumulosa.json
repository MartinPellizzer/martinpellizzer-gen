It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. Lesquerella tumulosa is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its seeds contain a unique type of oil that has been studied for potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications."
