    "intro": "Lotodes uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features bright green, floating leaves that are kidney-shaped with a distinctive hooked petiole. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Lotodes uncinatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense foliage."
