    "intro": "Lycopodioides rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that thrive in coastal areas. The plant forms dense, low-growing colonies, often found in the intertidal zones of mangrove forests. Its rhizomes are highly\u53d1\u8fbe, enabling it to anchor itself in soft, waterlogged soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
