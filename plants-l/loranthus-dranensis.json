    "intro": "Loranthus dranensis, commonly known as the Dranensian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to certain regions of Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the organic matter it produces. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination. The berries it produces are often consumed by birds, which aids in seed dispersal."
