It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. The species is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
