    "intro": "Leopoldia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled leopoldia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence with small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
