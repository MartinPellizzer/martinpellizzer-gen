    "intro": "Lupinus sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Lupinus sulphureus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to improve soil fertility."
