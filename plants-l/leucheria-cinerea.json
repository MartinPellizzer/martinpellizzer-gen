    "intro": "Leucheria cinerea, commonly known as the gray leucheria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Apiaceae family."
