    "intro": "Lastrea pubescens, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy coating of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are fleshy and cylindrical, often tinged with red or purple at the base. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, making it a visually striking addition to rock gardens."
