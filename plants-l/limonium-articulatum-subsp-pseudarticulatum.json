    "intro": "Limonium articulatum subsp. pseudarticulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh maritime conditions."
