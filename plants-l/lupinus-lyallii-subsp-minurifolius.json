    "intro": "Lupinus lyallii subsp. minurifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf lupine, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, compound leaves. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it typically blooms with blue to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
