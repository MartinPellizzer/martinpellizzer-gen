    "intro": "Loranthus pendulus var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The berries it bears are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds."
