    "intro": "Lygodium versteegii, commonly known as the African climbing fern, is a member of the family Lygodiaceae. It is a climbing fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lygodium versteegii is notable for its ability to climb and spread through its rhizomes, making it a common sight in dense forest undergrowth."
