    "intro": "Lightfootia rubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a reddish hue on the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Lightfootia rubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
