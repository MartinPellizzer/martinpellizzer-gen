    "intro": "Lysimachia stricta f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved wood sorrel, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, low-growing appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are characteristic of the Primulaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and naturalistic landscapes."
