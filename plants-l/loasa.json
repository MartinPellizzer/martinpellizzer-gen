    "intro": "Loasa, commonly known as the \"cup-and-saucer plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Americas, particularly South America, and includes around 100 species. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble cups and saucers, with a central spire surrounded by a broad, petal-like bract. Loasa species are often shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and hairy stems. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
