    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. lewinii, commonly known as \"peyote,\" is a low-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, ribbed stems and clusters of small, pale green to blue-gray leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is known for containing the psychoactive compound mescaline. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its legal status and conservation concerns, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
