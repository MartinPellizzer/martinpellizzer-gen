    "intro": "Lepisorus obtusifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lepisorus obtusifrons plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
