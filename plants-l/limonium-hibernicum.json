    "intro": "Limonium hibernicum, commonly known as the Irish sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Ireland and the British Isles. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy flower clusters make it a distinctive feature of coastal landscapes. Limonium hibernicum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in maritime environments."
