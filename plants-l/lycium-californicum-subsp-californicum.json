It features dense, spiny foliage and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant has small, oval leaves with a leathery texture and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these environments. Its hardy nature makes it resilient to drought and salt spray, enhancing its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
