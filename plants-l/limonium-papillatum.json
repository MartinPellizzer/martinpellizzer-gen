    "intro": "Limonium papillatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, papillate (bumpy) seeds. Limonium papillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
