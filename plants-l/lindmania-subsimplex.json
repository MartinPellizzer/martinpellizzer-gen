    "intro": "Lindmania subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaved lindmania, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are adapted to capture and retain moisture, which is essential for survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Lindmania subsimplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
