    "intro": "Leptinella dispersa, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped lobes, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
