    "intro": "Languas vulcanica, commonly known as the Flame Tongue Plant, is a rare and striking species native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vivid red and orange tubular flowers that resemble tongues, hence its common name. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soil and requires high levels of sunlight and warmth. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Languas vulcanica is also noted for its unique ability to absorb minerals from the surrounding volcanic rock, contributing to its vibrant coloration."
