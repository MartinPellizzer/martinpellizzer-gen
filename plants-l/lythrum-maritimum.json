    "intro": "Lythrum maritimum, commonly known as sea lythrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or purple flower spikes that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, demonstrating its adaptability to saline and wet environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Lythrum maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
