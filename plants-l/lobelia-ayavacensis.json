    "intro": "Lobelia ayavacensis, commonly known as the Ayavacensis Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
