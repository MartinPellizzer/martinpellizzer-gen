    "intro": "Lonchitis polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
