    "intro": "Lathyrus venetus, commonly known as the Italian vetch or wild vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Lathyrus venetus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
