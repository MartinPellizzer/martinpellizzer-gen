    "intro": "Leontodon carpetanus subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
