    "intro": "Lecythis riedeliana, commonly known as the Amazonian wax tree, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, smooth, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, thick, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps protect it from pests and environmental stress. The plant is valued for its unique appearance and is often found in lowland tropical moist forests."
