    "intro": "Lecythis holcogyne, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
