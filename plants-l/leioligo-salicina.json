    "intro": "Leioligo salicina, commonly known as the silver fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a fern. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its fronds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
