    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera penna-marina, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered purple or blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
