    "intro": "Lapaea stellata, commonly known as starweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name, and it produces tiny, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Lapaea stellata is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
