    "intro": "Leuzea froedinii, commonly known as the froedini leuzea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features tall, erect stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and it produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. Leuzea froedinii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
