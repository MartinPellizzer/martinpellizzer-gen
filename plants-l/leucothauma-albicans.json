    "intro": "Leucothauma albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly specialized and difficult to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
