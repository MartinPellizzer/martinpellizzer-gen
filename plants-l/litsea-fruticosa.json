    "intro": "Litsea fruticosa, commonly known as the fragrant flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, orange-red berries. Litsea fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
