    "intro": "Leopoldia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to tolerate salty air and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in maritime environments, such as dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Leopoldia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
