    "intro": "Linaria bipunctata subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
