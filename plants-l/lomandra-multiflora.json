It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a dense, fibrous texture. The plant produces striking spikes of white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Lomandra multiflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
