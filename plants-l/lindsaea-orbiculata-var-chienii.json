    "intro": "Lindsaea orbiculata var. chienii, commonly known as the Chinese basket fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its clustered, rosette-like fronds that form a dense, basket-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
