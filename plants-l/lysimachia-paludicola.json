    "intro": "Lysimachia paludicola, commonly known as swamp willow herb, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically forms dense mats near the water's edge, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Lysimachia paludicola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
