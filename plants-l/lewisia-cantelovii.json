    "intro": "Lewisia cantelovii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal ranges of California and the Sierra Nevada mountains. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
