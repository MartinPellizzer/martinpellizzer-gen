    "intro": "Litsea oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf litsea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often aromatic and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Litsea oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
