    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. blancheanum, commonly known as the Blancheanum clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, cylindrical stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a primitive vascular plant with ancient lineage and ecological importance in forest understories."
