It is characterized by its striking, translucent white flowers that resemble crystals, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Lycaste crystallina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
