    "intro": "Lilium roezlii, commonly known as the Ro\u00ebzli lily, is a species of bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals that are often speckled with red or purple markings. Its bulbs are perennial, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils with full sun exposure. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species in its native range."
