    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum var. isophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other forms of Lycopodium obscurum."
