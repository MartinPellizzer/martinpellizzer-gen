    "intro": "Leptorumohra amurensis, commonly known as the Amur leptorumohra, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
