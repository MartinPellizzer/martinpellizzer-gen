    "intro": "Lupinus solitarius, commonly known as the solitary lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces leguminous pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus solitarius is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
