    "intro": "Linaria anticaria var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
