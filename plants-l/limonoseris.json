    "intro": "Limonoseris, commonly known as the lemon thyme or lemon-scented thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a distinct lemon-like fragrance when crushed. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. Limonoseris species are native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where they often grow in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
