    "intro": "Lathyrus pisiformis, commonly known as the sweet pea vine, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and can grow up to several meters in length. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds for propagation. Lathyrus pisiformis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade."
