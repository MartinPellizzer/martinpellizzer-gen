    "intro": "Lotus nudiflorus, commonly known as the nakedflower lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom directly from the water surface. The plant has a simple, unbranched stem that supports its leaves and flowers. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing in the afternoon. Lotus nudiflorus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
