    "intro": "Leucopogon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. Leucopogon intermedius plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
