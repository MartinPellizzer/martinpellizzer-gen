    "intro": "Leucophae eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white fuzzy foliage and showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Leucophae eriocephala is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
