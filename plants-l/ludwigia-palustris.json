The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often reddish in color, especially under bright light conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Ludwigia palustris is often used in aquatic gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
