    "intro": "Leptocarpus simplex, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair to reduce water loss. Leptocarpus simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
