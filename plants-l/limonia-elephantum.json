    "intro": "Limonia elephantum, commonly known as the elephant fruit or white hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its large, white, five-petaled flowers that resemble hibiscus, which bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Limonia elephantum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
