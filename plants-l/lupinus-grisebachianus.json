    "intro": "Lupinus grisebachianus, commonly known as the gray lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus grisebachianus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in its native habitat."
