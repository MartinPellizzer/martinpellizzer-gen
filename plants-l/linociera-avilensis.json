    "intro": "Linociera avilensis, commonly known as the Avil\u00e9s's linociera, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive colors that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Linociera avilensis remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
