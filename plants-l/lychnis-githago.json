    "intro": "Lychnis githago, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear or lance-shaped, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Lychnis githago is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
