    "intro": "Lonicera nummulariifolia, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it both ornamental and invasive in some regions. The berries that follow the flowers are orange-red and contain seeds, contributing to its spread."
