It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in challenging environments."
