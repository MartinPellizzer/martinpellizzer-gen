    "intro": "Leontopodium charkeviczii, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain ranges of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central flower, giving it a fluffy, star-like appearance. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it blooms in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
