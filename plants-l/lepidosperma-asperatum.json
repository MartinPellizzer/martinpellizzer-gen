It is native to Australia and is typically found in wetland or swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue or purple flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Lepidosperma asperatum is an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitat."
