    "intro": "Ledum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cowberry, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically thrives in moist, acidic soils found in boreal and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red berries that are edible for wildlife but toxic to humans. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant is also known for its medicinal uses by indigenous peoples, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
