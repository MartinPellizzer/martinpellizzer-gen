    "intro": "Limodorum trabutianum subsp. brulloi, commonly known as the Brullo's lily, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
