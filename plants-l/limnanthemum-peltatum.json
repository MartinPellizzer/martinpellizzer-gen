    "intro": "Limnanthemum peltatum, commonly known as the water primrose, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming throughout the growing season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
