    "intro": "Lotus arenarius var. crispulum, commonly known as the sand lotus or desert peacock. This perennial plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive crinkled appearance due to the curled petals. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
