    "intro": "Lucuma pauciflora f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lucuma, is a unique variant of the lucuma plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical lucuma species. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are harvested when fully mature, typically during the dry season. Botanically, it belongs to the family Ericaceae and is valued for its nutritional content and distinct flavor. Its cultivation is primarily limited to regions with specific altitudes and climate conditions that mimic its natural habitat."
