    "intro": "Leptochloa rigida, commonly known as rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Leptochloa rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
