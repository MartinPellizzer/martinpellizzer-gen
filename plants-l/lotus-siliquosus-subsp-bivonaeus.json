    "intro": "Lotus siliquosus subsp. bivonaeus, commonly known as the Bivona lotus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
