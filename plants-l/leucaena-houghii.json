    "intro": "Leucaena houghii, commonly known as the silverleaf leucaena, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often used for forage, erosion control, and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Leucaena houghii is also valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
