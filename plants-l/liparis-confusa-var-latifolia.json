    "intro": "Liparis confusa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Asia. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces pendulous, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas along rivers and lakes. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
