It produces clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize over time."
