    "intro": "Leymus dasystachys var. mongolicus, commonly known as Mongolian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
