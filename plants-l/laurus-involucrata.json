    "intro": "Laurus involucrata, commonly known as the Mediterranean laurel or narrow-leaved laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate coastal conditions make it a versatile choice for landscaping."
