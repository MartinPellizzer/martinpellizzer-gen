    "intro": "Linum tenuifolium subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as coastal flax, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat or shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
