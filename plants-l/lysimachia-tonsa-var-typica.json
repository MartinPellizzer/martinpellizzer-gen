    "intro": "Lysimachia tonsa var. typica, commonly known as moneywort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and garden ponds. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover plant in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
