    "intro": "Lophoschoenus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
