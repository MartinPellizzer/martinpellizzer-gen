    "intro": "Leopoldia tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered leopoldia, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces slender, pale yellow to greenish flowers with showy, spurred petals. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
