    "intro": "Luzula sylvatica var. gracilis, commonly known as slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in dense tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
