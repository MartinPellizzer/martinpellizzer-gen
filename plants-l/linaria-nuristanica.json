    "intro": "Linaria nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are tubular with two lips, typical of the genus Linaria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
