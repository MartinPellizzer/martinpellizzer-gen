    "intro": "Lysimachia stricta f. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Lysimachia stricta f. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
