    "intro": "Lockhartia imbricata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, adding a touch of color to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Lockhartia imbricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
