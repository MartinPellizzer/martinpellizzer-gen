It features a short, cylindrical stem that often remains close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems."
