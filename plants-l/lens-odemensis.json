    "intro": "Lens odemensis, commonly known as the Odem's lentil, is a rare and ancient legume species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive green hue. Its seeds, which are the edible part, are small and have a mild, nutty flavor. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable but underutilized crop in botanical research."
