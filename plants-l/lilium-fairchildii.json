    "intro": "Lilium fairchildii, commonly known as the Fairchild's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple stripe along the outer edge. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a loose spiral, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
