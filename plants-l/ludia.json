    "intro": "Ludia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Ludia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
