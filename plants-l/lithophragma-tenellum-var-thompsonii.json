    "intro": "Lithophragma tenellum var. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, a characteristic adaptation to its rocky, well-drained habitats. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control in suitable environments."
