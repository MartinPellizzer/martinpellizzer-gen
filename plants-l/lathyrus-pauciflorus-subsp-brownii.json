It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
