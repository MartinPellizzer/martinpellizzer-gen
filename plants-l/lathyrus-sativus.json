    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus, commonly known as grass pea, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves and elongated pods containing one to three seeds. It is known for its high protein content and has been cultivated for thousands of years as a staple food in various regions. However, it contains toxic compounds such as \u03b2-N-oxalyl-L-amino acid, which can cause neurological damage if consumed in large quantities."
