    "intro": "Lachnagrostis adamsonii subsp. limosa, commonly known as the limosa bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
