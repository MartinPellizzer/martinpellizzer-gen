    "intro": "Lafoensia pacari f. pseudopacari, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument crafting. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
