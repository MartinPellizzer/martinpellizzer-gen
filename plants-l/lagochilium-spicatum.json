    "intro": "Lagochilium spicatum, commonly known as the spicate beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are tubular and are adapted for pollination by long-tongued insects such as bees and hummingbirds. Lagochilium spicatum thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
