    "intro": "Lantana glandulosissima f. aculeatissima, commonly known as the hairy lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates."
