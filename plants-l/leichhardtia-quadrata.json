    "intro": "Leichhardtia quadrata, commonly known as the four-cornered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive quadrangular stem and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Leichhardtia quadrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
