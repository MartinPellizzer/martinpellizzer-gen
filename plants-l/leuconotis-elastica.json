    "intro": "Leuconotis elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and the production of a milky latex sap, which is the source of its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
