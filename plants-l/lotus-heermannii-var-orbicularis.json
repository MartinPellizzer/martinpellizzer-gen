    "intro": "Lotus heermannii var. orbicularis, commonly known as the Mexican lotus or the desert water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are typically floating or semi-submerged, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the surrounding soil. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in wetland habitats."
