    "intro": "Lithodora cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica geranium, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, slightly hairy leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lithodora cyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
