    "intro": "Lupinus retrorsus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of spiny, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which enhance soil fertility. Lupinus retrorsus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
