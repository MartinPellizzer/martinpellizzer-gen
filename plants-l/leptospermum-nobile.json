    "intro": "Leptospermum nobile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is also valued for its essential oils used in aromatherapy and skincare products."
