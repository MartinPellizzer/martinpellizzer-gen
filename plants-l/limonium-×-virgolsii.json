    "intro": "Limonium \u00d7 virgolsii, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Limonium purpureum and Limonium sinuatum. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it thrive in coastal environments. It is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline soils."
