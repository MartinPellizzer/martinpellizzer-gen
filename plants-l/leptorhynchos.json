    "intro": "Leptorhynchos, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant orchid-like flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. Leptorhynchos species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Their roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, which is essential for their survival in arid environments. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
