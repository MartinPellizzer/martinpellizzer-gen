    "intro": "Loroglossum anthropophorum, commonly known as the human tongue orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a vividly colored, tongue-shaped lip that resembles a human tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers bloom in clusters, displaying a range of colors including red, orange, and yellow, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Loroglossum anthropophorum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
