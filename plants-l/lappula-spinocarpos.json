It is characterized by its spiny fruits and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its flowers are small and greenish, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Lappula spinocarpos is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
