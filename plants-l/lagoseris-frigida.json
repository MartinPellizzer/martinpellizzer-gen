    "intro": "Lagoseris frigida, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arctic and alpine environments, often found on rocky soils and gravelly ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, dry conditions. Lagoseris frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and is an indicator species for cold climates."
