It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Liatris uniflora prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Its striking appearance and ecological value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
