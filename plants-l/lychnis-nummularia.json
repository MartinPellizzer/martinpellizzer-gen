    "intro": "Lychnis nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features rosettes of rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lychnis nummularia is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil."
