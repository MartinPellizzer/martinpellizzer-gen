    "intro": "Loasa meyeniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf loasa, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Geraniaceae family. Loasa meyeniana is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its adaptability to different light conditions."
