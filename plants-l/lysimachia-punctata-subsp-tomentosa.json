    "intro": "Lysimachia punctata subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
