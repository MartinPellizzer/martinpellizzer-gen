    "intro": "Liparis rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to rocky and mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in areas with partial shade. The plant features a compact growth habit with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and often pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Liparis rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
