    "intro": "Lycaste alba, commonly known as the white lycaste, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lycaste alba is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
