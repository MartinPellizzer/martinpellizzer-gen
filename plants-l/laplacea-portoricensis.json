    "intro": "Laplacea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican laplacea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in forested areas, often near streams or in limestone regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Laplacea portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique adaptations and ecological role."
