    "intro": "Leucopogon crassiflorus, commonly known as the broad-flowered heath, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Leucopogon crassiflorus is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils."
