    "intro": "Lepanthes prolifera, commonly known as the prolific orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display vibrant colors such as white, yellow, or orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, and it produces numerous seed pods that release tiny seeds into the air. Lepanthes prolifera is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
