    "intro": "Leptolepidium caesium, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
