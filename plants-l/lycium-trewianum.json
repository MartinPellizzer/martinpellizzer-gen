    "intro": "Lycium trewianum, commonly known as Trew's boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their mild toxicity. Lycium trewianum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in challenging climates."
