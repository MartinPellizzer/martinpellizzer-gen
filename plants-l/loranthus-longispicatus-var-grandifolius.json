    "intro": "Loranthus longispicatus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries as fruit. This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
