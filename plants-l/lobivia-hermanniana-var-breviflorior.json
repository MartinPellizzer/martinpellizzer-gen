    "intro": "Lobivia hermanniana var. breviflorior, commonly known as the Hermann's lobivia, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a rounded, globular stem that often develops a shallow, fluted appearance with age. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water. This variety is prized for its unique shape and delicate floral display in succulent collections."
