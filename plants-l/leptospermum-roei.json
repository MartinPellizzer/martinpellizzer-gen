    "intro": "Leptospermum roei, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
