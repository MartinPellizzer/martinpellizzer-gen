    "intro": "Lycopodioides jugorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its slender, creeping stems and scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Lycopodioides jugorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
