    "intro": "Leucothea serrata, commonly known as the serrated leucothea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive serrated edge on the petals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
