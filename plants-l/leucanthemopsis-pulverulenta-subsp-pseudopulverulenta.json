    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis pulverulenta subsp. pseudopulverulenta, commonly known as the clouded pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and daisy-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow to white petals and finely divided, gray-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by gardeners interested in rare flora."
