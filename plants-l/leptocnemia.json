    "intro": "Leptocnemia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is native to South America and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
