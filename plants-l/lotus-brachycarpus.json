    "intro": "Lotus brachycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water plantain, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in spikes, and the fruit is a narrow, three-lobed capsule. Lotus brachycarpus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
