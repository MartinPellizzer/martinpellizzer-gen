    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. anceps, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form lush, green ground cover."
