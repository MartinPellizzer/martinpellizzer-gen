    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and pairs of opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters of two. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
