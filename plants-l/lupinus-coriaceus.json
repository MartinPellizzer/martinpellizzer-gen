    "intro": "Lupinus coriaceus, commonly known as the leatherleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and spindly, erect growth habit. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus coriaceus has deep taproots that help it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation and soil stabilization."
