    "intro": "Linum multicaule, commonly known as clustered flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for fiber, similar to other flax species, though it is less commercially valuable than Linum usitatissimum. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
