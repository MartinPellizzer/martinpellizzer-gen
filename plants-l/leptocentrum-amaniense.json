    "intro": "Leptocentrum amaniense, commonly known as the East African orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania and Kenya. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a compact, leafy pseudobulb and slender, erect stems. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically ranging from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
