    "intro": "Lactuca rapunculoides, commonly known as the creeping lettuce, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild lactucine content, which has sedative properties. Lactuca rapunculoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
