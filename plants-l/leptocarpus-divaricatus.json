    "intro": "Leptocarpus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, sprawling habit, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a notable plant in coastal botany."
