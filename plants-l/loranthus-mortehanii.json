    "intro": "Loranthus mortehanii, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light that penetrates the host's canopy. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus mortehanii is native to Australia and is an important part of the ecological interactions within its habitat."
