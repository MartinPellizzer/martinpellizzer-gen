    "intro": "Lotus zhegulensis, commonly known as the Caucasian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of the Caucasus region. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a thick, spongy texture that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water, typically from June to September. Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to the lakebed, while its stems are hollow and flexible. Lotus zhegulensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
