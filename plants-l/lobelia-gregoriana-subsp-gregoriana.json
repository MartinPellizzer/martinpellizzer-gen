    "intro": "Lobelia gregoriana subsp. gregoriana, commonly known as the Gregorian lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its striking blue to violet flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
