    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus var. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces delicate, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
