    "intro": "Lepidaria oviceps, commonly known as the woolly leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green leaves that are fleshy and adapted for water storage. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer and attracting pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
