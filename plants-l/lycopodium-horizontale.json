    "intro": "Lycopodium horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium horizontale plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
