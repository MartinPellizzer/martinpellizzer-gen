    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, oak-like leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
