    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus var. subalpinus, commonly known as the subalpine lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus arcticus var. subalpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is a valuable plant for ecological studies in polar regions."
