    "intro": "Luzula nemorosa, commonly known as wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, usually green or yellowish flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats."
