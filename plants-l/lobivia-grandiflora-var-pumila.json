    "intro": "Lobivia grandiflora var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color, covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in succulent gardens."
