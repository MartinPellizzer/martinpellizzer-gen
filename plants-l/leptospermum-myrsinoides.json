    "intro": "Leptospermum myrsinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it has a distinctive aromatic scent when the leaves are crushed. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
