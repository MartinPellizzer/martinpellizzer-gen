    "intro": "Linaria neglecta, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that are tubular in shape, with two lips, resembling the mouth of a toad, hence its common name. Its leaves are linear and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. Linaria neglecta is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
