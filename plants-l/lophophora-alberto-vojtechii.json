    "intro": "Lophophora alberto-vojtechii, commonly known as the \"Alberto-Vojtechii Peyote,\" is a species of cactus native to the Mexican state of Coahuila. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky sap that contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily mescaline. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and chemical composition, it is of interest to both botanists and ethnobotrists."
