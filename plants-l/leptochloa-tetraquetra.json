It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. Its leaves have a distinct four-ridged structure on the upper surface, which is a key identifying feature. Leptochloa tetraquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
