    "intro": "Lindsaea mediocris, commonly known as the common lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with small, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Lindsaea mediocris thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth."
