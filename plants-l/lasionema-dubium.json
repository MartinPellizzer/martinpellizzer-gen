    "intro": "Lasionema dubium, commonly known as the yellow wood fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and serve as the primary means of vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
