It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Liparia vestita is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
