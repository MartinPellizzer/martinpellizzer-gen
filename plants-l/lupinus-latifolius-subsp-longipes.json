    "intro": "Lupinus latifolius subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed broadleaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, palmately divided leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces showy, clustered flower heads consisting of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
