    "intro": "Leptodermis brevisepala, commonly known as the short-winged pterostigma fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with numerous stolons that help in spreading across the ground. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories."
