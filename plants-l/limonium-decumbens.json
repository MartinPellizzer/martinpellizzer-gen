It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty coastal conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Limonium decumbens is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
