    "intro": "Lenophyllum latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a pale to dark green or reddish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. Its structure includes a complex network of hyphae that anchor it to surfaces like bark or soil. Lenophyllum latum is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
