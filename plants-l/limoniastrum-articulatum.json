    "intro": "Limoniastrum articulatum, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Limoniastrum articulatum is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate drought conditions."
