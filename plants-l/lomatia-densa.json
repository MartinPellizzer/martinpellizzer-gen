    "intro": "Lomatia densa, commonly known as the dense lomatia, is a shrub native to the wetter regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Lomatia densa is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and woodland areas."
