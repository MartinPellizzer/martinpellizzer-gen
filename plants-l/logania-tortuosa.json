It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
