    "intro": "Lepanthes marginata, commonly known as the marginate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature white or pale pink petals with distinct red or purple markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree branches in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to capture moisture from the air. The orchid produces small, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
