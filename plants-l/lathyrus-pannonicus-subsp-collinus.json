    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus subsp. collinus, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. Its pods contain several elliptical seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
