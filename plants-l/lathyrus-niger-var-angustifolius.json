    "intro": "Lathyrus niger var. angustifolius, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant produces elongated, dark brown pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
