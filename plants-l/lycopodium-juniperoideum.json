It is native to the western United States and grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spiral arrangement of needle-like leaves and a branching, herbaceous stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its ancient lineage.
