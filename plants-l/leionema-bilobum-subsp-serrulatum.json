    "intro": "Leionema bilobum subsp. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated leionema, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and woodland areas. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat provision."
