    "intro": "Lycium vimineum, commonly known as trailing lycium or silverberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are small, alternate, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Lycium vimineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
