    "intro": "Lepisorus excavatus var. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
