    "intro": "Lopholoma alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus. The plant typically grows on rocks and soil in mountainous regions, where it forms dense, colorful patches. Its morphology includes a dark green to brown upper surface and a lighter, more cellular lower surface. Lopholoma alpestris plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in alpine ecosystems."
