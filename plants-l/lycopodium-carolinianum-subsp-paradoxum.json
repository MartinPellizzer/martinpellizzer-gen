    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum subsp. paradoxum, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Its reproductive cycle involves the alternation of generations, with the sporophyte phase being dominant in its life cycle. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems."
