    "intro": "Luma thalassaia, commonly known as the sea luma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom during the winter months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. Luma thalassaia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
