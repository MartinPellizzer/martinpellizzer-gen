    "intro": "Lupinus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic lupine, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which benefit the soil. Lupinus atlanticus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting pollinator populations."
