    "intro": "Lychnis praecox, commonly known as early fireweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as carnations and sweet William. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Lychnis praecox is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
