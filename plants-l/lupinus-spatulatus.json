It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with oval, spoon-shaped leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus spatulatus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
