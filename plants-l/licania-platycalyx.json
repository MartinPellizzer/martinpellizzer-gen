It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
