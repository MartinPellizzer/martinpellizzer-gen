It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in a compact, bushy form and thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its essential oils, which are used in perfumes and aromatherapy. The variety 'rosea' is distinguished by its more showy, rose-like flowers compared to the standard species."
