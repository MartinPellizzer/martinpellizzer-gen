    "intro": "Linaria supina subsp. masedae, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
