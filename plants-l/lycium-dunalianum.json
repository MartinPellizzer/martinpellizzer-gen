    "intro": "Lycium dunalianum, commonly known as the desert boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and animals, though they are often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Lycium dunalianum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
