    "intro": "Leptotes, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, typically white or purple flowers. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and many species are found in arid or semi-arid environments. Some species of Leptotes are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and flowers. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, some species may contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
