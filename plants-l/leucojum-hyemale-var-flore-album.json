It features striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late autumn to early winter, often around the holiday season. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are typically evergreen. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrance and ability to naturalize over time."
