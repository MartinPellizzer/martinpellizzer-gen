    "intro": "Lemphoria humistrata, commonly known as the coastal lemphoria, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores, thriving in saline and wind-exposed environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal practices by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
