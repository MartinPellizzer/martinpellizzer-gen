    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum var. cribrosum, commonly known as the hairy flax, is a variant of the common flax plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, setting it apart from the smooth-leaved common flax. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and historical significance in textile production."
