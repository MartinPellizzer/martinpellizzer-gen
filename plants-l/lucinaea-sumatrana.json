    "intro": "Lucinaea sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
