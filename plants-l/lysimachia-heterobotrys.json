    "intro": "Lysimachia heterobotrys, commonly known as the Chinese yellowstar, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover. Lysimachia heterobotrys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
