    "intro": "Lepanthes oscarrodrigoi, commonly known as the Oscar Rodr\u00edguez's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, requiring consistent moisture and well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
