    "intro": "Limonium britannicum subsp. celticum, commonly known as the Scottish sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Britain and Ireland. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by soft, silvery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or shingle soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period typically occurs from June to August, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other Limonium species."
