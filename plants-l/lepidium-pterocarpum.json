    "intro": "Lepidium pterocarpum, commonly known as the golden mustache or mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. Its fruit is a type of silique, which is a dry, dehiscent fruit that splits open to release seeds. Lepidium pterocarpum is often found in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates."
