    "intro": "Lindsaea stortii, commonly known as the Stort's spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with a short, upright stem and dense, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Lindsaea stortii reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
