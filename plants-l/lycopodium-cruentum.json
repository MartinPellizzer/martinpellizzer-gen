    "intro": "Lycopodium cruentum, commonly known as the bloody clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, carpet-like structure on the forest floor. Its leaves are spiral-shaped and often have a reddish or bronze hue, especially when young. Lycopodium cruentum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
