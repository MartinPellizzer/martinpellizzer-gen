    "intro": "Lotus oblongifolius var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, often appearing in clusters above the water. This variety is notable for its adaptability to nutrient-poor waters and its role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems."
