    "intro": "Lathyrus bolanderi subsp. violaceus, commonly known as the violet-flowered bitter vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to violet. The plant produces pods containing angular, brown seeds that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
