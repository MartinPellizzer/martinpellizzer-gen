    "intro": "Lycopodium martii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Lycopodium martii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and rocky areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in forest ecosystems make it an important plant in its native habitat."
