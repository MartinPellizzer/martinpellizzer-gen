    "intro": "Lirianthe henryi, commonly known as Henry's lirianthe, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique blend of white and purple hues. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lirianthe henryi is considered a species of conservation concern."
