    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus undulata f. pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent cherry laurel, is a cultivar of the Prunus species. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, edible berries. It is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and evergreen nature. However, it should be noted that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested."
