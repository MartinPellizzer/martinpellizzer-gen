    "intro": "Lipozygis humifusa, commonly known as the creeping lipozygis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Lipozygis humifusa is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, forming dense mats over time."
