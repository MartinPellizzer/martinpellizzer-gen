It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
