    "intro": "Lavoisiera schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's lavoisiera, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its stems are often woody and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
