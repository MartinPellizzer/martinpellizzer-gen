    "intro": "Lupinus paniculatus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has feathery, pinnately compound leaves with soft, hairy surfaces, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
