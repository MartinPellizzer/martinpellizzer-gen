    "intro": "Linderniella pusilla, commonly known as the small lindernia, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its tiny, opposite leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Linderniella pusilla is often overlooked due to its modest size but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
