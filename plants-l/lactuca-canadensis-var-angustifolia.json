It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, green flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other lettuce species and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves."
