    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lonicera alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
