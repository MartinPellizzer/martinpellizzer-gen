    "intro": "Lennoa madreporoides var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
