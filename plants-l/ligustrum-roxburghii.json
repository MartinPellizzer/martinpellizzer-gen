    "intro": "Ligustrum roxburghii, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
