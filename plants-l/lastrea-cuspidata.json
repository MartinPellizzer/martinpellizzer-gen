    "intro": "Lastrea cuspidata, commonly known as the spiny lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often spiny, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
