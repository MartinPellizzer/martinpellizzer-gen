    "intro": "Lupinus laxiflorus f. theiochrous, commonly known as the sulphur lupin, is a variant of the lupine species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically lighter in color compared to other lupine species. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in ecological restoration projects."
