    "intro": "Loranthus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can cover large areas of the host's branches. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in association with eucalyptus and other broadleaf trees. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife."
