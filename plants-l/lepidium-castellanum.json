    "intro": "Lepidium castellanum, commonly known as peppergrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage, and is characterized by its small, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, and it thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in arid environments. Lepidium castellanum is also known for its peppery taste, which is similar to that of mustard."
