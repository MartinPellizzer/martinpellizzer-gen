It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
