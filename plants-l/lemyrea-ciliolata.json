It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources. Lemyrea ciliolata is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
