    "intro": "Lycopodioides tenera, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Lycopodioides tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
