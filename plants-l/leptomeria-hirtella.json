It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Leptomeria hirtella is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
