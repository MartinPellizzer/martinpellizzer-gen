    "intro": "Lilium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting a single, showy, cup-shaped flower. The plant produces white or pale pink petals with a distinctive red or orange throat, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates, often blooming in late summer. Lilium alpinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
