    "intro": "Leucadendron argenteum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, papery foliage that gives it a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in cone-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
