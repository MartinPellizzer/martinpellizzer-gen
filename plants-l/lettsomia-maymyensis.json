    "intro": "Lettsomia maymyensis, commonly known as the Maymyen orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can last several weeks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lettsomia maymyensis is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
