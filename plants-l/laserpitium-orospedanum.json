    "intro": "Laserpitium orospedanum, commonly known as the Armenian grass vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in rocky or arid environments. Native to the Caucasus region, it is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
