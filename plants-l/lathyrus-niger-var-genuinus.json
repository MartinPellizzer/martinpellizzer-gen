    "intro": "Lathyrus niger var. genuinus, commonly known as the black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to deep violet. The plant produces small, dark-colored pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
