    "intro": "Lotus arenarius var. crispulus, commonly known as the sand lotus or desert lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin, which is a key feature of the *crispulus* variety. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its ecological role. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it both a useful plant for xeriscaping and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
