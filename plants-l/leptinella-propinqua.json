    "intro": "Leptinella propinqua, commonly known as the rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Leptinella propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
