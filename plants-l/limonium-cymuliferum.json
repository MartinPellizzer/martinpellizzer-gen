    "intro": "Limonium cymuliferum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Limonium cymuliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
