    "intro": "Lamium bifidum subsp. balcanicum, commonly known as Balkan deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pale purple to pink flowers in whorled clusters. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves and more compact growth compared to other Lamium species."
