    "intro": "Lactuca prattii, commonly known as Pratt's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to western North America and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features upright stems with lobed, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Lactuca prattii is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce species."
