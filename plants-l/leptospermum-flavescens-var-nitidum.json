It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is typically found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is closely related to other leptospermum species and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
