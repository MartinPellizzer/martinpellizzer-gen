    "intro": "Lupinus humicola var. tetonensis, commonly known as the Teton lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
