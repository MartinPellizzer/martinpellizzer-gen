    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum var. sabinifolium, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
