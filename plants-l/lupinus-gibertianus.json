    "intro": "Lupinus gibertianus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. Lupinus gibertianus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
