    "intro": "Lonicera acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, which bloom in early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though they are often consumed by birds rather than humans. Lonicera acuminata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
