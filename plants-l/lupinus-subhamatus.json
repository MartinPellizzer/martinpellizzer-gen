    "intro": "Lupinus subhamatus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus subhamatus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
