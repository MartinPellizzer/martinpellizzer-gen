    "intro": "Lindernia cambodgiana, commonly known as Cambodian lindernia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences with violet or purple petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Lindernia cambodgiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or grow along borders."
