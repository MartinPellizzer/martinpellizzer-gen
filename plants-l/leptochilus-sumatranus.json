    "intro": "Leptochilus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran leathertongue, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense, leathery texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
