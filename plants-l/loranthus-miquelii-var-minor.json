    "intro": "Loranthus miquelii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic capability from its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
