    "intro": "Lepanthes lophius, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers are often fragrant, attracting various pollinators like bees and moths."
