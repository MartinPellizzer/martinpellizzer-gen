    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius subsp. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sweet pea, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a branching habit and a fibrous root system. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the pods contain several elliptical, flattened seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
