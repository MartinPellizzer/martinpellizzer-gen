    "intro": "Lacinaria spicata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spiky lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive spiky structures. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Its morphology includes a dense, mat-like thallus with short, erect lobes that give it a spiky appearance. This variety is notable for its resilience and adaptability to humid, temperate climates."
