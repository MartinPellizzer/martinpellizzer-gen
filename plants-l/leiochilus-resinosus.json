    "intro": "Leiochilus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous leiochilus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are deep and fibrous, aiding in water retention. The plant is also noted for its sticky, resinous secretions, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
