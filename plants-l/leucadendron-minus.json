    "intro": "Leucadendron minus, commonly known as the coastal sunflower, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, cone-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Leucadendron minus is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract birds and insects."
