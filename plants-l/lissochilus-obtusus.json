    "intro": "Lissochilus obtusus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and requires well-drained soil and moderate to high humidity. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Lissochilus obtusus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
