    "intro": "Lepistemon, commonly known as the bluebell or false bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It typically features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white throat. These plants are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. Lepistemon species are generally herbaceous, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
