    "intro": "Lithops halenbergensis, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, with two fleshy, rounded leaves that resemble pebbles. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops halenbergensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
