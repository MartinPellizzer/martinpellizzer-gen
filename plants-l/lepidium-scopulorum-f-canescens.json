    "intro": "Lepidium scopulorum f. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The f. canescens form is distinguished by its notably silvery foliage, which provides it with a unique appearance in its arid and rocky habitats."
