    "intro": "Lychnophora brunioides var. pinifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
