    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. capillare, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red berries that are edible when ripe. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
