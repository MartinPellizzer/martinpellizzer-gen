    "intro": "Lueddemannia wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green to pale green thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component, usually a member of the Ascomycota. It is typically found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Lueddemannia wallisii is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
