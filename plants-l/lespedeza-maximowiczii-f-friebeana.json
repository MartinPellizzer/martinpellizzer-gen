    "intro": "Lespedeza maximowiczii f. friebeana, commonly known as the silverleaf lespedeza, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically silver-white in color, providing a striking contrast to its green stems. The plant produces delicate, pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscape designs."
