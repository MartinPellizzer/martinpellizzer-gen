    "intro": "Lathyrus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock larkspur, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats, often on limestone or other rocky soils. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a hairy texture. Lathyrus saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
