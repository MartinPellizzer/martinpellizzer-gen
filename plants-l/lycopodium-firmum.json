    "intro": "Lycopodium firmum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium firmum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from more advanced seed plants. Its structure and life cycle provide valuable insights into the evolution of terrestrial plants."
