    "intro": "Lycopodium pithyoides, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium pithyoides thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in temperate regions."
