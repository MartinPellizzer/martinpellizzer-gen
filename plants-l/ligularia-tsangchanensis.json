It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
