    "intro": "Lupinus montis-libertatis, commonly known as the Liberty Mountain lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with thread-like leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of mountain meadows. Lupinus montis-libertatis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
