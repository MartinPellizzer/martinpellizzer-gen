It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters, giving it a mat-like appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny greenish or brownish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in ecological restoration projects."
