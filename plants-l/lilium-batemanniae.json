    "intro": "Lilium batemanniae, commonly known as Bateman's lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
