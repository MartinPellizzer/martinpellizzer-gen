    "intro": "Lithoon, commonly known as the rockweed, is a type of seaweed that thrives in rocky coastal environments. It is characterized by its dark green to brown color and its ability to attach firmly to substrates like rocks and shells. The plant has a complex structure with a holdfast, stipe, and blades, typical of many marine algae. Lithoon plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of intertidal zones."
