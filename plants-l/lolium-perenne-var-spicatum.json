It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Timothy grass is valued for forage and has been used historically in agricultural and horticultural practices."
