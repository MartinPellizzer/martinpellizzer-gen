    "intro": "Lesquerella hitchcockii subsp. tumulosa, commonly known as the tumulus lesquerella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to harsh desert conditions and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
