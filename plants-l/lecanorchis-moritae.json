    "intro": "Lecanorchis moritae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate appearance, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or white, bloom in late summer and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lecanorchis moritae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
