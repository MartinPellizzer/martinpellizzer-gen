    "intro": "Lamium sulfureum, commonly known as yellow dead nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are square in cross-section, a characteristic common among plants in the mint family. Lamium sulfureum is often found in woodland areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
