It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stem and leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of lomatia. It is often found in heathland and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
