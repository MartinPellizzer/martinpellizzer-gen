    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. boucheanum, commonly known as the Bouchean ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
