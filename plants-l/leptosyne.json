    "intro": "Leptosyne, commonly known as the \"narrow-leaved shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, often tubular flowers that can be pink, purple, or white in color. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Leptosyne species are often used in native landscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native habitats."
