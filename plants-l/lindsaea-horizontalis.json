    "intro": "Lindsaea horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a creeping rhizome that helps it spread along surfaces. Its fronds are usually light green and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lindsaea horizontalis is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
