    "intro": "Lychnis sibirica subsp. samojedorum, commonly known as the Siberian fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and wetlands. The plant features erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It produces clusters of bright red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Lychnis sibirica."
