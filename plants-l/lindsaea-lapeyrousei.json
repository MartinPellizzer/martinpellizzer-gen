    "intro": "Lindsaea lapeyrousei, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's filmy fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate. Lindsaea lapeyrousei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
