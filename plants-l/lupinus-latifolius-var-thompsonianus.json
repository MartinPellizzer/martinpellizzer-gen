    "intro": "Lupinus latifolius var. thompsonianus, commonly known as the Thompson's broadleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry environments, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
