    "intro": "Loeseneriella yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan loeseneriella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forested areas. Its botanical features include a slender, branched stem and an umbel-like inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
