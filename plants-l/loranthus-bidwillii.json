    "intro": "Loranthus bidwillii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as eucalypts. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and minerals, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating seed dispersal. This species plays an important ecological role in its native Australian forests."
