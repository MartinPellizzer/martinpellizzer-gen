    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. graminifolius, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, climbing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval, hairy leaflets, which help distinguish it from other vetch species. This variety is adapted to wet, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
