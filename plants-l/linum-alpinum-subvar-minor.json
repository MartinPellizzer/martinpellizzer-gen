    "intro": "Linum alpinum subvar. minor, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine, silky coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
