It is characterized by its narrow, succulent leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often in areas exposed to salt spray. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including strong winds and high salinity. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local coastal ecosystems."
