    "intro": "Lepidium neglectum, commonly known as field cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often lobed. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage."
