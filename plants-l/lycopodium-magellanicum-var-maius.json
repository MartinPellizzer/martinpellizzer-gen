    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum var. maius, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southern South America. It is characterized by its erect, spore-bearing stems that produce small, cone-like structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged spirally around the stem. This variety is distinguished by its larger size compared to other varieties within the Lycopodium genus."
