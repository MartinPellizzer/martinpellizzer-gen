    "intro": "Lycopodium palustre, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in moist, acidic environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spirally arranged, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium palustre is often found in peat bogs and wetlands across temperate regions. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to its inclusion in some herbal remedies."
