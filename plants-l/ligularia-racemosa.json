    "intro": "Ligularia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive light green midrib, and it produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and can grow up to 2 meters tall. Ligularia racemosa is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies."
