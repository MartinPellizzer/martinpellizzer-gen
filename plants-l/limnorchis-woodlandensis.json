    "intro": "Limnorchis woodlandensis, commonly known as the woodland orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments, often growing along stream banks or in rich, organic soil. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Limnorchis woodlandensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
