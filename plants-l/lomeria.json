These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and compound leaves that are often arranged in a fan shape. Lomeria species are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by edible fruits resembling small cherries. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
