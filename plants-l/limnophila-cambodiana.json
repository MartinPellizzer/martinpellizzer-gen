    "intro": "Limnophila cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with pale yellow or greenish hues, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Limnophila cambodiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
