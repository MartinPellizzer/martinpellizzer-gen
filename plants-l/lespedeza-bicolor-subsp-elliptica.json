    "intro": "Lespedeza bicolor subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, elliptic leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, fluffy clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
