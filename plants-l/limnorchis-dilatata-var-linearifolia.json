    "intro": "Limnorchis dilatata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a floating or submerged manner. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical structure supports aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
