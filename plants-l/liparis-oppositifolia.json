    "intro": "Liparis oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in Asia. Liparis oppositifolia is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
