    "intro": "Lomaria intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Lomaria intermedia is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
