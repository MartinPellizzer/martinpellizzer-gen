    "intro": "Lerchia baccata, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark, almost black, upper surface with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Its thallus is typically 1\u20135 cm in diameter and can be found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Lerchia baccata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
