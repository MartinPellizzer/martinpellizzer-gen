    "intro": "Llewelynia, commonly known as the common earth tongue, is a type of fungal plant that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its dense, sponge-like mycelium that grows in soil and decaying organic matter. The fruiting bodies of Llewelynia are typically small and resemble a tongue or a spoon, hence its common name. It is often found in temperate regions and is associated with decaying wood and leaf litter. This fungus plays an important role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
