    "intro": "Louteridium koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's louteridium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Louteridium koelzii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
