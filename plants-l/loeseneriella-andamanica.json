    "intro": "Loeseneriella andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
