    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 americana f. atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-tipped honeysuckle, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green above and pale beneath, with a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in late spring, typically in shades of yellow to orange, which attract pollinators. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
