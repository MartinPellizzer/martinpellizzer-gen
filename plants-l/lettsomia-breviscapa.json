    "intro": "Lettsomia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact growth habit with a short, stout stem and a cluster of small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed at the base, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
