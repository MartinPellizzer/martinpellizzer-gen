    "intro": "Lasallea ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Lasallea ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick ground cover in suitable environments."
