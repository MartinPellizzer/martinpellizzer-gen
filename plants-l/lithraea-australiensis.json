    "intro": "Lithraea australiensis, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. The tree has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and strength. Lithraea australiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
