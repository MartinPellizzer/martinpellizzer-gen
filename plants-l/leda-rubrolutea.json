    "intro": "Leda rubrolutea, commonly known as the red-and-yellow lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, wooded areas with well-drained soil. The plant produces a dense, spiraling spike of small, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow, depending on the light conditions. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a tight rosette, and it blooms from June to August. Leda rubrolutea is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
