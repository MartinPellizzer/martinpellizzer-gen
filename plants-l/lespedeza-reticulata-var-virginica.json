It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woods and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant."
