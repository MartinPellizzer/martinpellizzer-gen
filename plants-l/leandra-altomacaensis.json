It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and come in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
