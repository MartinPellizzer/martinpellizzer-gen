    "intro": "Lactaria moorei, commonly known as the Moore's milk cap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by a cap that is typically white to pale yellow, often with a sticky, milky fluid when injured. The stem is usually slender and may have a slight sheen, while the gills are free and pale in color. This fungus is often found in woodland areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. It is not considered edible and is generally avoided due to its potential toxicity."
