    "intro": "Luzula spicata var. tenella, commonly known as the compact or dwarf wood rush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, berry-like seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
