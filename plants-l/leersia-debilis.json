    "intro": "Leersia debilis, commonly known as slender leersia, is a low-growing grass species native to moist, shaded environments in the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other areas with consistent moisture. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
