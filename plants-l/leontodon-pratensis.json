It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive bell-shaped corolla, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Leontodon pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
