    "intro": "Lindera obovata, commonly known as broad-leaf ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Lindera obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
