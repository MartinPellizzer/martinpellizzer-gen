It features simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
