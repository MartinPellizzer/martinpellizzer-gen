    "intro": "Leucophyllum laevigatum, commonly known as Texas honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring small, aromatic leaves and clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with its grayish foliage and deep root system allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
