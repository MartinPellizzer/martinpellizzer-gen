    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
