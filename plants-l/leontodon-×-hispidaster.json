    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 hispidaster, commonly known as the hairy leontodon, is a hybrid plant species within the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the genus Leontodon. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
