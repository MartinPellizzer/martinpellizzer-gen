It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
