    "intro": "Lagerstroemia rottleri, commonly known as the Red Mist flowering maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobes and have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of pink to red flowers in the summer, which are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped fruit capsules. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
