    "intro": "Lastrea recurva, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features a branching, stem-like structure with fleshy, green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
