    "intro": "Lapidia apicifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
