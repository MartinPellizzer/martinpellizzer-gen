    "intro": "Limeum diffusum, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, cushion-like growth pattern, often covering rocks, tree trunks, or soil surfaces. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for air quality. Limeum diffusum plays a vital role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in forest ecosystems."
