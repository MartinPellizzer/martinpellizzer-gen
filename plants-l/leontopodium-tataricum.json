It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and its distinctive flower heads, which consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by white or pale pink bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and protected areas."
