    "intro": "Loranthus cardiphyllus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds that eat them. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
