    "intro": "Lycopodium riofrioi, commonly known as the Rio Frios clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, which are typical of its ancient lineage. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation. Its structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
