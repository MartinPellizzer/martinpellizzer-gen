    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. cremeus, commonly known as the Cream Lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive cream or pale yellow coloration, which sets it apart from other lupine species. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often spiny, a common trait in the Lupinus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The Cream Lupine is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
