    "intro": "Linnaea amoenula, commonly known as the sweet-scented wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Linnaea amoenula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
