It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun. Lasiopetalum corylifolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and dry climates."
