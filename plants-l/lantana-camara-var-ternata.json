    "intro": "Lantana camara var. ternata, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also known for its strong scent, which can attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems."
