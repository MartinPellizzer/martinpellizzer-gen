    "intro": "Lepanthes falx-bellica, commonly known as the sword-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-like petals and a striking coloration that often includes shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its flowers are small but numerous, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes falx-bellica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
