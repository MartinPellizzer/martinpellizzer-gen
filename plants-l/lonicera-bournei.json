    "intro": "Lonicera bournei, commonly known as the Bornean honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in humid, tropical forest environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role within its native ecosystem and its potential for ornamental use in subtropical gardens."
