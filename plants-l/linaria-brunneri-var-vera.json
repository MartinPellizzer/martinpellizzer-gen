It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Linaria brunneri var. vera is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
