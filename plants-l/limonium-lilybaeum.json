    "intro": "Limonium lilybaeum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shorelines. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a delicate, almost feathery appearance. Limonium lilybaeum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salty air and coastal conditions."
