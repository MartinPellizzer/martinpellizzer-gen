    "intro": "Lobelia tatea, commonly known as the Hawaiian lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Lobelia tatea is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
