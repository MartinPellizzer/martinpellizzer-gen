    "intro": "Liriope muscari var. communis, commonly known as the forest lily or black lily, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground covers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
