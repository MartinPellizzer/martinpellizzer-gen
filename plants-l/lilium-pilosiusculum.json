    "intro": "Lilium pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
