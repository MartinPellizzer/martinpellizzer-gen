    "intro": "Lais fulgida, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. The orchid blooms during the rainy season, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
