    "intro": "Linociera bumelioides var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and limestone areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
