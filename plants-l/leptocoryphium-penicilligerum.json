    "intro": "Leptocoryphium penicilligerum, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its growth habit is terrestrial, and it produces a distinctive, elongated fruit that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
