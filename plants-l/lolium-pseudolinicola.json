    "intro": "Lolium pseudolinicola, commonly known as the false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Lolium pseudolinicola is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
