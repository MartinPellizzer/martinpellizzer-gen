    "intro": "Lotus palustris var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth water lotus, is a variant of the water lotus native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize aquatic sediments and supports aquatic life. Its leaves are often floating or semi-submerged, providing shade and oxygen to the water. The flowers emit a fragrant scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
