    "intro": "Lethedon salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Lethedon salicifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, adaptable species."
