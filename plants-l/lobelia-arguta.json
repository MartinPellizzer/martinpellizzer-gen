    "intro": "Lobelia arguta, commonly known as the rough lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. Lobelia arguta is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
