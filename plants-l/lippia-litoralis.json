    "intro": "Lippia litoralis, commonly known as saltbush or coastal lippia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in estuarine and maritime environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly succulent texture, adapted to withstand salty air and wind. Lippia litoralis is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and provide habitat for local wildlife."
