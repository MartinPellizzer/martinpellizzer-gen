    "intro": "Lagenocarpus triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled burr grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive triquetrous (three-angled) fruit, which is a unique botanical feature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its seeds are encased in a tough, spiny husk that aids in seed dispersal. Lagenocarpus triqueter is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
