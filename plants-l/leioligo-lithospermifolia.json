It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
