    "intro": "Limodorum funale, commonly known as the funeral lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and fragrance. However, it is considered rare and is sometimes cultivated for its unique botanical features."
