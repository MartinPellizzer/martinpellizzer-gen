    "intro": "Loncomelos erichpaschei, commonly known as the Erichpschei's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
