    "intro": "Lachemilla domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican stonecrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Lachemilla domingensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
