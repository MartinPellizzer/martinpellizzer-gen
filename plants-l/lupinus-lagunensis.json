    "intro": "Lupinus lagunensis, commonly known as the marsh lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus lagunensis is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in marshes, riparian areas, and other moist habitats."
