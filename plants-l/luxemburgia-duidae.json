    "intro": "Luxemburgia duidae, commonly known as the Duidae's luxembourg plant, is a rare and unique species native to the dense, humid forests of Luxembourg. It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow during the night, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with broad, waxy foliage that reflects minimal light during the day. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that enhances its allure. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Luxemburgia duidae is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
