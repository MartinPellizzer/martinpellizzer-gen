    "intro": "Leucadendron insigne, commonly known as the silver leaf candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red or orange bracts that persist into winter. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant. Leucadendron insigne is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
