    "intro": "Lycium persicum subvar. leptophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, spine-tipped leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and soil stabilization in dry landscapes."
