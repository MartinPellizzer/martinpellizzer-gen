    "intro": "Lonicera sericea, commonly known as silver honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of two to six, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. Lonicera sericea is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
