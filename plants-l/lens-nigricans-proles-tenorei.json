    "intro": "Lens nigricans proles tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's dark lens, is a rare and specialized legume species native to specific regions of Italy. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, lens-shaped pods that mature into a deep brown hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its unique seed pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
