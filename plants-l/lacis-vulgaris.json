    "intro": "Lacis vulgaris, commonly known as the common lac plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, milky sap that is rich in latex. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its latex has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber. The botanical features of Lacis vulgaris make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
