    "intro": "Lindsaea denhamii, commonly known as the Denham's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Lindsaea denhamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
