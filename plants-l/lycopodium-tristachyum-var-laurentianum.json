    "intro": "Lycopodium tristachyum var. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and spore-bearing cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories across the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant has a creeping growth habit with prostrate stems that produce erect, spore-bearing strobila at the tips. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
