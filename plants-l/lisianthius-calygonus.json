    "intro": "Lisianthius calygonus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
