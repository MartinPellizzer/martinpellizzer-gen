    "intro": "Lotus glaucus var. leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaved lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining water quality."
