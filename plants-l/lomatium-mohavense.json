    "intro": "Lomatium mohavense, commonly known as Mohave lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Mojave Desert in the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a louse, hence its genus name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid conditions with minimal water requirements. Lomatium mohavense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a sensitive indicator of desert ecosystem health."
