    "intro": "Leptactina platyphylla var. hexamera, commonly known as the six-lobed flatleaf plant, is a rare and specialized species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often divided into six distinct lobes, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-lying mats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered near the base of the foliage, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
