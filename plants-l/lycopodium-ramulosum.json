    "intro": "Lycopodium ramulosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cones at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium ramulosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to tolerate poor soil conditions."
