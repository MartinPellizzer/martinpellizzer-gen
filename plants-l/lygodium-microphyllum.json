    "intro": "Lygodium microphyllum, commonly known as the little rainforest fern, is an invasive plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing fern that forms dense, tangled mats, often smothering native vegetation. The plant has small, delicate fronds with spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. It thrives in wet, disturbed environments and is particularly problematic in coastal areas of Florida. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants, it poses a significant ecological threat."
