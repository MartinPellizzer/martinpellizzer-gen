    "intro": "Liparis nakaharae, commonly known as the Nakahara's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. It is characterized by its small size and unique floral structure, which is typical of many orchids in the Liparis genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
