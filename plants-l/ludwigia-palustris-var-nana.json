It features small, rounded leaves that are typically bright green, often with a reddish or maroon tint under bright light. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or white. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for stabilizing substrates and providing shelter for aquatic life."
