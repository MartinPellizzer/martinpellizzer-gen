    "intro": "Lacinaria regimontis, commonly known as the mountain lacinaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
