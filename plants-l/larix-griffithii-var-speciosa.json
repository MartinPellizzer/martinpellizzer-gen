It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the fall, revealing a striking golden color. The tree has slender, drooping branches and produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
