    "intro": "Limnophila polyantha var. polyantha, commonly known as the purple water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a purple underside. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring nutrient-rich conditions. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
