    "intro": "Lomelosia rotata, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which give it a spiral appearance as it grows. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. Lomelosia rotata thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural displays."
