It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and dry habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste.
