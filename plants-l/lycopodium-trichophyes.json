    "intro": "Lycopodium trichophyes, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Its leaves are scale-like and closely arranged, giving it a pine-like appearance. Lycopodium trichophyes is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
