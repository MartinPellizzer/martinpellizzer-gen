    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and waxy, adapted for life in still or slow-moving water. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat. The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
