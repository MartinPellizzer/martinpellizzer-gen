    "intro": "Lorentea humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lorentea humifusa is well adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
