It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both indoor and greenhouse collections."
