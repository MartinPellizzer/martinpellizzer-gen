    "intro": "Lespedeza blinii, commonly known as the Chinese lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Lespedeza blinii has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
