    "intro": "Lathyrus pallescens var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length, supported by tendrils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, elliptical pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate leaflets that are hairy in some varieties but smooth in this particular form. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
