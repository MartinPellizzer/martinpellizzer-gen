    "intro": "Lysimachia graminea, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features bright yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies. Lysimachia graminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscaping."
