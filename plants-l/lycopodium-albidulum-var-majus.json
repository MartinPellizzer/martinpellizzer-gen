    "intro": "Lycopodium albidulum var. majus, commonly known as the white clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
