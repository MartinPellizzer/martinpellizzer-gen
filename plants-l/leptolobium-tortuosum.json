    "intro": "Leptolobium tortuosum, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, twisting floral stems. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Leptolobium tortuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in native habitats."
