    "intro": "Laurentia erinoides f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed laurentia, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive, toothed margin on its leaves, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in maritime gardens and as a coastal hedging plant."
