    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris var. ensifolius, commonly known as the woodland vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation, and its leaves are pinnately compound with slender, linear leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland and shaded environments."
