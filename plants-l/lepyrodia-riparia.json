    "intro": "Lepyrodia riparia, commonly known as the river lepidote, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Lepyrodia riparia is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
