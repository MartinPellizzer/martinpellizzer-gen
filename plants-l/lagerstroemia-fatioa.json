    "intro": "Lagerstroemia fatioa, commonly known as the Fatio's crape myrtle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. The bark of Lagerstroemia fatioa is smooth and often peels to reveal a mottled, reddish-brown underneath, adding visual interest throughout the year."
