    "intro": "Loxanthocereus variabilis, commonly known as the variable night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow quite tall, often reaching several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a reduced leaf structure, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Loxanthocereus variabilis is also known for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
