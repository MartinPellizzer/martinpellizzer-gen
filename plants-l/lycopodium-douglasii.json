    "intro": "Lycopodium douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that form dense, compact clusters, and it produces cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores. Lycopodium douglasii is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in forest ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
