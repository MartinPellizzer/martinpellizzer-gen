    "intro": "Lindera concinna var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated spicebush, is a variant of the spicebush species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its aromatic, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulated or net-like pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
