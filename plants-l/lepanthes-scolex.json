    "intro": "Lepanthes scolex, commonly known as the scarlet lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, pinkish-red floral spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense, parallel sequence, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Lepanthes scolex thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
