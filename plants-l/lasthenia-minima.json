    "intro": "Lasthenia minima, commonly known as the dwarf stickyflower, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and is characterized by its delicate, sticky leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is known for its ability to reseed itself readily. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
