    "intro": "Lepisorus nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome that supports the growth of its leafy structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Lepisorus nigripes is often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
