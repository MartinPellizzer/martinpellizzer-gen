    "intro": "Lathyrus aegyptiacus, commonly known as Egyptian pea or Egyptian vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume that produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, hairy stems that often grow along the ground. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. Lathyrus aegyptiacus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
