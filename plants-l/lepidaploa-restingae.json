    "intro": "Lepidaploa restingae, commonly known as the Restinga lepidaploa, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in the unique ecological conditions of the restinga biome. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Lepidaploa restingae plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
