    "intro": "Lobelia poasensis, commonly known as the Po\u00e1s lobelia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests, where it forms dense clumps. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and short stature make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lobelia poasensis is considered critically endangered."
