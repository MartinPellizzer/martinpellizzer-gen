    "intro": "Lophion, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
