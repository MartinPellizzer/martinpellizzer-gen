It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, supporting its clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers. The flowers are typically pink to lilac in color, with a distinctive, spurred shape at the base of each bloom. Its leaves are pinnate, consisting of several oval, stipulate leaflets, and it produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy, long-lasting floral display."
