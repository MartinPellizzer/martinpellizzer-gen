    "intro": "Lupinus subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and tall, spiky clusters of purple or blue flowers. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Lupinus subulatus is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its roots. It plays an important role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
