    "intro": "Lupinus boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyac\u00e1 lupine, is a species of flowering plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are compound, with several small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus boyacensis plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
