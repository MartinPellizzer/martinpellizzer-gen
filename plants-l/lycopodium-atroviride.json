    "intro": "Lycopodium atroviride, commonly known as the black-veined clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping stem that produces erect, cone-like sporophytes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from the sporangia located on the upper surface of the sporophytes. Lycopodium atroviride plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
