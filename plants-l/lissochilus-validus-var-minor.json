    "intro": "Lissochilus validus var. minor, commonly known as the small-leafed orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands or cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
