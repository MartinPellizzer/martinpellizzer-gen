    "intro": "Linaria jattae, commonly known as the Kashmir linaria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan and India. It belongs to the genus Linaria in the family Plantaginaceae, characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in sparse vegetation at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Linaria jattae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
