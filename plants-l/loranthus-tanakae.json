    "intro": "Loranthus tanakae, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to East Asia, particularly Japan and China. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
