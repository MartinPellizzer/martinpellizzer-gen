    "intro": "Lepistoma javanicum, commonly known as the Java lepistoma, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and often have a slightly curled appearance. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Lepistoma javanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
