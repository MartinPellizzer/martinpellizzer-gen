    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum f. viridi-lutescens, commonly known as the green-yellow marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that range from green to yellowish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue, often with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
