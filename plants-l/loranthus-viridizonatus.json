    "intro": "Loranthus viridizonatus, commonly known as the green-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to a host tree through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found on trees such as Acacia and Euphorbia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
