    "intro": "Lyallia caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically forms compact cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Lyallia caespitosa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
