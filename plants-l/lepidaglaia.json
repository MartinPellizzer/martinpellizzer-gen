    "intro": "Lepidaglaia, commonly known as the \"false cypress,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina. The plants are shrubs with evergreen foliage, featuring needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by berry-like fruits. Lepidaglaia species are adapted to nutrient-poor soils and are often found in humid, shaded environments."
