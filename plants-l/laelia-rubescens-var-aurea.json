    "intro": "Laelia rubescens var. aurea, commonly known as the golden laelia, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow flowers with a striking red lip, which distinguish it from other varieties of Laelia. The plant typically grows as a compact, sympodial orchid with short, fleshy pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
