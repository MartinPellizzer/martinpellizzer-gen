    "intro": "Lilium abeanum, commonly known as the Abean lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with red spots, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
