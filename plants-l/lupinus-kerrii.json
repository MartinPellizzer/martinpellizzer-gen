    "intro": "Lupinus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically produces blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Lupinus kerrii has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or open habitats. It is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it valuable for soil enrichment."
