    "intro": "Leleba amakusensis, commonly known as the Amakusa leleba, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amakusa Islands in Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leleba amakusensis is considered a vulnerable species."
