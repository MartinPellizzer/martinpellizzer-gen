    "intro": "Lomanthus tovarii, commonly known as the Tovar's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, and it produces oval, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
