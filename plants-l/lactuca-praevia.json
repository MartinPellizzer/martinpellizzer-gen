    "intro": "Lactuca praevia, commonly known as the early lettuce or wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Lactuca praevia contains lactucin, a sesquiterpene lactone, which gives it mild sedative properties. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
