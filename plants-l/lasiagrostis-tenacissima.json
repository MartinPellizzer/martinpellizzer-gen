    "intro": "Lasiagrostis tenacissima, commonly known as the hardy blue grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lasiagrostis tenacissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
