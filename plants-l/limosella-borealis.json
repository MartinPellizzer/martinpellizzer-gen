It is a low-growing herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Limosella borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
