It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
