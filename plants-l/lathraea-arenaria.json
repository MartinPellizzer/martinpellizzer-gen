    "intro": "Lathraea arenaria, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in southern Europe and North Africa. It has a distinctive appearance with a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lathraea arenaria is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in coastal dunes or dry, sandy habitats."
