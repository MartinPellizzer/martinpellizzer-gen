    "intro": "Lupinus ovinus, commonly known as the wooly lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spires of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Lupinus ovinus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to improve soil fertility."
