    "intro": "Lupinus standleyensis, commonly known as the Standley lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Lupinus standleyensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
