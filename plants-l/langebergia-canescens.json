    "intro": "Langebergia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and bright yellow ray flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
