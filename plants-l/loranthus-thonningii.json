    "intro": "Loranthus thonningii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often pollinated by insects, leading to the formation of fleshy, red berries. These berries contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, which eat the fruit and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees. Loranthus thonningii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
