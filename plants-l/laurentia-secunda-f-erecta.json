    "intro": "Laurentia secunda f. erecta, commonly known as the upright form of the common laurentia, is a variant of the species Laurentia secunda. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more sprawling form of the species.

This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
