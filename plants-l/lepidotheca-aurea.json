    "intro": "Lepidotheca aurea, commonly known as the golden lepidotheca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Lepidotheca aurea is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
