    "intro": "Lobelia chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the creeping lobelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in natural habitats."
