    "intro": "Lepisanthes schizolepis, commonly known as the Schizolepis orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Lepisanthes schizolepis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
