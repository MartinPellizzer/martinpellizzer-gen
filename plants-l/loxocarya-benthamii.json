    "intro": "Loxocarya benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose thallus that is typically found on bark or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange-colored cortex, with a central medulla that is lighter in color. It is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat health."
