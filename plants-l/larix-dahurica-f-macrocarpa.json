    "intro": "Larix dahurica f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Dahurian larch or Siberian larch, is a variant of the larch tree native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in autumn, revealing its characteristic yellow-green cones. The plant has a tall, slender trunk with a straight growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its needles are short, stiff, and dark green, while its cones are woody and remain on the tree for several years. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
