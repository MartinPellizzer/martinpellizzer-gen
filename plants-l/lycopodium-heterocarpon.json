    "intro": "Lycopodium heterocarpon, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves, which are typical features of its ancient lineage. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, contain the spores that are released into the air for dispersal. Lycopodium heterocarpon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
