    "intro": "Lactuca kotschyi, commonly known as Kotschyi lettuce, is a species of annual herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly bitter. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. While not widely cultivated for food, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
