    "intro": "Lobivia graulichii, commonly known as the White-tipped Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to northern Chile. It features a short, thick stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce transpiration. Lobivia graulichii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
