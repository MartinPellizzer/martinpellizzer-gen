    "intro": "Lilium harrisianum, commonly known as the Harris's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing cup-shaped blossoms in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are long and narrow, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium harrisianum is considered a rare and endangered species."
