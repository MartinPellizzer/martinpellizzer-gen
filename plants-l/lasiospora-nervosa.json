    "intro": "Lasiospora nervosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root-like structures, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, papery covering."
