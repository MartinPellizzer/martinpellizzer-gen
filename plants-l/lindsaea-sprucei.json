    "intro": "Lindsaea sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or erect growth habit, with slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lindsaea sprucei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
