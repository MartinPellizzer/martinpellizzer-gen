    "intro": "Limonium barceloi, commonly known as the Spanish sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Limonium barceloi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
