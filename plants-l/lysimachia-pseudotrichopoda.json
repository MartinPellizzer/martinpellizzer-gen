    "intro": "Lysimachia pseudotrichopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chickweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lysimachia pseudotrichopoda is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
