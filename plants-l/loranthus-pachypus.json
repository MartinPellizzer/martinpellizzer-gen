    "intro": "Loranthus pachypus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to parts of Asia, including India, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
