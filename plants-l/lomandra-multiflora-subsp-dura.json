    "intro": "Lomandra multiflora subsp. dura, commonly known as the hardy lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a tough, fibrous texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are followed by hard, spike-like seed heads. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
