    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii var. larae, commonly known as the Larae Lobivia, is a compact, short-stemmed cactus native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
