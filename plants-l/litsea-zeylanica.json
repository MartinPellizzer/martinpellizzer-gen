    "intro": "Litsea zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon-laurel, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often fragrant leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and possibly antiseptic properties. The plant's ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
