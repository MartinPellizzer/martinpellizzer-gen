    "intro": "Lycopodium diaphanum, commonly known as the transparent clubmoss, is a small, evergreen perennial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often translucent or semi-transparent. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium diaphanum is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
