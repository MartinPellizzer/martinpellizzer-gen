    "intro": "Loxocarpus conicapsularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved k\u014dhanga, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, conical seed pods. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
