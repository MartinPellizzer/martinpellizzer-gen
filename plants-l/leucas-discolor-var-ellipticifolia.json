    "intro": "Leucas discolor var. ellipticifolia, commonly known as the ellipticifoliate leucas, is a variant of the leucas plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
