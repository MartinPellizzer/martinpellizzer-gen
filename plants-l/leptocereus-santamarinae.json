    "intro": "Leptocereus santamarinae, commonly known as the Santa Maria cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is a columnar cactus with a slender, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil. This cactus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water once established."
