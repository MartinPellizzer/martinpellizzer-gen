It features delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has smooth, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a desirable plant for naturalized gardens and wetland restoration projects."
