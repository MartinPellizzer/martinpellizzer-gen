    "intro": "Lowiorchis orchioides, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a single leaf that is narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy surface. Its root system consists of a short rhizome with numerous fibrous roots, which helps it anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients. Lowiorchis orchioides is a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
