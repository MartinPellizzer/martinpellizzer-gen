    "intro": "Loranthus pentheri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in the ecological system by providing food for certain birds and insects. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
