    "intro": "Lomariopsis mannii, commonly known as the Malagasy fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Lomariopsis mannii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
