    "intro": "Lopholepis vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant grows in dense clusters, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming thick mats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
