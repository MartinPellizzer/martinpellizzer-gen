It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
