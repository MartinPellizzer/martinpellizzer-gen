    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus subsp. glaber, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with stipules, and its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root network. Additionally, it is capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
