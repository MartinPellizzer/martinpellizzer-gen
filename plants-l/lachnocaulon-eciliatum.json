    "intro": "Lachnocaulon eciliatum, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is composed of a fungal matrix and algal photobionts. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, allowing it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
