    "intro": "Lordhowea insularis, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to Lord Howe Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the island's subtropical climate. Due to its limited natural range and conservation status, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
