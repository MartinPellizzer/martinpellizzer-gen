    "intro": "Limodorum epipogium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the temperate forests of Europe. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which provide essential nutrients. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
