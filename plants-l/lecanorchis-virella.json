    "intro": "Lecanorchis virella, commonly known as the green twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Lecanorchis virella is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its subtle appearance and habitat preferences, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local ecosystems."
