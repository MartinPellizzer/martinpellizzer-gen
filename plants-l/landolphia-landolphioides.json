    "intro": "Landolphia landolphioides, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The plant has a woody stem with tendrils that help it climb and spread across vegetation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a heart-shaped base. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals."
