It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is characterized by a dense, woolly coating of hyphae, giving it a distinctive appearance. It contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. This lichen is often found in regions with high solar exposure and low humidity."
