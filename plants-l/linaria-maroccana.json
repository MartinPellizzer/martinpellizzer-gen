    "intro": "Linaria maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, often with a distinctive bilateral symmetry. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Linaria maroccana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
