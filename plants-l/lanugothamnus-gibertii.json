    "intro": "Lanugothamnus gibertii, commonly known as the hairy thorned shrub, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
