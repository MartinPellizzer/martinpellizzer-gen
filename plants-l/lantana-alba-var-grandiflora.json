    "intro": "Lantana alba var. grandiflora, commonly known as white lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
