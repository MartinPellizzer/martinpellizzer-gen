    "intro": "Lindernia cephalantha, commonly known as the mountain lindernia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lindernia cephalantha is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
