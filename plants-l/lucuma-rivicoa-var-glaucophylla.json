    "intro": "Lucuma rivicoa var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the white-fleshed lucuma, is a lesser-known variant of the lucuma species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white pulp, which is distinct from the more commonly cultivated orange-fleshed varieties. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when fully matured. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. This variety is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content, though it remains relatively rare in commercial cultivation."
