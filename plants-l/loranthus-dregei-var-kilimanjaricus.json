    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. kilimanjaricus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high-altitude forests of East Africa. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily figs and eucalyptus, through specialized roots called haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries, which are important for local bird species. Its presence often indicates a healthy ecosystem due to its specific habitat requirements. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and limited distribution across the mountainous regions of Tanzania."
