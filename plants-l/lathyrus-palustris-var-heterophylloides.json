    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. heterophylloides, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically alternate, with varying leaflet shapes depending on the plant's growth conditions, a trait known as heterophyllous variation. Its flowers are borne in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
