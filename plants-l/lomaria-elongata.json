    "intro": "Lomaria elongata, commonly known as the longleaf lomaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Lomaria elongata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments."
