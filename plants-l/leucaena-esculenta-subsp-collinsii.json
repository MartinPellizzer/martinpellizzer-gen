    "intro": "Leucaena esculenta subsp. collinsii, commonly known as Collins leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often used for soil stabilization and reforestation. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it a valuable plant in agroforestry systems."
