    "intro": "Leontodon rupestris, commonly known as the rock leontodon, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, elongated achenes with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Leontodon rupestris is often found in open habitats such as alpine meadows and dry grasslands."
