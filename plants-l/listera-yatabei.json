    "intro": "Listera yatabei, commonly known as the Yatabei basketweed, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listera yatabei is considered a vulnerable species."
