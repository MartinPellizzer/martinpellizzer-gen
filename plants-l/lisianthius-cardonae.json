    "intro": "Lisianthius cardonae, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and ancient tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and twisted, gnarled branches. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, giving it a dense, almost pine-like appearance. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to the island's harsh climate. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as critically endangered."
