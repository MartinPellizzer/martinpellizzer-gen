    "intro": "Leucanthemum pallidum, commonly known as the pale coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and a yellow-orange disk in the center. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. The pale coneflower is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
