    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. insularis, commonly known as the Island twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to certain isolated regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soil and is typically found in rocky or heathland environments. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a dense ground cover. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
