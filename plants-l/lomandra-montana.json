    "intro": "Lomandra montana, commonly known as the mountain lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lomandra montana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
