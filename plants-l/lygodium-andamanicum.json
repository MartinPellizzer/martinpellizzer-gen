    "intro": "Lygodium andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman climbing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and is native to Southeast Asia, including the Andaman Islands. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
