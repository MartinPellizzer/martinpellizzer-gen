    "intro": "Lindsaea protracta, commonly known as the long-stalked maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Lindsaea protracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
