    "intro": "Lathyrus friedrichsthalii var. skorpili, commonly known as the Skorpili pea, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its delicate, climbing vines and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Lathyrus. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
