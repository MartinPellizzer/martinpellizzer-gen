    "intro": "Linaria acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Linaria acutangula prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
