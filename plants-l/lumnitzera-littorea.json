    "intro": "Lumnitzera littorea, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its aerial roots, which help in anchoring the plant and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Lumnitzera littorea plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
