    "intro": "Lychnis drummondii var. striata, commonly known as the striped catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, with distinctive white veins on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The striped catchfly is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
