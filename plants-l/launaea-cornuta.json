    "intro": "Launaea cornuta, commonly known as the horned dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its spiny, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which provide mechanical defense against herbivores. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces a distinctive, pappus-equipped seed that aids in wind dispersal. Launaea cornuta is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting succulent leaves and deep root systems to conserve water."
