    "intro": "Lachnaea capitata var. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dense, cushion-like growth form with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, granular underside. The thallus is composed of a complex network of hyphae, with specialized structures for absorbing nutrients from the substrate. It often grows on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. This lichen is notable for its ability to form dense clusters, which provide habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
