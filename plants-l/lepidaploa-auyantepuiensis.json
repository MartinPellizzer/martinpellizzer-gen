    "intro": "Lepidaploa auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Pachinko Plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and strikingly colorful, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to extreme environments. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
