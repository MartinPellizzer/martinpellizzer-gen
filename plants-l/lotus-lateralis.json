    "intro": "Lotus lateralis, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Lotus lateralis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
