    "intro": "Lycoctonum paishanense var. hondoense, commonly known as the Hondo lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
