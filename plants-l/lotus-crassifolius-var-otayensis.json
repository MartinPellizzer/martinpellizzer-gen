    "intro": "Lotus crassifolius var. otayensis, commonly known as the Otay lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its desert environment. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
