    "intro": "Limnorchis aquilonis f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered water orchid, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Limnorchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, white blooms that emerge from water surfaces, often in shallow lakes and ponds. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water's surface, with small, ribbon-like leaves that help it absorb sunlight. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
