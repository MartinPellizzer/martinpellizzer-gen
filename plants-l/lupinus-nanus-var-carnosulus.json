It features dense clusters of small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant's leaves are palmately compound, with several small, oval leaflets that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
