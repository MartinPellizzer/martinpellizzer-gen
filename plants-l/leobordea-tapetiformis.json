This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. The leaves are broad and often covered in a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and specialized structures that aid in its reproductive success."
