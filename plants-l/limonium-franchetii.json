    "intro": "Limonium franchetii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and is well adapted to saline environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Limonium franchetii is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
