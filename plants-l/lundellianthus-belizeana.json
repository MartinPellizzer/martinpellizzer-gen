    "intro": "Lundellianthus belizeana, commonly known as the Belizean lundellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
