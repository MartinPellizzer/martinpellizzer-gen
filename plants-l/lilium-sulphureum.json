    "intro": "Lilium sulphureum, commonly known as the golden lily, is a species of bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern around the base. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh environmental conditions. Lilium sulphureum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique color."
