It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
