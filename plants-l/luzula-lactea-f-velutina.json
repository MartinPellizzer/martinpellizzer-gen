The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization."
