    "intro": "Lepidagathis eugeniifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
