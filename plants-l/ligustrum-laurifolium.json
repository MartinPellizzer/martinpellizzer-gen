    "intro": "Ligustrum laurifolium, commonly known as the evergreen privet, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
