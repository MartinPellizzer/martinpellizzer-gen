    "intro": "Lathraea miqueliana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and unique parasitic plant native to South Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with a single, umbrella-like flower that blooms in late summer. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants, particularly those in the Proteaceae family. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in the botanical world."
