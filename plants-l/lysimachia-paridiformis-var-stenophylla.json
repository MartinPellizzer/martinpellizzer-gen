    "intro": "Lysimachia paridiformis var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved yellow archangel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in damp, temperate regions."
