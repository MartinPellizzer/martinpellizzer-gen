    "intro": "Leucadendron rubricallosum, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that resemble poker chips, hence its common name. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
