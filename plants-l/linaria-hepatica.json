    "intro": "Linaria hepatica, commonly known as the liverwort orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange. Linaria hepatica is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
