    "intro": "Loeselia glandulosa subsp. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered glandular loeselia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are glandular-pubescent, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
