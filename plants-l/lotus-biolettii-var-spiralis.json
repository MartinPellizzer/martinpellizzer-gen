    "intro": "Lotus biolettii var. spiralis, commonly known as spiral lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in clear, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in rocky stream beds. Its flowers are typically pink or white, blooming during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
