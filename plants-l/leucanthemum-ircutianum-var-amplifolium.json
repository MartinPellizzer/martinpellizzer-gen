    "intro": "Leucanthemum ircutianum var. amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marguerite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that bear numerous white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
