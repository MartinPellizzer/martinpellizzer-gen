    "intro": "Lysionotus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily-of-the-nile, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
