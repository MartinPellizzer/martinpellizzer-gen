    "intro": "Lindernia cyrtotricha, commonly known as the woolly lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a woolly appearance. Lindernia cyrtotricha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
