    "intro": "Lupinus kalenbornorum, commonly known as the Kalenborn's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus kalenbornorum is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and along streambanks. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
