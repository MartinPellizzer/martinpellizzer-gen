    "intro": "Lagenocarpus bifidus, commonly known as the bifid fruit plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated fruits, which split into two parts at maturity. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
