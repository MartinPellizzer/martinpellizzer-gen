    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. brachyodon, commonly known as the short-stalked bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its small, seed-like fruits are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species."
