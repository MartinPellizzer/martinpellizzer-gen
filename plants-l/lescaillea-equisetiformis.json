    "intro": "Lescaillea equisetiformis, commonly known as the spike moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that resemble those of horsetails, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has microphylls, which are small, scale-like structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lescaillea equisetiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
