    "intro": "Lomandra tropica, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a clump, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikes at the ends of the stems. Lomandra tropica is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is also drought-resistant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
