    "intro": "Lagrezia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
