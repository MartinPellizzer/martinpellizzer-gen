    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum subsp. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. This subspecies is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It exhibits a more wild morphology compared to cultivated tomatoes, with hairy stems and smaller leaves. The plant is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve resilience in tomato crops."
