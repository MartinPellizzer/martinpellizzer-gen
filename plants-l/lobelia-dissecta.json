It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lobelia dissecta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
