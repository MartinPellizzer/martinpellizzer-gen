    "intro": "Lindsaea odontolabia, commonly known as the toothed lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
