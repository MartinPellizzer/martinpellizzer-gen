The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and produces small, white or pale purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its stems are upright and branched. Lunaria is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
