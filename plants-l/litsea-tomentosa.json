    "intro": "Litsea tomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or hairy-laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Litsea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for landscaping purposes."
