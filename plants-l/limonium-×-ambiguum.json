It is characterized by its striking, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it thrive in saline environments.
