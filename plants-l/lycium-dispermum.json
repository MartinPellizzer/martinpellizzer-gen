It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Lycium dispermum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
