    "intro": "Lygodium radiatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its distinctive, frond-like structures. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, often forming dense mats or cascading vines. The plant features a central, unbranched stem with pinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist, shaded environments. Lygodium radiatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
