    "intro": "Leucheria neaei, commonly known as the Neaei's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, delicate, white or pale pink flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leucheria neaei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
