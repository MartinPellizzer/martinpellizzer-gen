    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus var. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is notable for its extensive, tuberous growth, which aids in nutrient storage and drought tolerance. This variety is adapted to rocky and acidic soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
