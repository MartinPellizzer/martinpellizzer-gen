    "intro": "Lupinus plumosus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lupinus plumosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
