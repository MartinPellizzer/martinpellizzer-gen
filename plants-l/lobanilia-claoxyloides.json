    "intro": "Lobanilia claoxyloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
