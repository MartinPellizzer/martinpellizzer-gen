    "intro": "Lyonia nana, commonly known as dwarf lyonia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Lyonia nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
