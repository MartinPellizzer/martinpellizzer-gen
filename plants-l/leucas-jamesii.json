    "intro": "Leucas jamesii, commonly known as the James's leucas, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, showcasing a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
