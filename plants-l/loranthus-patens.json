    "intro": "Loranthus patens, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a woody stem with small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus patens is found in various regions of Asia and is often considered a symbol of love and fertility in folklore."
