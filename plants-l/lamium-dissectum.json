    "intro": "Lamium dissectum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
