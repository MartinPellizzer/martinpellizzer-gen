    "intro": "Loranthus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in various regions of Asia and is often seen growing on trees like the tamarind and mango."
