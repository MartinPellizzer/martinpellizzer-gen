    "intro": "Leptidium falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Leptidium falcatum is native to North America and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
