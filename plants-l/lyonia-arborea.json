    "intro": "Lyonia arborea, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in association with coniferous trees. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its flowers are white and bell-shaped, appearing in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Lyonia arborea has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
