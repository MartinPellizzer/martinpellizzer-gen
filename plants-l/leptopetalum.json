    "intro": "Leptopetalum, commonly known as the small-petaled plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plants are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. They have evergreen leaves that are usually leathery and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. Leptopetalum species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic soils."
