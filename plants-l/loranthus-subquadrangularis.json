    "intro": "Loranthus subquadrangularis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically found in the wild in regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of parasitic plant biology and ecological interactions."
