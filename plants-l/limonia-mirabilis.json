    "intro": "Limonia mirabilis, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant white flowers and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a thick, bitter rind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of citric acid. Limonia mirabilis thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
