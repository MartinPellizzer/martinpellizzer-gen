    "intro": "Lupinus axillaris, commonly known as the coastal lupin, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, narrow leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers bloom from late winter to early spring. Lupinus axillaris is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to harsh coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
