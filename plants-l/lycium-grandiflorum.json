    "intro": "Lycium grandiflorum, commonly known as the largeflower lycium or the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium grandiflorum is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
