It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Lactuca gracilis is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance."
