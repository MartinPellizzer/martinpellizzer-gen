    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subvar. speciosum, commonly known as the showy ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, tufted growth habit and bright green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
