    "intro": "Lobivia aureolilacina, commonly known as the golden-lavender lobivia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a low-growing, mound-forming cactus with pale green to bluish-green stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to lavender, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
