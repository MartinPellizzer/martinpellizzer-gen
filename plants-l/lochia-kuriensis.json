    "intro": "Lochia kuriensis, commonly known as the Kuriensis bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and a single, showy red or pink flower that blooms in the spring. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains several small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
