    "intro": "Lachnopylis mannii, commonly known as the manna lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which often has a powdery coating of wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
