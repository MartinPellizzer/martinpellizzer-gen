It is characterized by its delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. Limonium rubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
