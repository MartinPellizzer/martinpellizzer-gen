    "intro": "Lycopodium inundatum var. bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wet, acidic soils. The plant features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and slightly glossy, with a distinct, slender stem. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cone-like structures called strobila. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and along stream banks."
