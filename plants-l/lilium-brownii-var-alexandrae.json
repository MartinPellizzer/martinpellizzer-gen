    "intro": "Lilium brownii var. alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying a mix of white, pink, and red hues. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding a dramatic presence to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
