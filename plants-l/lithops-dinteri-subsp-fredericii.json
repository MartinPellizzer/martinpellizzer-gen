    "intro": "Lithops dinteri subsp. fredericii, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lithops dinteri subsp. fredericii is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
