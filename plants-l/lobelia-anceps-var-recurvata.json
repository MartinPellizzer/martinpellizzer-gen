It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens.
