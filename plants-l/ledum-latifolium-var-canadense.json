    "intro": "Ledum latifolium var. canadense, commonly known as Canadian rosebay, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as bogs and wetlands. Its foliage contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
