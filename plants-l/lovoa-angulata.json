    "intro": "Lovoa angulata, commonly known as the angular lovoa, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its angular, often thorned branches and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
