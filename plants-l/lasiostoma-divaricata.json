    "intro": "Lasiostoma divaricata, commonly known as the variable mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Lasiostoma divaricata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the health of its host trees."
