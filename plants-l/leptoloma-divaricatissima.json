It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-valved schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Leptoloma divaricatissima is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks."
