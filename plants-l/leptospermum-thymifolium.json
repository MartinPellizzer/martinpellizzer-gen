    "intro": "Leptospermum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
