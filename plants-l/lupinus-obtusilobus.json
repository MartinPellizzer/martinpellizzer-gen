It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus obtusilobus is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in its native environment."
