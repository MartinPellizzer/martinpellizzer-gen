    "intro": "Lucuma bullata, commonly known as the golden fruit tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, yellow-orange fruits that resemble a cross between a chestnut and a citrus fruit. The plant is known for its ornamental value, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches full maturity, often in late summer or early autumn. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential use in both ornamental gardening and traditional medicine."
