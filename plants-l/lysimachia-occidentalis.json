It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense ground cover."
