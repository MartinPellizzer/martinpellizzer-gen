    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. eichleri, commonly known as the Eichleri's clubmoss, is a variant of the common ground-pine. It is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a mat on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory plant communities in certain ecosystems."
