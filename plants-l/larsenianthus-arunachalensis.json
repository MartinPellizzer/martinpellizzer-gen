    "intro": "Larsenianthus arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of mountain forests and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its region."
