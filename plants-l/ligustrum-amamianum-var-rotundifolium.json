It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in horticulture for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
