It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features small, yellow flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
