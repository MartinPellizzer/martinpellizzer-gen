    "intro": "Lycaste schilleriana var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered lycaste, is a hybrid orchid species originating from the hybridization of Lycaste schilleriana and Lycaste skinneri. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to rose-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant features a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its native tropical and subtropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
