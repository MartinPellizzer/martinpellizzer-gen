    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mossy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, often in crevices or on cliffs, where it receives minimal soil. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its ornamental value in rock gardens."
