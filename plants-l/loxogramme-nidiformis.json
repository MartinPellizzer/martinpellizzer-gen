It is characterized by its distinctive, rosette-like fronds that form a dense, nest-shaped structure. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that supports the clustered fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a smooth surface. Loxogramme nidiformis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
