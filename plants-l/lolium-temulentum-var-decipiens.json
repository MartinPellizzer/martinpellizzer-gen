    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. decipiens, commonly known as \"false wheatgrass,\" is a variant of the annual grass species Lolium temulentum. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other similar grasses. This variant is notable for its potential allelopathic properties, which may inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
