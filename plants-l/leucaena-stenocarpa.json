    "intro": "Leucaena stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing compressed, dark brown seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Leucaena stenocarpa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
