    "intro": "Lepanthes pergracilis, commonly known as the slender violet orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive violet hue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes pergracilis is considered a conservation concern."
