    "intro": "Leptochloa grandiglumis, commonly known as the large glume grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive, elongated glumes. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptochloa grandiglumis is often used in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
