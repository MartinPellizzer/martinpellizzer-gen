    "intro": "Lemnopsis major, commonly known as the greater water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that are typically divided into two or more lobes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its leaves. Lemnopsis major plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
