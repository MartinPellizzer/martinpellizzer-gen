It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves and has a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. Lycopsis echioides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
