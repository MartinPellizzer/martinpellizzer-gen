    "intro": "Litobrochia tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted brochidium, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in sparse, white woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its arid habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. Litobrochia tripartita is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
