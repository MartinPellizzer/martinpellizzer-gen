    "intro": "Larbrea, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its stems are thick and succulent, storing water to survive droughts. Larbrea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
