    "intro": "Lycopodium nidiforme, commonly known as the nest clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, that contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or forested areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
