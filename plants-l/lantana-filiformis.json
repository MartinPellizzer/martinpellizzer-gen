    "intro": "Lantana filiformis, commonly known as the common lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
