It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
