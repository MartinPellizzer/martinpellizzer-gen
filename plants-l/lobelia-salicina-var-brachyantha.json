    "intro": "Lobelia salicina var. brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cardinal flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
