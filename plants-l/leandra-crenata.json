    "intro": "Leandra crenata, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent central boss. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Leandra crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
