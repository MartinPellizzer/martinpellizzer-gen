    "intro": "Lindera pilosa, commonly known as Chinese sweet pepper or Chinese cinnamon, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its aromatic leaves and berries have been used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Lindera pilosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
