    "intro": "Lotoxalis pseudosepium, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellowish color, though it is generally not consumed by humans due to its mild toxicity."
