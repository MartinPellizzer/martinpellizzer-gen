    "intro": "Loasa acaulis, commonly known as the rock loasa, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and is typically found growing on rocky slopes or in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Loasa acaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
