It features whorled leaves and produces spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
