It is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or on cliffs. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
