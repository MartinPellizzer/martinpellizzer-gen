    "intro": "Lygodium commutatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and climb over other vegetation. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium commutatum is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and swamps."
