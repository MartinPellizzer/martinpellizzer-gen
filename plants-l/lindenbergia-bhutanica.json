    "intro": "Lindenbergia bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Lindenbergia bhutanica is often found growing in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
