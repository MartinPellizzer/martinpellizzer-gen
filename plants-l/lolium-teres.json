    "intro": "Lolium teres, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and fine blades, making it a popular choice for lawns and golf courses. The plant has a rhizomatous and stolonal growth habit, allowing it to spread and form a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, with a bluish-green coloration. Lolium teres is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to frequent mowing."
