    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis var. subalpinus, commonly known as alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or in ornamental gardens."
