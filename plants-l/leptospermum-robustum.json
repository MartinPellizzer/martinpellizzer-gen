    "intro": "Leptospermum robustum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Leptospermum robustum is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
