    "intro": "Lophocereus marginatus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
