    "intro": "Linaria campyloceras, commonly known as the woolly toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, compact foliage and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
