    "intro": "Leptospermum flavescens var. commune, commonly known as the yellow tea tree, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by nectar-feeding insects. Its foliage is used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is also cultivated for its aromatic oils. The species is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments."
