    "intro": "Lachnagrostis roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with limited soil coverage. Lachnagrostis roylei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
