    "intro": "Lamium maculatum proles hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy leaf dead nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-veined, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant, decorative plants."
