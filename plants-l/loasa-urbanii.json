    "intro": "Loasa urbanii, commonly known as the desert loasa, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Loasa urbanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
