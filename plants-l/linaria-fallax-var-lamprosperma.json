It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with two lips and five stamens, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated with caution."
