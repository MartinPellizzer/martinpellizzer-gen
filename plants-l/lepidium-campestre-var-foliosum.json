    "intro": "Lepidium campestre var. foliosum, commonly known as field peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where the soil is disturbed. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a basal rosette growth habit."
