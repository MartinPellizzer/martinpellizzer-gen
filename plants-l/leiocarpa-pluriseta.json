    "intro": "Leiocarpa pluriseta, commonly known as the hairy cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. It typically grows on rocky substrates in temperate regions, forming a mat of tightly packed thallus. The plant has a pale to yellowish-green upper surface with a distinctive, hairy texture on the lower surface. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are small and disc-shaped, often with a smooth margin. Leiocarpa pluriseta is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a common indicator species in certain ecosystems."
