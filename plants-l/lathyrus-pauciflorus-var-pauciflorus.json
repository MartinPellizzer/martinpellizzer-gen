    "intro": "Lathyrus pauciflorus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered vetch, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, ovate leaflets. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, borne in racemes along the stem, and are attractive to pollinators. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
