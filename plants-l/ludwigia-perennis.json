    "intro": "Ludwigia perennis, commonly known as the perennial Ludwigia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features dark green, elongated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems. Ludwigia perennis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support aquatic life."
