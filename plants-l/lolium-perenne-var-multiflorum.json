    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. multiflorum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, coarse leaves, and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both temperate and subtropical climates. It is often used in pastures, lawns, and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment. However, some varieties may contain toxic endophytic fungi, which can affect livestock grazing."
