    "intro": "Limnanthemum nymphaeifolium, commonly known as the water lily-leaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the surface of still water. Its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in muddy substrates of ponds and lakes. The flowers close during the day, making it a unique example of nyctinasty in the botanical world."
