    "intro": "Lepidaploa ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's lepidaploa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidaploa ferreyrae is considered a species of conservation concern."
