    "intro": "Lythrum catinense, commonly known as narrow-leaf crimson flame, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lythraceae family, which includes plants known for their showy flowers and often wetland habitats. The plant produces striking spikes of bright red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Lythrum catinense thrives in moist soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
