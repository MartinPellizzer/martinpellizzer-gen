    "intro": "Lobelia glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
