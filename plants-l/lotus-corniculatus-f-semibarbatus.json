    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. semibarbatus, commonly known as the semi-barbed lotus, is a subspecies of the common bird's-foot trefoil. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and distinctive, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seed pods are slender and curved, with a unique semi-barbed structure that aids in seed dispersal. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
