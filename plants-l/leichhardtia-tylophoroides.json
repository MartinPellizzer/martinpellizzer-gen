It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and forest understoreys. It has a creeping growth habit with underground rhizomes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are often followed by small, triangular seed pods that release seeds when mature."
