    "intro": "Lycopodioides goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate rainforests or along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
