    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, erect, and densely branched stems. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically clustered in short, compact clusters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
