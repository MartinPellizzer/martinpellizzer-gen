    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. tenue, commonly known as slender perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and compact growth habit. This variety is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its high drought tolerance and dense sod-forming ability. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively resistant to diseases and pests."
