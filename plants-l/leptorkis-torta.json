    "intro": "Leptorkis torta, commonly known as the twisted leaf fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and spirally twisted, forming a compact, often compacted rosette shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
