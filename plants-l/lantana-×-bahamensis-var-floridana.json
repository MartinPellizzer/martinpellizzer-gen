    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 bahamensis var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to orange, yellow, and red, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
