    "intro": "Lomandra nana, commonly known as the dwarf leek lily, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It features a dense, grass-like rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in a spike at the center of the foliage. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Lomandra nana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden conditions."
