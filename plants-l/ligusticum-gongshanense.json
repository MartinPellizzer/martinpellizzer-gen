    "intro": "Ligusticum gongshanense, commonly known as Gongshan lovage, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that emit a strong, spicy odor. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in complex umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
