It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is known for its slender, hairy leaves that are often curved at the tips. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Liabum subcirrhosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
