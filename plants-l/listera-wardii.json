    "intro": "Listera wardii, commonly known as the Ward's spring beauty, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, thriving in rich, well-drained soil. Listera wardii is a perennial herb that blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of trees fully develops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
