    "intro": "Lotus albarracinensis, commonly known as the Albaracin lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pale pink petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
