    "intro": "Lathyrus californicus, commonly known as the California vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and the stems are often hairy. Lathyrus californicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
