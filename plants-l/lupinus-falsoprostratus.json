It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features prostrate or spreading stems that produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to arid environments. Lupinus falsoprostratus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
