    "intro": "Lophiolepis daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale to dark yellow in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
