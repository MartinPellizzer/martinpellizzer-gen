    "intro": "Laseguea erecta subvar. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed laseguea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
