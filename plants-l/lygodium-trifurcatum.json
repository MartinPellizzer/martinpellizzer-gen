    "intro": "Lygodium trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-branched water fern, is a tropical climbing fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Lygodium trifurcatum is also notable for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
