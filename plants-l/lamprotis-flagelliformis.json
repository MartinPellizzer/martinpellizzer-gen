    "intro": "Lamprotis flagelliformis, commonly known as the whip-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that give it its common name. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are often found on the underside of the leaves. Lamprotis flagelliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
