    "intro": "Loasa limata, commonly known as the creeping loasa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant has small, ovate leaves with toothed margins and produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Loasa limata is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
