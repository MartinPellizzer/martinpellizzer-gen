    "intro": "Larnax schjellerupiae, commonly known as the Schjellerup's larnax, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-arranged leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short growing season in its harsh environment. Its root system is highly adapted to absorb nutrients from thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Larnax schjellerupiae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
