    "intro": "Lobivia katagirii var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent stems are ribbed and capable of storing water, a key adaptation to its dry habitat. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
