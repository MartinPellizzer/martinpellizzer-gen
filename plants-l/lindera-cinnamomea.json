    "intro": "Lindera cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for true ferns. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Lindera cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and berries contribute to its ecological and ornamental value in native gardens."
