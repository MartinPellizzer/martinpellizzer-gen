    "intro": "Lupinus helleri, commonly known as Heller's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus helleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
