    "intro": "Ligustrum italicum, commonly known as Italian privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. These flowers are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
