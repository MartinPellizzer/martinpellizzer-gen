    "intro": "Loxogramme grammitoides, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in dense clusters on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, which help it anchor to its substrate. Its leaves are typically two-ranked, with a subdeltate base and a slender, linear blade that is usually less than 10 cm in length. Loxogramme grammitoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests."
