It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
