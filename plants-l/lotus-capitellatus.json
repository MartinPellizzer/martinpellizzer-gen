    "intro": "Lotus capitellatus, commonly known as the dwarf lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically above the water surface. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Lotus capitellatus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
