    "intro": "Liparis dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a rosette of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
