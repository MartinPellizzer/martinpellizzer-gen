    "intro": "Lobivia watadae var. salmonea, commonly known as the pink lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant pink to reddish hue, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its striking coloration and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
