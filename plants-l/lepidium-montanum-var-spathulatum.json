    "intro": "Lepidium montanum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 7,000 feet. Its leaves are lanceolate to spatulate in shape, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. The flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
