    "intro": "Lepidium myriocarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded cress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and its distinctive, highly branched fruiting structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and along roadsides. Due to its unique seed morphology and ecological adaptability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various insects and small animals."
