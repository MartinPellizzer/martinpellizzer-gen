It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in buoyancy. Lipocarpha mexicana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
