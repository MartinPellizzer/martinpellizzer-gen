    "intro": "Laurea tiliifolia, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to reveal spiky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-yellow blooms that appear in the spring. Laurea tiliifolia is often valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
