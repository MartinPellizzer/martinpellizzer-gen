    "intro": "Leocereus bahiensis var. exiguospinus, commonly known as the small-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and sparse, sharp spines. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
