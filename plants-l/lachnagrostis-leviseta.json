    "intro": "Lachnagrostis leviseta, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of fine, hair-like foliage that can reach heights of up to 15 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Lachnagrostis leviseta plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
