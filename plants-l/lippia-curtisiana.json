    "intro": "Lippia curtisiana, commonly known as the Mexican blue verbena, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lippia curtisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
