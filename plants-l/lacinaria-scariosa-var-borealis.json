    "intro": "Lacinaria scariosa var. borealis, commonly known as the northern lacinaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the short summer season. This variant is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, showcasing resilience to low temperatures and strong winds."
