It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite and often have a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where the leaf stalks pass through the stem, creating a unique appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its delicate beauty and adaptability contribute to its ecological and ornamental value."
