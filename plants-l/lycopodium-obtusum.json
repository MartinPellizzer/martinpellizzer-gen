    "intro": "Lycopodium obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium obtusum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
