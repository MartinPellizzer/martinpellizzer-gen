    "intro": "Libocedrus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis incense cedar, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving explosive dehiscence. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and scent, making it a significant resource in local economies. Botanically, it belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is closely related to other members of the genus Libocedrus."
