    "intro": "Lycaste nana, commonly known as the dwarf lycaste, is a compact orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and manageable size, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
