    "intro": "Lactuca retrorsidens, commonly known as the backward-pointing lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and basal rosette of alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lactuca retrorsidens is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations."
