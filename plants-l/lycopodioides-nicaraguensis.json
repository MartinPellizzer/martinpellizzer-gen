    "intro": "Lycopodioides nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Nicaragua. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and plays a vital role in the forest ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
