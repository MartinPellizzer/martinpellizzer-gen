    "intro": "Lygos raetam var. sarcocarpa, commonly known as the rock apple or sarcocarpa, is a variant of the rock apple plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. These berries are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making them valuable in local cuisines. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
