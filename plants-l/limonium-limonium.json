    "intro": "Limonium limonium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Limonium limonium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for various insects."
