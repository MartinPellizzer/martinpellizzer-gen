    "intro": "Limodorum longicornu, commonly known as the long-horned lily, is a striking orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers feature long, slender sepals and petals, with a unique, elongated spur that houses the nectar. Limodorum longicornu is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its beauty and rarity."
