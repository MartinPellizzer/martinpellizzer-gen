    "intro": "Lasiocladus anthospermifolius var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved desert dandelion, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a soft, fuzzy texture. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun."
