It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to rocky substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Lepisorus neolewisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
