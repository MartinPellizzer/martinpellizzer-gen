    "intro": "Lotononis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lotononis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lotononis prostrata is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
