    "intro": "Lepidobolus preissianus, commonly known as the African sandbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient component of dryland ecosystems. Its growth form and foliage make it an important plant for soil stabilization and habitat provision in its native range."
