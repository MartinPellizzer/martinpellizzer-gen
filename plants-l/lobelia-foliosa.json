It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. Lobelia foliosa is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
