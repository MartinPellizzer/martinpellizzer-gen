It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid and semi-arid regions."
