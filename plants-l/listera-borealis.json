    "intro": "Listera borealis, commonly known as the northern basketwart, is a delicate perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Listera borealis is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
