    "intro": "Lathyrus vicioides, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in spikes, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
