It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Lepidium apetalum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, arid environments."
