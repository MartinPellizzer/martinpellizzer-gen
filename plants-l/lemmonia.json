    "intro": "Lemmonia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Lemmonia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
