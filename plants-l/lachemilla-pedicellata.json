    "intro": "Lachemilla pedicellata, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Lachemilla pedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
