    "intro": "Limonium strictissimum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium strictissimum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
