    "intro": "Leontopodium stoechas, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by a ring of pale green bracts. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its ecological significance and cultural symbolism, it is also protected in many regions."
