    "intro": "Leichtlinia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Leichtlinia is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
