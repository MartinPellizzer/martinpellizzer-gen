    "intro": "Lomaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lomaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lomaria pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
