    "intro": "Lycium scoparium var. lineare, commonly known as the linear-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has slender, spiny stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil. Its hardy nature makes it a common sight in coastal and inland areas of southern Australia."
