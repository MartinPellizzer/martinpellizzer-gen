    "intro": "Lastrea adiantiformis, commonly known as the fern moss or creeping fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of true ferns, though it is not a true fern but a bryophyte. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its small, clustered growth habit and intricate leaf structure make it a striking addition to specialized botanical collections. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lastrea adiantiformis is often found in protected or conservation areas."
