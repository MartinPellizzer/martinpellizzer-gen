    "intro": "Lupinus fremontensis, commonly known as the fremont's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus fremontensis plays an important role in its ecosystem by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant species."
