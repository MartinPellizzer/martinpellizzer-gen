    "intro": "Lycianthes polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited nightshade, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a slightly hairy surface. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and birds."
