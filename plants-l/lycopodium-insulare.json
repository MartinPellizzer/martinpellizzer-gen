    "intro": "Lycopodium insulare, commonly known as the island clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stem. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium insulare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early vascular plant evolution."
