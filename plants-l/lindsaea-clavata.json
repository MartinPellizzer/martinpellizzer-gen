    "intro": "Lindsaea clavata, commonly known as the club-moss, is a species of fern ally belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in compact, stalked clusters called strobila. Lindsaea clavata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
