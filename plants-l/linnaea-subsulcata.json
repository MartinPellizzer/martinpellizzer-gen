    "intro": "Linnaea subsulcata, commonly known as the smooth-ribbed twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive twinflower-like inflorescence, where two small, bell-shaped flowers are borne on a single stem. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, slightly wavy margin. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
