    "intro": "Loranthus nestor, commonly known as the royal mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red, are consumed by birds that help disperse its seeds. Loranthus nestor plays a significant role in forest ecosystems as both a parasite and a food source for wildlife."
