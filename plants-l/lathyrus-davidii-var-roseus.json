It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces showy, rose-pink to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional agriculture."
