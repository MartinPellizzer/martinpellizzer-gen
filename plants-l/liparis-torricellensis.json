It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
