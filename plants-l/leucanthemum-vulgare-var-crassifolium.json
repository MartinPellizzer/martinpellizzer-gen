    "intro": "Leucanthemum vulgare var. crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf white daisy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals surrounding a yellow center, with broad, dark green leaves. This variety is a variant of the common dandelion, but it has a more compact growth habit and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
