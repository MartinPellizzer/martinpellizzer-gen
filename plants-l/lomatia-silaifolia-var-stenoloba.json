It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
