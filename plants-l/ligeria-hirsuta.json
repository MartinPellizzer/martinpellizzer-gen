    "intro": "Ligeria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ligeria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ligeria hirsuta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
