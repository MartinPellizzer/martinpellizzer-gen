    "intro": "Lobelia seguinii, commonly known as Seguin's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
