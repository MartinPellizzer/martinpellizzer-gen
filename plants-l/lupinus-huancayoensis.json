    "intro": "Lupinus huancayoensis, commonly known as the Huancayo lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems, which help it survive in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus huancayoensis is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
