    "intro": "Lobivia aurea subsp. fallax, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bright orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on racemes. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to store water. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
