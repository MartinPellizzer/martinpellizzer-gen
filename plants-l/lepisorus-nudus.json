    "intro": "Lepisorus nudus, commonly known as the naked polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
