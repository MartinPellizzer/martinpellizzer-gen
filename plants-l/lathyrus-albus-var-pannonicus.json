    "intro": "Lathyrus albus var. pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by slender, twisted pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems."
