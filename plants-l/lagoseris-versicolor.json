    "intro": "Lagoseris versicolor, commonly known as the variable sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Lagoseris versicolor plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
