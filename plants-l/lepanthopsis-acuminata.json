    "intro": "Lepanthopsis acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained substrates. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in low-light conditions within the understory of tropical rainforests."
