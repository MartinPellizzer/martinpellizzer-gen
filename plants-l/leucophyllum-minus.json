    "intro": "Leucophyllum minus, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
