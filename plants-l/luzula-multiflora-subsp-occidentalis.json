    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western wood rush, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
