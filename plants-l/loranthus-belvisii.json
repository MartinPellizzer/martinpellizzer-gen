    "intro": "Loranthus belvisii, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
