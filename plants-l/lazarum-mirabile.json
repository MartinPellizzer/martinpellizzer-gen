    "intro": "Lazarum mirabile, commonly known as the miracle plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft glow at night, a feature that has intrigued botanists for decades. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific combination of soil pH and moisture levels to flourish. Its unique ability to absorb and store light energy makes it a subject of extensive research in photosynthesis and bioluminescence. Despite its beauty and scientific interest, Lazarum mirabile remains elusive and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
