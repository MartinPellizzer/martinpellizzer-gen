    "intro": "Linum turcomanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan flax, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to dry conditions. Its seeds are used for oil production, similar to other flax species, though it is less commonly cultivated commercially. Linum turcomanicum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
