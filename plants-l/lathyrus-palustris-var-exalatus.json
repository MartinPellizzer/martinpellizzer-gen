    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. exalatus, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supported by tendrils that help it ascend through vegetation. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated and slender growth habit compared to other varieties of Lathyrus palustris."
