    "intro": "Licania parviflora var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it can grow as a shrub or small tree. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
