    "intro": "Limonium roseum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air. Limonium roseum is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and floral arrangements."
