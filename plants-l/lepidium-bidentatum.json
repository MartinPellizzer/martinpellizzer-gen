It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy. Its fruit is a small, dry pod that splits open to release tiny seeds. Peppergrass is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
