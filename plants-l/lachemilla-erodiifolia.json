    "intro": "Lachemilla erodiifolia, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white undersides that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ability to form a lush, ground-covering layer."
