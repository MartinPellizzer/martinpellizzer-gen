It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Limosella americana is adapted to harsh, salty environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
