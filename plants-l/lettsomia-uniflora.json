    "intro": "Lettsomia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lettsom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pale blue and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces a single flower per stem, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Lettsomia uniflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
