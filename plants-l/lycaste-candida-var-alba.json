    "intro": "Lycaste candida var. alba, commonly known as the white lycaste, is a rare and highly prized orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale green to white-colored pseudobulbs and long, slender leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It requires high humidity, bright indirect light, and well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced orchid growers."
