    "intro": "Lycopodium carinatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, which are typically bright green and arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
