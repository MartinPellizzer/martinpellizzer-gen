    "intro": "Lithops marginata, commonly known as the narrow-margin stone plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leaf-like structures called \"tubercles,\" which are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. The plant's leaves are typically green with white or yellow margins, providing a camouflage effect in its natural habitat. It blooms with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Lithops marginata is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
