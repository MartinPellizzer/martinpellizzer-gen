    "intro": "Lellingeria boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's lellingeria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lellingeria boivinii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
