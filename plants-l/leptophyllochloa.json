It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its reproductive structures include spikelets with two to three florets, which are wind-pollinated. Leptophyllochloa species are often used in ecological studies due to their adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
