    "intro": "Lupinus luisanae var. ocetensis, commonly known as the Occitan lupin, is a perennial legume native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
