    "intro": "Lysionotus hagiangensis, commonly known as the Hagiang star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are oval in shape, with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
