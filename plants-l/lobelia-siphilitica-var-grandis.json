    "intro": "Lobelia siphilitica var. grandis, commonly known as great lobelia, is a striking perennial wildflower native to eastern North America. It features showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom from June to September, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and hairy. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with syphilis, though it has no medicinal connection to the disease."
