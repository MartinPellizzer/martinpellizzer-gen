    "intro": "Lomatium alatum, commonly known as the western cowparsnip, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a tall, hollow stem with distinctive, fern-like leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lomatium alatum thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings."
