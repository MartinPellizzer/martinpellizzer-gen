    "intro": "Lepanthes rubrolineata, commonly known as the red-lined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive red or pink stripe along the lip. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes rubrolineata is considered endangered in many regions."
