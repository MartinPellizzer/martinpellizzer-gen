    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. trichocalyx, commonly known as the hairy-flowered lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched inflorescence and hairy foliage, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
