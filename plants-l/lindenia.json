    "intro": "Lindenia, commonly known as the white linden, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their fragrant, small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Lindenia species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, winged fruits called samaras. These plants are often valued for their ornamental appeal and historical uses in traditional medicine."
