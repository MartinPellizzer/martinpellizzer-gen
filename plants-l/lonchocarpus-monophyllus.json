    "intro": "Lonchocarpus monophyllus, commonly known as the white snakeroot, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
