    "intro": "Lepanthes lloensis, commonly known as the Lloense Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes lloensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare orchid species."
