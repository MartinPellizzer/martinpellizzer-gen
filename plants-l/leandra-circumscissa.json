The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to its arid habitat. Leandra circumscissa is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
