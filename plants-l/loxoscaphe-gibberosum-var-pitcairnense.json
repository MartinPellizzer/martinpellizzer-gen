    "intro": "Loxoscaphe gibberosum var. pitcairnense, commonly known as the Pitcairn lichen, is a rare foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, rugged, granular texture. The lower surface is pale and covered with small, rounded lobes and a network of fine, thread-like structures. It is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces in remote island locations. This variant is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
