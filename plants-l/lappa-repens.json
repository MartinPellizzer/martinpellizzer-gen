    "intro": "Lappa repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern near the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Lappa repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
