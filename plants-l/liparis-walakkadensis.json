    "intro": "Liparis walakkadensis, commonly known as the Walakkad orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying orchid diversity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and over-collection."
