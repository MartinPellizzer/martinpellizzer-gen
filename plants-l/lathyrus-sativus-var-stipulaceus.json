    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. stipulaceus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for both agricultural and ornamental purposes."
