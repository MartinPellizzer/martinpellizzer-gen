    "intro": "Lilium bonatii, commonly known as the Bonatti lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, preferring cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are sturdy and upright. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
