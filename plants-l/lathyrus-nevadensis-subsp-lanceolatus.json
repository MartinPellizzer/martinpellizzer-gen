    "intro": "Lathyrus nevadensis subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in its growth along vegetation. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
