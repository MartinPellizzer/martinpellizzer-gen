    "intro": "Lastrea membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous lastrea, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded caudex with smooth, pale green skin that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
