    "intro": "Linnaea subjugosa, commonly known as the humble twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the summer. Linnaea subjugosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
