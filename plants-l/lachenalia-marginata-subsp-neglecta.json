    "intro": "Lachenalia marginata subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-margin lachenalia, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features linear, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. It is often grown as an ornamental in rock gardens due to its striking appearance and hardiness. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf margins compared to other varieties within the Lachenalia genus."
