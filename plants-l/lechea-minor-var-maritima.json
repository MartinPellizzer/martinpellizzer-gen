    "intro": "Lechea minor var. maritima, commonly known as the sea lechea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which stabilize sandy soils along the shore. The species is adapted to salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
