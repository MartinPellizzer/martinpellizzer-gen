    "intro": "Lepidium triandrum, commonly known as the three-stamen cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in fields and along roadsides. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy. Lepidium triandrum is characterized by its three stamens in each flower, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America."
