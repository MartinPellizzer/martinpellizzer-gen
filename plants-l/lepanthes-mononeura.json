    "intro": "Lepanthes mononeura, commonly known as the single-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that display a wide range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make it an important subject in botanical studies."
