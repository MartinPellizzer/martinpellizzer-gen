    "intro": "Lindsaea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its intricate morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
