    "intro": "Lycopodioides mannii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, a common strategy among primitive vascular plants. Lycopodioides mannii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its ecosystem."
