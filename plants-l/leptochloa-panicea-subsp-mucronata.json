    "intro": "Leptochloa panicea subsp. mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This subspecies is characterized by its short, bluntly pointed lemma tips, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
