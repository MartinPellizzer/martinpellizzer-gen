    "intro": "Lobelia dortmanna var. decolor, commonly known as the pale lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is closely related to other lobelia species and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable plant for ecological studies and native garden cultivation."
