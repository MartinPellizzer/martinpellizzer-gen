    "intro": "Liparis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, often with a slight purple or reddish hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Liparis triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
