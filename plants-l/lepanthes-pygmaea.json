    "intro": "Lepanthes pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Lepanthes pygmaea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
