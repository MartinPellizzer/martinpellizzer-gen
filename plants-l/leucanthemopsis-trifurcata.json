It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
