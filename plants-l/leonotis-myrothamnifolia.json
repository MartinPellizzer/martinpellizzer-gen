    "intro": "Leonotis myrothamnifolia, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of bright orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
