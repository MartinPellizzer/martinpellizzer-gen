    "intro": "Lobelia agrestis, commonly known as the marsh lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Lobelia agrestis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
