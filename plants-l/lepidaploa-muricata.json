    "intro": "Lepidaploa muricata, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, leathery leaves and small, delicate orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
