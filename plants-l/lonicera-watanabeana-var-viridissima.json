It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb using tendrils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often managed carefully in natural habitats."
