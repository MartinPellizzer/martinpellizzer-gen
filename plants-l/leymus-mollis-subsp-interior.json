    "intro": "Leymus mollis subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This species typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as sandy soils and gravelly plains. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
