    "intro": "Laplacea marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Laplacea marginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
