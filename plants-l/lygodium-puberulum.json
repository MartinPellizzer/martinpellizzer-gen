    "intro": "Lygodium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of soft, hairy structures on its fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a feathery appearance, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Lygodium puberulum is often found in forest understories where it can climb trees or other vegetation to reach light."
