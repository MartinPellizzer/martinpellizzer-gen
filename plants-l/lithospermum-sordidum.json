    "intro": "Lithospermum sordidum, commonly known as the dirty rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces a distinctive red or orange seed capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing its seeds. Lithospermum sordidum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on limestone or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
