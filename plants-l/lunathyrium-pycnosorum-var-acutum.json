    "intro": "Lunathyrium pycnosorum var. acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved mooncup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
