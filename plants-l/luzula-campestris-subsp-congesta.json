    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. congesta, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is often mistaken for a sedges or rushes due to its appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, greenish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the dense arrangement of its flowering structures."
