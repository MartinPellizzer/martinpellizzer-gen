It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden settings."
