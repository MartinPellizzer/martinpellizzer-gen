    "intro": "Libertia formosa var. crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed libertia, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features robust, fleshy leaves that are typically broader and more pronounced than those of the typical variety. The plant produces tall, upright stems adorned with clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
