    "intro": "Loranthus mitchellianus, commonly known as the Mitchell's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating the plant's propagation. Loranthus mitchellianus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive."
