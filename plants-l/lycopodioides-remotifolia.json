    "intro": "Lycopodioides remotifolia, commonly known as the remote leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around its slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among primitive vascular plants. Lycopodioides remotifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
