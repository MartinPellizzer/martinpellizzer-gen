    "intro": "Ludwigia \u00d7 lacustris, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots hanging below. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or white. It is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae. However, it can become invasive in natural water bodies if not managed properly."
