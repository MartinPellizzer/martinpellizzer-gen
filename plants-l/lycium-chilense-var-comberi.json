    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. comberi, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. This species is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion."
