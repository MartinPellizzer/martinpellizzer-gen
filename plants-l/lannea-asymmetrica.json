    "intro": "Lannea asymmetrica, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. Lannea asymmetrica plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
