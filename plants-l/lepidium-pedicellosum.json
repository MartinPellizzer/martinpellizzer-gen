    "intro": "Lepidium pedicellosum, commonly known as the clustered peppergrass, is a small flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among members of the Brassicaceae family. Lepidium pedicellosum thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
