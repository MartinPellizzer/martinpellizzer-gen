    "intro": "Lathyrus lineatus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
