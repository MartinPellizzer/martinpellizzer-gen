    "intro": "Lobivia rebutioides var. sublimiflora, commonly known as the Snowy Lobivia, is a rare and striking cacti species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear pale blue or violet flowers, which open during the cooler hours of dawn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued by cactus enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
