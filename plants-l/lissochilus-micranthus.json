    "intro": "Lissochilus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered liana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant produces intricate, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with a distinct lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its overall vine-like appearance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
