    "intro": "Leucanthemum visianii, commonly known as the Visianii's Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically surrounded by a layer of fuzzy, woolly leaves. The plant thrives in alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
