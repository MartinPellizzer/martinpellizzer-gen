    "intro": "Leontopodium sinense, commonly known as the Chinese edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale pink flower heads surrounded by silky, white bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
