It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, black berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
