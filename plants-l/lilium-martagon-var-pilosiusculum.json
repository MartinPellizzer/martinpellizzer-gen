    "intro": "Lilium martagon var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, nodding, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red, often with a white or pale pink base. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous roots that store nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique flower shape and long blooming period."
