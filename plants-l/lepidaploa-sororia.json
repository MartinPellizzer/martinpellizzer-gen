The plant features upright stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Lepidaploa sororia produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions, it is considered an important species in ecological studies of alpine flora."
