    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 hiratukae, commonly known as the Japanese sericea lespedeza, is a hybrid perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, clustered pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. Lespedeza \u00d7 hiratukae is often found in disturbed soils and is used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardy nature. It is also valued in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
