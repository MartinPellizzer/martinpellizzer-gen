    "intro": "Lagopus arvensis, commonly known as the common sandspur, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 30 cm tall, characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a spiny capsule, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. Lagopus arvensis is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats where it can establish quickly."
