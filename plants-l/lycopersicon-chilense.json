It is a herbaceous annual plant with hairy stems and leaves that are typically lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, round fruits similar to cultivated tomatoes. Lycopersicon chilense is valued for its genetic diversity and is often used in breeding programs to improve cultivated tomato varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
