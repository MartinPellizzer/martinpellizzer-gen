    "intro": "Lychnis nivalis, commonly known as snowberry or white campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Lychnis nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in harsh conditions."
