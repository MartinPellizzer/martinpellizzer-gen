    "intro": "Loranthus heteranthus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in dispersal by birds. It is found in various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
