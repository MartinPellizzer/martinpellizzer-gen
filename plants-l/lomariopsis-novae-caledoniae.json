    "intro": "Lomariopsis novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia fern, is a tropical fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Lomariopsis novae-caledoniae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
