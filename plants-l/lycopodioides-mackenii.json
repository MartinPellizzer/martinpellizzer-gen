    "intro": "Lycopodioides mackenii, commonly known as the Mackenzie clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodioides mackenii is native to specific regions of Australia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
