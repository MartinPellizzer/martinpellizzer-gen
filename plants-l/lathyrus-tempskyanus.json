    "intro": "Lathyrus tempskyanus, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments. Lathyrus tempskyanus is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
