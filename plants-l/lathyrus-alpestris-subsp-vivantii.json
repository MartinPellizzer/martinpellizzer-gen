    "intro": "Lathyrus alpestris subsp. vivantii, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain small, elongated seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
