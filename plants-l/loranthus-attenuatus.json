    "intro": "Loranthus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of woody hosts, such as trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are scale-like and reduced, and it relies entirely on its host for survival. Loranthus attenuatus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can thrive on a variety of host species."
