    "intro": "Lepisorus clathratus var. namegatae, commonly known as the Namegata fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The fronds are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
