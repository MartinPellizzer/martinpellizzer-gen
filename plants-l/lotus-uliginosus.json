    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It thrives in shallow water and mud, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, and it produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Lotus uliginosus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional use in some cultures."
