    "intro": "Lobelia pentheri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lobelia pentheri is adapted to high altitudes and is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
