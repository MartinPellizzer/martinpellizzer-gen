    "intro": "Lemeltonia scaligera, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
