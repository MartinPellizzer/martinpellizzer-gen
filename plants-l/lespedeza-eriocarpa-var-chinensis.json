    "intro": "Lespedeza eriocarpa var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
