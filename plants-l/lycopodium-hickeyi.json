    "intro": "Lycopodium hickeyi, commonly known as the Hickey's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of scale-like leaves, which give it a compact, moss-like appearance. This species is native to the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lycopodium hickeyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
