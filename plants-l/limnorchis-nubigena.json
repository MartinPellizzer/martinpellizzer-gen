    "intro": "Limnorchis nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the short growing season. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its unique adaptation to high-altitude conditions makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
