    "intro": "Lilium coridion f. partheneion, commonly known as the Partheneion lily, is a rare and elegant botanical variant of the Turk's\u5e3d lily. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a subtle pinkish tinge, which distinguish it from its more common relatives. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus, this plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, cup-shaped flowers, often blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
