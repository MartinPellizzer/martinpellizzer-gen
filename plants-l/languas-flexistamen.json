    "intro": "Languas flexistamen, commonly known as the wavy-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, flexible stems that can bend and twist in response to wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its adaptive strategies in harsh environments."
