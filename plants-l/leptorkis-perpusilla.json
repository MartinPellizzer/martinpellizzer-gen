It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
