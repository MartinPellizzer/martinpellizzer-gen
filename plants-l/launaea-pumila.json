    "intro": "Launaea pumila, commonly known as the woolly leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant is notable for its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Launaea pumila is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
