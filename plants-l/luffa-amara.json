    "intro": "Luffa amara, commonly known as bitter luffa, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, trailing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fruits that are initially green and turn yellow or orange as they mature. The fruit's interior contains a spongy, fibrous material that becomes woody over time. Luffa amara is cultivated for its edible young fruits and its fibrous interior, which can be used as a natural sponge."
