    "intro": "Lepanthes yunckeri, commonly known as the Yuncker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes yunckeri prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
