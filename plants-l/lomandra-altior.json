    "intro": "Lomandra altior, commonly known as the tall leek lomandra, is a perennial evergreen herb native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Lomandra altior is adapted to well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. It also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
