    "intro": "Lepanthes davidii, commonly known as the David's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous blooms. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, Lepanthes davidii is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts and is considered a rare and delicate species."
