    "intro": "Leptogramma liui, commonly known as the Liui's leptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leptogramma liui is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
