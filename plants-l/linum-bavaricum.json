It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are small and oval. Linum bavaricum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for commercial flax production."
