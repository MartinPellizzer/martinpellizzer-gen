    "intro": "Lagerstroemia duperreana var. duperreana, commonly known as the red flame flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It features striking, papery red bracts that appear in late spring, often mistaken for flowers, and are borne on long, drooping clusters. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green above and pale beneath, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its unique foliage and vibrant bracts make it a standout in gardens and landscapes."
