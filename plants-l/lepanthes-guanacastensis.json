It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Lepanthes guanacastensis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
