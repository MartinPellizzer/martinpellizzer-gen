    "intro": "Leucosyke leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal flowers that open at dusk. The plant typically grows in forest understories and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
