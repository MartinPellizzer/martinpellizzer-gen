    "intro": "Lepanthes hemirhoda, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper shape, and its relatively small size. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as beetles and flies, which are attracted to its unique structure and scent. Lepanthes hemirhoda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
