    "intro": "Lotus wrangelianus, commonly known as Wrangel's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Arctic regions of Siberia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater lakes and ponds, often in areas with strong sunlight exposure. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
