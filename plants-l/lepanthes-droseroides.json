    "intro": "Lepanthes droseroides, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, sticky, glandular hairs on the petals, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant scent. Lepanthes droseroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
