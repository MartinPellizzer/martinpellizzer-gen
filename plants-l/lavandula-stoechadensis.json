    "intro": "Lavandula stoechadensis, commonly known as Scottish lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its silver-gray foliage and aromatic properties make it a distinctive feature of its habitat. It is also valued for its use in essential oils and traditional herbal medicine."
