    "intro": "Limnochloa multicaulis, commonly known as the swamp grass or water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or just above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Limnochloa multicaulis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
