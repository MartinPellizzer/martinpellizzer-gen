It features slender, arching stems that are often covered with small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for ornamental horticulture."
