    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum var. shiroumense, commonly known as the white-flowered edelweiss, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and a single, showy white flower with prominent central sepals. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Due to its fragility, it is often found in protected natural reserves."
