    "intro": "Lepanthes mariae, commonly known as the Marie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Lepanthes mariae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
