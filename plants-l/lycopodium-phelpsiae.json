    "intro": "Lycopodium phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodium phelpsiae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
