    "intro": "Loranthus lowii, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by animals, which then germinate on the bark of host trees. Loranthus lowii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
