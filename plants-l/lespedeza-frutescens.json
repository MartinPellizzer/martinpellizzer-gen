    "intro": "Lespedeza frutescens, commonly known as partridge pea, is a perennial legume native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria. Lespedeza frutescens is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for wildlife."
