    "intro": "Lindsaea lunulata, commonly known as the moon-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from the soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Lindsaea lunulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
