It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that are often dotted with white or pale spots. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
