    "intro": "Lycopodium inundatum var. rigidium, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and features small, scale-like leaves that form a mat on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant."
