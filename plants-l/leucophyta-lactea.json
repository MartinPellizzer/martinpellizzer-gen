    "intro": "Leucophyta lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds such as cardiac glycosides. The plant typically has opposite, ovate leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Leucophyta lactea plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its foliage for laying eggs."
