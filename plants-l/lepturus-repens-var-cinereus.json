    "intro": "Lepturus repens var. cinereus, commonly known as the silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
