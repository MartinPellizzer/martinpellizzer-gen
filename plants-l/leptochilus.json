    "intro": "Leptochilus, commonly known as the small-leafed rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous species that thrive in rocky or alpine environments. They are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have four petals. Leptochilus species are usually found in temperate regions and are adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Their botanical features make them important components of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
