    "intro": "Lotus siliquosus var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea lotus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore, often in areas with high salt exposure. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod-like structure, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
