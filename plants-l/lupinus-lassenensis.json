    "intro": "Lupinus lassenensis, commonly known as the Lassen's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus lassenensis has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
