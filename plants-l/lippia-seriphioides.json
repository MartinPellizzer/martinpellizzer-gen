    "intro": "Lippia seriphioides, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, mint-like aroma. Lippia seriphioides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
