    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum pyriforme, commonly known as the pear-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a smooth, pale green to yellowish upper surface. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to pollution, it serves as an indicator species for environmental health."
