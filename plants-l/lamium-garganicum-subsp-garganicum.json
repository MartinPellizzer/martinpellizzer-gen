It features oval, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its square stems. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, high-altitude climates."
