    "intro": "Lithocardium crenatum, commonly known as the crested rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, rounded, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lithocardium crenatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant plant."
