    "intro": "Lupulus communis, commonly known as the common hop, is a flowering plant in the hop family, Humulus. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America and is characterized by its vigorous climbing growth habit. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which are used in brewing beer. These cones contain essential oils and lupulins, which contribute to the bitterness and aroma of beer. Lupulus communis thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
