    "intro": "Lotus medicaginoides, commonly known as the Indian lotus or sacred lotus, is a water-lily species native to the wetlands of southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often during the summer months. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or aquatic environments. Lotus medicaginoides is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and medicinal significance in many traditional practices."
