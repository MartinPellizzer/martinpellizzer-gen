    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. miniatum, commonly known as the miniature clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures, typically growing close to the ground. Native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions, this plant thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on specialized branches and contain spores for propagation. Due to its small size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
