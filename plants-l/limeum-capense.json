    "intro": "Limeum capense, commonly known as the Cape lime, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Limeum capense is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
