    "intro": "Loiseleuria, commonly known as the common lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is found in various environments, including tree bark, soil, and rocks, and thrives in moist, shaded areas. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal and algal components. Loiseleuria species are often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to their sensitivity to pollutants. They play an important role in nutrient cycling and provide habitats for small invertebrates."
