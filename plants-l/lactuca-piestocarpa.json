    "intro": "Lactuca piestocarpa, commonly known as the mountain lettuce, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
