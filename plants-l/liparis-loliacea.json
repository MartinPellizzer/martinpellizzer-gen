    "intro": "Liparis loliacea, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and moist woodlands in temperate regions. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its lip-shaped petals and is often found in shaded, humid environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The marsh helleborine is also noted for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
