    "intro": "Lycopodiella \u00d7 copelandii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella tamariscina. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Lycopodiella \u00d7 copelandii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
