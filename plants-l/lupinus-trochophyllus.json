It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant features erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a feathery appearance. Its showy blue to violet pea-like flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus trochophyllus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
