    "intro": "Lathyrus laxiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lathyrus laxiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
