    "intro": "Limodorum chloidophyllum, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with a distinctive hooded structure, which is typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
