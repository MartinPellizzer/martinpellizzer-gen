    "intro": "Lupinus richardianus, commonly known as the richardian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus richardianus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits the surrounding ecosystem."
