    "intro": "Leymus \u00d7 sphacelatus, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from Leymus arenarius and Leymus triticoides. It is native to the Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for both agricultural and ecological restoration purposes. Its botanical features make it valuable for forage, erosion control, and as a potential source of bioenergy."
