    "intro": "Lipotactes, commonly known as the buttercup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a distinctive lobed or divided appearance. Lipotactes species are often found in moist, temperate regions and are known for their toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation. These plants play an important role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
