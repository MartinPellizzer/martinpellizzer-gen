    "intro": "Laelia podocarpa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, and they bloom during the cooler months. Laelia podocarpa is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires specific conditions to thrive."
