    "intro": "Lepanthes embreei, commonly known as the Embree's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, white or pale pink blossoms with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
