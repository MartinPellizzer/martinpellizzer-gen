It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, waxy surface. Ligaria viscoides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions."
