    "intro": "Lupinus multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces numerous small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus multiflorus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
