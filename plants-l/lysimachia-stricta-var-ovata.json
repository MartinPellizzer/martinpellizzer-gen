It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow and clustered in loose spikes, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lysimachia stricta."
