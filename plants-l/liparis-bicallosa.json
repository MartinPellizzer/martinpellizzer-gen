    "intro": "Liparis bicallosa, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, with distinctive, spurred petals that aid in pollination by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Liparis bicallosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
