    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lespedeza virginica and Lespedeza \u00d7 tenuifolia, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, arranged in dense spikes. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Lespedeza \u00d7 oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
