It features slender, erect stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lobelia flava is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and serves as a nectar source for pollinators."
