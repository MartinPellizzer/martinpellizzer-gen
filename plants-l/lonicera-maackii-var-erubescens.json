It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are red and edible, though often consumed by birds rather than humans. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
