    "intro": "Loranthus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in pairs, giving it its scientific name. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus biflorus plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
