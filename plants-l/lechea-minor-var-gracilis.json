    "intro": "Lechea minor var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Lechea minor var. gracilis is notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
