    "intro": "Ligularia tangutorum, commonly known as the Tibetan ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountain meadows and forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
