    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. foveolata, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly depressed or sunken flower buds, a trait that sets it apart from the typical form of Linnaea borealis."
