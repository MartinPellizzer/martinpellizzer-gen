    "intro": "Lemnopsis minor, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like segments, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Lemnopsis minor is often used in aquariums and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
