    "intro": "Lobelia butaguensis, commonly known as the Butaguensis Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lobelia butaguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
