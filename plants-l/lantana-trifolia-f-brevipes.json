It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming throughout the year. The plant has hairy, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a resilient yet sometimes invasive species."
