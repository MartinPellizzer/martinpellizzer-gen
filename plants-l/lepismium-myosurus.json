    "intro": "Lepismium myosurus, commonly known as the mouse ear cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fleshy, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions. Lepismium myosurus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in rocky or sandy soils."
