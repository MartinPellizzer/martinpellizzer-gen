    "intro": "Lemurella pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered lemurella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
