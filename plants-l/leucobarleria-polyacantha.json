    "intro": "Leucobarleria polyacantha, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, which is why it is sometimes called the milk tree. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
