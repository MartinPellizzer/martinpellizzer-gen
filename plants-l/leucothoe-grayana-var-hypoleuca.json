    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the whiteleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking white to pale green leaves that contrast with its dark red stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and seasonal color changes, offering year-round interest."
