    "intro": "Lamium foetidum, commonly known as stinking nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium foetidum is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
