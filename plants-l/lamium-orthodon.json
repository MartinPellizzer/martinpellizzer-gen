It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of gardens. Lamium orthodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
