    "intro": "Lathyrus neurolobus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, producing clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Lathyrus neurolobus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various climates."
