    "intro": "Leptospermum ovalifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and for making tea. Leptospermum ovalifolium is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
