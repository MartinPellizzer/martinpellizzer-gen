    "intro": "Linaria viscosa subsp. spicata, commonly known as the sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the main species, particularly in flower structure and leaf density."
