    "intro": "Lantana crispa, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically opposite, oval, and covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
