    "intro": "Ludwigia maritima, commonly known as sea Ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its often harsh coastal environment. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. Ludwigia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
