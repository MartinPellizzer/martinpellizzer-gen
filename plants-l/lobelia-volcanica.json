    "intro": "Lobelia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and hairy, narrow leaves. This species thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic landscapes. The plant is often found in open, sunny habitats such as lava fields and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
