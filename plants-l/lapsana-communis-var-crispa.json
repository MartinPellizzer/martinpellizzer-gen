It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often curled or crisped, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
