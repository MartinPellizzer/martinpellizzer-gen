    "intro": "Lamium maculatum f. fasciatum, commonly known as the variegated dead-nettle, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and green streaks or spots on its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that suppress weeds."
