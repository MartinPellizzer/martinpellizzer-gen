    "intro": "Lespedeza juncea f. hirta, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Hairy lespedeza is often found in open woodlands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
