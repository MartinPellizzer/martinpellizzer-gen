    "intro": "Lepanthes cactoura, commonly known as the Cactus Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces vibrant, colorful flowers that are often striking in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of forests. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. Lepanthes cactoura is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
