    "intro": "Landolphia flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered African apple, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
