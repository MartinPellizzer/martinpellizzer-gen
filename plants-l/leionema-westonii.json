    "intro": "Leionema westonii, commonly known as the slender leionema, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
