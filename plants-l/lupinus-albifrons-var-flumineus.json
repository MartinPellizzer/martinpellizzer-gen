It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, pinnately compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Lupinus albifrons var. flumineus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is adapted to riparian ecosystems."
