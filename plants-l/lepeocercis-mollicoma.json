    "intro": "Lepeocercis mollicoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Lepeocercis mollicoma is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
