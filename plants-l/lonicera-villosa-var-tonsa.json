    "intro": "Lonicera villosa var. tonsa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, typically yellow or white, which give way to red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
