    "intro": "Lupinus parviflorus subsp. myrianthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
