    "intro": "Lithospermum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow lithosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Lithospermum lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in dry environments."
