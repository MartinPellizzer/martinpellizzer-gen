    "intro": "Leucophyllum laevigatum var. griseum, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, tubular pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native gardens and landscapes."
