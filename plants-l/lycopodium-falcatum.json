    "intro": "Lycopodium falcatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a tree. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodium falcatum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
