    "intro": "Lonicera sachalinensis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East, including parts of Russia and China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, usually yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
