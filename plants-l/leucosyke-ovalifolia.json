It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
