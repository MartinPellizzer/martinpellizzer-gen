    "intro": "Lepidostephium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with a distinctive structure that includes five sepals and five petals. Lepidostephium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
