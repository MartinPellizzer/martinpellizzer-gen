    "intro": "Lupinus tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus tolimensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
