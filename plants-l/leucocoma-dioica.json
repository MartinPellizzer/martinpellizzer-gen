    "intro": "Leucocoma dioica, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Leucocoma dioica is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
