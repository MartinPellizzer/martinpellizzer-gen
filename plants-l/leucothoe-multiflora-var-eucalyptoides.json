    "intro": "Leucothoe multiflora var. eucalyptoides, commonly known as the Southern waxleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that remain evergreen in mild climates but turn bronze in winter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
