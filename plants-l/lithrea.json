    "intro": "Lithrea, commonly known as the \"scented evergreen\" or \"clove tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and features aromatic leaves that emit a strong, clove-like fragrance when crushed. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Lithrea flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in inflorescences, often producing a sweet scent. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in some regions for its aromatic properties."
