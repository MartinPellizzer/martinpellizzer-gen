    "intro": "Lindsaea odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented maidenhair, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Lindsaea odorata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its fragrant spores contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
