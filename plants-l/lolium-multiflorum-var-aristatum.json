    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, coarse blades. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. However, some varieties can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of endophytic fungi."
