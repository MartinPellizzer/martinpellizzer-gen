    "intro": "Linaria pseudoviscosa, commonly known as the sticky flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Linaria pseudoviscosa is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought."
