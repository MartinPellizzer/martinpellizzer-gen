    "intro": "Liparophyllum, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow or white. Liparophyllum species are often found in rocky or coastal environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
