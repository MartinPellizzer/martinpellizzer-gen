    "intro": "Licania arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Licania arachnoidea is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its common name reflects the appearance of its hairy stems, which resemble spider silk."
