It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, yellow, and orange, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in some regions."
