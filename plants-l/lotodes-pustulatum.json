    "intro": "Lotodes pustulatum, commonly known as the spotty water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its round, floating leaves that are often dotted with small, raised spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
