    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis alpina subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra leucanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
