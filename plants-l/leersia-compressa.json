    "intro": "Leersia compressa, commonly known as flatleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat on top and rounded on the bottom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments. Leersia compressa is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
