    "intro": "Larrea wootonii, commonly known as desert parsley, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Larrea wootonii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
