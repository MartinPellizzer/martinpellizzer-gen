    "intro": "Lupinus comptus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, brown seeds. Lupinus comptus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
