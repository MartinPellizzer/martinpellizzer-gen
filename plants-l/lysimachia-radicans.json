    "intro": "Lysimachia radicans, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth texture. The plant spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
