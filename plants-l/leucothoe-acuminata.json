    "intro": "Leucothoe acuminata, commonly known as the Southern waxplant, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and turn reddish in autumn. Leucothoe acuminata thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
