    "intro": "Lamium album subsp. orientale, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grassy areas. It has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
