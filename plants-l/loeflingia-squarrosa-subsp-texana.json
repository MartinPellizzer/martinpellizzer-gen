    "intro": "Loeflingia squarrosa subsp. texana, commonly known as the Texas loeflingia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
