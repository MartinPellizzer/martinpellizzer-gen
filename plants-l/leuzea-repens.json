    "intro": "Leuzea repens, commonly known as creeping zanonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate in shape, and covered with fine, soft hairs. Leuzea repens is often found in moist, sandy soils and can thrive in shaded or partially sunny conditions."
