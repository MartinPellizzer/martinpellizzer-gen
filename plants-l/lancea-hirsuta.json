    "intro": "Lancea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy lanceflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Lancea hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
