It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in the autumn. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
