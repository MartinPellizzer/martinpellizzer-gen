    "intro": "Lycopodium passerinoides, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of ancient vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that contribute to its dense, moss-like appearance."
