    "intro": "Loeflingia caspica, commonly known as the Caspian loeflingia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
