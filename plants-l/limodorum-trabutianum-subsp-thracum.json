    "intro": "Limodorum trabutianum subsp. thracum, commonly known as the Thrace marsh lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the base. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
