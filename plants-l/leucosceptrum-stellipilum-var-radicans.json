    "intro": "Leucosceptrum stellipilum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual element to woodland gardens. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread gradually across forest floors. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks."
