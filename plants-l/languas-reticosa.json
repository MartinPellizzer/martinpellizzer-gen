It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, reticulate venation pattern on its leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Languas reticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
