    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 holmbergii, commonly known as hybrid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a combination of traits from both Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Lolium multiflorum (annual ryegrass). It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage, which makes it highly desirable for forage and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered in groups of three. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly used in agricultural settings due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment. However, its aggressive growth can sometimes lead to competition with other grasses in mixed pastures."
