    "intro": "Litobrochia elata, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-white with a distinctive yellow lip. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. Litobrochia elata is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
