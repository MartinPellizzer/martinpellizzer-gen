    "intro": "Laportea densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower false mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Laportea densiflora is often found in woodland edges and wetlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
