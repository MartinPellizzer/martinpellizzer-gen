    "intro": "Lactuca graminifolia var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican lettuce, is a perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose spikes, and it is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional cuisine, particularly in Mexican cooking, and it has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties. The species is closely related to other lettuce species but is distinguished by its unique morphological features and geographic distribution."
