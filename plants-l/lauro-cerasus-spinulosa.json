    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly cherry or spiny cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, dark purple leaves and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its thorned stems can make handling the plant challenging."
