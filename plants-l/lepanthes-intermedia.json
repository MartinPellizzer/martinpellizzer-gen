    "intro": "Lepanthes intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often have a slipper-like shape, which is a defining feature of the Lepanthes genus. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or greenish, are often fragrant and attract various pollinators like bees and moths."
