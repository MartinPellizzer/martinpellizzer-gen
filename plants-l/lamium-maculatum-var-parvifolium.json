    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the spotted deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red, purple, or brown markings, and small, two-lipped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, violet, or white. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or as a ground cover. It has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread easily, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive in some regions. Lamium maculatum var. parvifolium is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
