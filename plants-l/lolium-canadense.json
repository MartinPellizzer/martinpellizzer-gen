    "intro": "Lolium canadense, commonly known as Canadian bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, which distinguishes it from other grass species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Lolium canadense is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
