    "intro": "Lycopodium echinatum, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium echinatum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
