    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan lily, is a rare and ornamental species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bulbous roots and has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens with adequate space. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
