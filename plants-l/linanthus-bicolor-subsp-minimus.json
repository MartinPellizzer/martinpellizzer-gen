    "intro": "Linanthus bicolor subsp. minimus, commonly known as the small-flowered flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to white flowers. The subspecies minimus is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter stature compared to the typical form of L. bicolor. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native environment."
