    "intro": "Lepidosperma angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mat-rush, is a species of sedge native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seed capsules. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
