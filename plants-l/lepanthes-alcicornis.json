    "intro": "Lepanthes alcicornis, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its natural habitat. Lepanthes alcicornis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
