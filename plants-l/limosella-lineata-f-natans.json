    "intro": "Limosella lineata f. natans, commonly known as floating sandspurry, is a herbaceous annual plant that thrives in wet or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy or sandy substrates, allowing it to survive in fluctuating water levels. This variety is often found in marshes, ditches, and other wetland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
