    "intro": "Lomaria procera var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp lomaria, is a variant of the lomaria plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. This plant is typically found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
