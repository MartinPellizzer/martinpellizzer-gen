    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 armata var. velutina, commonly known as velvet lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
