    "intro": "Luzula nivea subvar. rubella, commonly known as the pink tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often bear clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more reddish at the base in some varieties. The subvariety rubella is distinguished by its distinctive pinkish coloration, particularly in the inflorescence, which adds to its ornamental value."
