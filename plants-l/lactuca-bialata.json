It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lactuca bialata is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
