    "intro": "Lotus macedonicus, commonly known as the Macedonian lotus, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils near streams and rivers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local medicine."
