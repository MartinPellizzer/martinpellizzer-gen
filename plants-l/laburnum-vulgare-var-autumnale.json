    "intro": "Laburnum vulgare var. autumnale, commonly known as the autumnal laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, with slender, pointed leaflets that turn a striking coppery red in the autumn. This variety is notable for its extended flowering period compared to the common laburnum, often blooming into early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
