    "intro": "Leucothoe eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features attractive, elliptical leaves that are typically a silvery-gray color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
