It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
