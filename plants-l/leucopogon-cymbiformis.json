    "intro": "Leucopogon cymbiformis, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, thriving in the cool, moist environments of heathlands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and flat, distinguishing it from other species in the Leucopogon genus. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for various pollinators."
