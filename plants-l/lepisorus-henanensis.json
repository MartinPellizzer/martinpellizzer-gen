    "intro": "Lepisorus henanensis, commonly known as the Henan spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leafy body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense. Its spores are produced in capsules that are borne on stalks, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Lepisorus henanensis is often found in humid regions of China, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
