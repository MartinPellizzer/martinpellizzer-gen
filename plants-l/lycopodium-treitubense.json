    "intro": "Lycopodium treitubense, commonly known as the treitubense clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium treitubense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
