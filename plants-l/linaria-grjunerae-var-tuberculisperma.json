    "intro": "Linaria grjunerae var. tuberculisperma, commonly known as the tuberculate toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Linaria grjunerae var. tuberculisperma is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
