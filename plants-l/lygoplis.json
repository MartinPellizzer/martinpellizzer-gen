    "intro": "Lygoplis, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The seed pods mature to a yellowish-green color and split open to release the seeds. Due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution, Lygoplis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
