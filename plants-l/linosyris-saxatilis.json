    "intro": "Linosyris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Linosyris saxatilis is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
