    "intro": "Leucas hirta var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping leucas, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy or rocky habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for ground cover."
