    "intro": "Lomandra integra, commonly known as the common lomandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and robust rhizomatous growth. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in summer, followed by dark blue or black berries. Lomandra integra is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
