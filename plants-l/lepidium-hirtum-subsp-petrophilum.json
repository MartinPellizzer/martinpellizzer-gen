    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum subsp. petrophilum, commonly known as the rock pepper or mountain pepper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its hairy, glandular leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant typically grows in limestone or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fruits are small, dry pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
