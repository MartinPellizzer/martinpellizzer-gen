    "intro": "Lindera caudata, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that mature in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lindera caudata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
