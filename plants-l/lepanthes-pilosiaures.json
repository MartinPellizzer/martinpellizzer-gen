    "intro": "Lepanthes pilosiaures, commonly known as the hairy-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Lepanthes pilosiaures is a popular choice for shade gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
