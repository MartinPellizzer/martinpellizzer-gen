    "intro": "Lunathyrium wilsonii var. muliense, commonly known as the Muli lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
