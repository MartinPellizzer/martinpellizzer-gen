    "intro": "Lupinus bridgesii, commonly known as the bridges lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. Lupinus bridgesii is part of the legume family, which means it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species."
