It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its dense growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
