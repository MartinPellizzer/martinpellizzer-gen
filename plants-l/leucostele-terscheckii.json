It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include alternate, ovate leaves and a distinct, branched stem.
