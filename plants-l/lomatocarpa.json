    "intro": "Lomatocarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and drought. Lomatocarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
