    "intro": "Lyonia ovalifolia var. rubrovenia, commonly known as the red-veined lyonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
