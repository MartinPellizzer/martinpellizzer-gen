    "intro": "Leandriella valvata, commonly known as the valvate leandriella, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Leandriella valvata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
