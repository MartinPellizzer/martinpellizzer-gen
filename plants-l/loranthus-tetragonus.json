    "intro": "Loranthus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has a distinctive four-angled stem and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on a variety of host trees."
