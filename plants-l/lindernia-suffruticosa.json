It features upright, branching stems covered in silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
