    "intro": "Lobaria, commonly known as the \"liverworts,\" is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, lobed thallus, which is typically attached to rocks or trees through a basal holdfast. Lobaria species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or cliff faces. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them valuable indicators of environmental conditions."
