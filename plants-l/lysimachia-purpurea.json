    "intro": "Lysimachia purpurea, commonly known as purple moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Lysimachia purpurea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
