    "intro": "Ligusticum talassicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and distinctive, spiky leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ligusticum talassicum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
