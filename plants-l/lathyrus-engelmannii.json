    "intro": "Lathyrus engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus engelmannii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
