    "intro": "Lachemilla tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted mossy willow, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters of three, which is reflected in its scientific name. Lachemilla tripartita is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
