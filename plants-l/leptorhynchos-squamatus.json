    "intro": "Leptorhynchos squamatus, commonly known as the squamated leathery fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, scaly fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
