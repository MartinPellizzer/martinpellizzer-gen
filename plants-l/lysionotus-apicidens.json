    "intro": "Lysionotus apicidens, commonly known as the apical-angled lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a tightly adherent layer on rocks or bark. The plant exhibits a pale to yellowish-green coloration, with a distinctive apical angle that gives it its common name. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments across temperate regions. Lysionotus apicidens plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
