    "intro": "Leptotes bicolor subsp. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leucaena, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and divided into small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. The subspecies is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet."
