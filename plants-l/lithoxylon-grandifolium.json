    "intro": "Lithoxylon grandifolium, commonly known as the grandifoliate lithoxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by hard, woody fruits containing seeds. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable subject for botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
