    "intro": "Loranthus caudatifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. The berries it forms are usually red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
