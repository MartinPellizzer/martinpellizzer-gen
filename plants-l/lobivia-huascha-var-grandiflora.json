It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to grayish spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
