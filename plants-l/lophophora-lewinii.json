    "intro": "Lophophora lewinii, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is known for containing the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline. Lophophora lewinii is often cultivated for its unique appearance and cultural significance, though it is protected in many regions due to its legal status and ecological importance."
