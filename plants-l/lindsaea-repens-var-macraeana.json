It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. Its spores are borne on the underside of the leaves in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops."
