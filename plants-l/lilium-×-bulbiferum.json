    "intro": "Lilium \u00d7 bulbiferum, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a hybrid bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a cluster of small, cup-shaped blooms atop a tall stem. The plant produces large, fragrant blossoms in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year in suitable growing conditions. The Turk's cap lily is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
