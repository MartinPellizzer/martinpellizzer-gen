    "intro": "Loxanthocereus pullatus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink. These flowers have a strong fragrance and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Loxanthocereus pullatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
