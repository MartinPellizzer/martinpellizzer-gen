    "intro": "Ludwigia microcarpa, commonly known as dwarf Ludwigia, is a compact aquatic plant native to South America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically bright green, with a slight reddish tinge under bright light. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, making it less showy than other Ludwigia species. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is popular in planted aquariums for its ease of care and aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense, lush growth in freshwater environments."
