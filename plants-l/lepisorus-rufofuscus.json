    "intro": "Lepisorus rufofuscus, commonly known as the red-brown wood moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, reddish-brown rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, waxy surface and a distinct midrib. Lepisorus rufofuscus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
