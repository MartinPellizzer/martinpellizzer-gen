    "intro": "Liabum ovatum var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy ovate liabum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features slender, upright stems that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are ovate in shape, with a pointed tip and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
