    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus subsp. velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit lathyris, is a flowering plant native to the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces slender, upright stems with palmately divided leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in open woodland or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
