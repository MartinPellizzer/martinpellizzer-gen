    "intro": "Lycium lancifolium, commonly known as Chinese wolfberry or goji berry, is a shrub native to China, Mongolia, and Russia. It is characterized by its spiny stems, small yellow flowers, and red berries that turn orange-red when mature. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought resistance. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
