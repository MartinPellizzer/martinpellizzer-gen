    "intro": "Linum austriacum subsp. austriacum, commonly known as Austrian flax, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its fibrous stems are historically used for textile production, similar to common flax."
