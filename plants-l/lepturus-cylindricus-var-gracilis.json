    "intro": "Lepturus cylindricus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender false heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically a deep green color, arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and hardiness."
