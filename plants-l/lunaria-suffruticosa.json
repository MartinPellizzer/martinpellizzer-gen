    "intro": "Lunaria suffruticosa, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, white or pale blue flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that split open to release tiny, lens-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Lunaria suffruticosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
