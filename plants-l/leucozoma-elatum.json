    "intro": "Leucozoma elatum, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive white or pale gray upper surface and a darker, more leathery lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
