    "intro": "Lindsaea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid and shaded conditions of the tropical canopy. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself securely to its host. Lindsaea borneensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
