    "intro": "Lysimachia carpenteri, commonly known as Carpenter's mossyrtle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It produces yellowish-green to white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
