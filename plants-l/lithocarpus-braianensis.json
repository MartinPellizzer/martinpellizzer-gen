    "intro": "Lithocarpus braianensis, commonly known as the Bornean stone\u680e, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, leathery shell, similar to other members of its genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and botanical research."
