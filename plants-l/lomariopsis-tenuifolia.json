    "intro": "Lomariopsis tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically slender and finely divided. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in humid forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. Lomariopsis tenuifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
