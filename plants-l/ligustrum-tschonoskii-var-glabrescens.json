It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
