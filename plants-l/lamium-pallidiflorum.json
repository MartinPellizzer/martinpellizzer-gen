It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
