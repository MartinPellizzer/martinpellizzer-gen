    "intro": "Lycium ignarum, commonly known as the desert\u67b8\u675e, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, red berries that resemble those of the common wolfberry. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces fruit that is both edible and used in traditional medicine. Lycium ignarum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for wildlife."
