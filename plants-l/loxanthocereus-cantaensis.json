    "intro": "Loxanthocereus cantaensis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Loxanthocereus cantaensis is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water needs and striking floral display."
