    "intro": "Lagothamnus microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf lavender or rock lavender, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
