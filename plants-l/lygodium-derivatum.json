    "intro": "Lygodium derivatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, wiry stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Lygodium derivatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
