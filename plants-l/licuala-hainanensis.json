    "intro": "Licuala hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing after the leaves have matured. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
