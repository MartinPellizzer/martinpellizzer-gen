    "intro": "Lycianthes parasitica var. praelongipedicellata, commonly known as the long-fruited false huito, is a parasitic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that attach to host plants for nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals. The fruit is fleshy and contains several seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
