    "intro": "Lobelia philippinensis subsp. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments like montane forests and stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
