    "intro": "Ligularia palmata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often glossy and can reach up to 12 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Ligularia palmata is well-suited for wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
