    "intro": "Lespedeza ichangensis, commonly known as the Chinese lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza ichangensis is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
