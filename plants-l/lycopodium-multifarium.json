    "intro": "Lycopodium multifarium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones. It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. Lycopodium multifarium reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle. This plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
