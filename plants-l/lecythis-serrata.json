It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowers are yellow and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. The plant plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest and is also economically significant due to its valuable nuts."
