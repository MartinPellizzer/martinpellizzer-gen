    "intro": "Liabum hypochlorum, commonly known as the paleleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features basal leaves that are typically pale green with a waxy coating, and its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a single head. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
