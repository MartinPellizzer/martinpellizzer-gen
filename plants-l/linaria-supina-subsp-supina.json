    "intro": "Linaria supina subsp. supina, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, producing clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapting to arid and rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
