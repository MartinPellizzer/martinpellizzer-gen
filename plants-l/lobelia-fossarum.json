    "intro": "Lobelia fossarum, commonly known as the fen lobelia, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils found in bogs and fens. The plant features slender stems and whorled leaves, with small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. It is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its specialized environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
