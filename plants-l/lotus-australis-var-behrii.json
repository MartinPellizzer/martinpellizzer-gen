    "intro": "Lotus australis var. behrii, commonly known as the Behri's lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Australia. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
