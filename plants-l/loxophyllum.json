    "intro": "Loxophyllum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, these plants are adapted to hot, dry climates. They typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in coastal areas. Loxophyllum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
