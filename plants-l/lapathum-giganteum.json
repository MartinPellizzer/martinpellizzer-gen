    "intro": "Lapathum giganteum, commonly known as giant betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with toothed margins, and the plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Lapathum giganteum is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
