    "intro": "Leucochrysum albicans subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its fibrous roots and compact growth form help it survive in high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients and strong winds."
