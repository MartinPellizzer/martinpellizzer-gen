    "intro": "Limonium ramosissimum subsp. doerfleri, commonly known as the Desert Forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
