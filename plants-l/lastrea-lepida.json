It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
