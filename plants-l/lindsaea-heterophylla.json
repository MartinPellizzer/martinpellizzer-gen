    "intro": "Lindsaea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern or the heterophyllous lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being strap-shaped and others more rounded. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots. Lindsaea heterophylla exhibits a unique form of heterophylly, where the same plant produces different leaf shapes depending on environmental conditions. This adaptability makes it an interesting subject for studying plant responses to light and moisture availability."
