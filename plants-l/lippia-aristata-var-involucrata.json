    "intro": "Lippia aristata var. involucrata, commonly known as silverleaf lippia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
