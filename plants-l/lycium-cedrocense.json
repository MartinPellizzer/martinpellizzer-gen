    "intro": "Lycium cedrocense, commonly known as the Cedros nightshade, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red or orange berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Lycium cedrocense is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
