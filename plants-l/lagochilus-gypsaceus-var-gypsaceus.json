    "intro": "Lagochilus gypsaceus var. gypsaceus, commonly known as the desert bugloss, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and minimal water requirements."
