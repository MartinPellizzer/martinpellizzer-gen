    "intro": "Lecanorchis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lecanorchis triloba is often found in association with other orchid species and is considered an indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
