    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the islands of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its wood is lightweight and is occasionally used for construction and furniture."
