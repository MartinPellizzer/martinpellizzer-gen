    "intro": "Lythrum anomalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its showy, pink to purple flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, attracting various pollinators. Lythrum anomalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
