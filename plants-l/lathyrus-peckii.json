    "intro": "Lathyrus peckii, commonly known as the Peck's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lathyrus peckii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its seed pods contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across its native range."
