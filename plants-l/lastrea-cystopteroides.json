    "intro": "Lastrea cystopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
