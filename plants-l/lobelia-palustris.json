    "intro": "Lobelia palustris, commonly known as swamp lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Lobelia palustris thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
