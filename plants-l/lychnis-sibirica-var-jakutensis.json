It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant features erect stems that are often hairy, with simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are showy, with five pink or red petals that bloom in early summer. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
