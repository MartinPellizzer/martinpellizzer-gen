    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. eremanthus, commonly known as the yellow bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive leaflets that resemble a bird's foot. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
