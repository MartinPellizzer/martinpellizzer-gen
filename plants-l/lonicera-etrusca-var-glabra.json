It features opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and often have a reddish underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, typically yellow or orange, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to various garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which attract pollinators and birds."
