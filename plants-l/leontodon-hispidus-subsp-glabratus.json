    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus subsp. glabratus, commonly known as the hairy hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a robust root system and a stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The subspecies glabratus is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to the typical hairy form of the species."
