    "intro": "Lasianthus fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fan Mountain lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
