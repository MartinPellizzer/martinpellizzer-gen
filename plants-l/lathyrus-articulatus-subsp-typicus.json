    "intro": "Lathyrus articulatus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are pea-shaped, usually purple or pink, and appear in clusters along the stems. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
