    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea var. submontana, commonly known as the mountain lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the leaf margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for montane ecosystems and its contribution to biodiversity in tropical rainforests."
