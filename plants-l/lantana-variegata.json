    "intro": "Lantana variegata, commonly known as the variegated lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy texture and often display variegation in white, yellow, or cream patterns. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
