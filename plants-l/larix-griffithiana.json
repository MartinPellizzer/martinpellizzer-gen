    "intro": "Larix griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's larch, is a species of larch native to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the autumn. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions at high altitudes, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
