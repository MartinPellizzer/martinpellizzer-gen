    "intro": "Lycium apiculatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features woody stems with sharp, spine-like thorns and elliptical, leathery leaves that are longer and narrower than those of the typical Lycium apiculatum. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal stabilization projects."
