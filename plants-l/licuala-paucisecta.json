It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found near mangrove forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
