    "intro": "Leucanthemum paludosum, commonly known as swamp sandwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features basal leaves that are typically oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or peaty soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
