    "intro": "Lamourouxia rhinanthifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils in grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
