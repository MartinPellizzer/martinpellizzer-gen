    "intro": "Lecanorchis thalassica var. laoensis, commonly known as the Lao sea orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Laos. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns resembling sea waves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid and cool environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
