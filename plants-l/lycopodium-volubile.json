    "intro": "Lycopodium volubile, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium volubile plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
