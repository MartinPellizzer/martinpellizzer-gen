    "intro": "Laburnum anagyroides f. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved goldenchain, is a cultivar of the laburnum plant characterized by its distinctive, broad, oak-like leaves. It is a deciduous shrub that produces long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The leaves are typically larger and more coarsely toothed compared to the typical species, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This cultivar is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
