    "intro": "Lithocarpus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. It is a medium to large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and robust, woody structure. The plant produces hard, nut-like fruits that are enclosed in a thick, persistent cupule, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
