    "intro": "Lepanthes cissyana, commonly known as the Cissy's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lepanthes cissyana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
