    "intro": "Lonicera interrupta var. subspicata, commonly known as the redflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it is known for its fragrant nectar. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative means."
