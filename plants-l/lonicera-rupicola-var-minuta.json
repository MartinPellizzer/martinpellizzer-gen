    "intro": "Lonicera rupicola var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in shades of yellow and white. The plant has slender, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb if supported. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low growth habit and drought tolerance."
