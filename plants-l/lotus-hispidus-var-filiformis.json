    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. filiformis, commonly known as the silky lotus, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots are adapted to filter nutrients from the water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
