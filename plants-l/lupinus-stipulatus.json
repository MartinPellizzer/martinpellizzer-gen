    "intro": "Lupinus stipulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, stipular structures at the base of each leaflet, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Lupinus stipulatus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
