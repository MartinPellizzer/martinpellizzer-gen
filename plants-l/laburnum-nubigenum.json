    "intro": "Laburnum nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-like laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Laburnum nubigenum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
