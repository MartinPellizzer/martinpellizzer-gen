    "intro": "Lankesteriana cuspidata, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its tall, erect stems that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces numerous showy inflorescences with narrow, pointed petals and sepals, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments with high light exposure and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts who appreciate its unique beauty."
