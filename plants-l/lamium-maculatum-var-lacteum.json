    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. lacteum, commonly known as the white nettle or milkweed plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white variegated leaves with a faintly milky sap, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
