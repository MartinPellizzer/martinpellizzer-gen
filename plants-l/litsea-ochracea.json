    "intro": "Litsea ochracea, commonly known as the yellow litsea, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are yellow when mature. Litsea ochracea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It also has a history of use in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
