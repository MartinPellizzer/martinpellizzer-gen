    "intro": "Lachnostoma tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a distinctive pattern of dark, tiger-like markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on bark, stone, or wood in temperate regions. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria, which together carry out photosynthesis. Its structure provides a protective layer against environmental stressors, allowing it to survive in challenging conditions. This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
