    "intro": "Lepisorus morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it is often found in montane or subalpine regions. Lepisorus morrisonensis is notable for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
