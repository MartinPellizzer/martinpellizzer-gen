    "intro": "Lasiochlamys peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Lasiochlamys peltata is adapted to thrive in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
