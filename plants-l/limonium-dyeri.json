    "intro": "Limonium dyeri, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tightly packed florets. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Limonium dyeri is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to maritime climates."
