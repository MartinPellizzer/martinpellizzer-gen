    "intro": "Leptogramma decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the spreading leathery fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features elongated, leathery leaves that are often described as having a decurrent and alate appearance, meaning they extend downward and have a wing-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
