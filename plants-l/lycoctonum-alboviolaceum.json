    "intro": "Lycoctonum alboviolaceum, commonly known as the white and violet lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, pale pink to white petals with a subtle violet hue. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
