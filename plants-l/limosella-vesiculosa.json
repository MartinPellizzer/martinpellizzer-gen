    "intro": "Limosella vesiculosa, commonly known as bladderleaf sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Limosella vesiculosa is a member of the Montiaceae family and is adapted to harsh, saline conditions."
