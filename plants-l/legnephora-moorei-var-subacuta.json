    "intro": "Legnephora moorei var. subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved legnephora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are characterized by their acute tips and slightly serrated margins, contributing to its distinct appearance. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
