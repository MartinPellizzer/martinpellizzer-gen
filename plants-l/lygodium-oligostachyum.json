    "intro": "Lygodium oligostachyum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a member of the family Lygodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a climbing fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically clustered in clusters called strobili. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
