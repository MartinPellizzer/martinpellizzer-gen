    "intro": "Lonchitis anthriscifolia, commonly known as the fern brake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are clustered in a specific pattern. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
