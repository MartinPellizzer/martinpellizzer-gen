    "intro": "Lesquerella arctica subsp. calderi, commonly known as the Arctic lesquerella, is a rare plant species native to the high Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland. It is a low-growing, mat-forming herb that thrives in extremely cold and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its seeds contain a unique type of oil, which has been studied for potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
