    "intro": "Lepidagathis radicalis, commonly known as the creeping lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, opposite leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Lepidagathis radicalis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
