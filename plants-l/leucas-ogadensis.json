    "intro": "Leucas ogadensis, commonly known as the African blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Leucas ogadensis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
