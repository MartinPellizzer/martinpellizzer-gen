    "intro": "Lilaeopsis carolinensis var. attenuata, commonly known as the Carolina grass. It is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
