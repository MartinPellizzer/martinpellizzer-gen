    "intro": "Leptorkis minima, commonly known as the small-leaved leptorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
