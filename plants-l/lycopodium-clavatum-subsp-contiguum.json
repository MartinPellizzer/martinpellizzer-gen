    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum subsp. contiguum, commonly known as the club moss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing strobila, which are clustered in cones. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit with scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
