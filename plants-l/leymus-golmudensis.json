    "intro": "Leymus golmudensis, commonly known as the Golmud grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, arid conditions and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Leymus golmudensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Its seeds are also an important food source for local wildlife."
