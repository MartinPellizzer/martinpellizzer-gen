    "intro": "Loasa heucherifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf loasa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Loasa heucherifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage and flowering structure make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
