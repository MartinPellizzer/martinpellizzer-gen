    "intro": "Leptorkis rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive bracts that resemble dandelion seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Leptorkis rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
