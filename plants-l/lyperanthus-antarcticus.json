It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Lyperanthus antarcticus is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
