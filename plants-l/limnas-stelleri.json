    "intro": "Limnas stelleri, commonly known as the Steller's waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Limnas stelleri thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
