    "intro": "Lupinus edwin-livingstonii, commonly known as Edwin Livingston's lupin, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
