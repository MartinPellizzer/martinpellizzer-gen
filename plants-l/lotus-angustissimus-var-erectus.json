    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. erectus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, sturdy petioles. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy bottoms of ponds and lakes. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in water gardens."
