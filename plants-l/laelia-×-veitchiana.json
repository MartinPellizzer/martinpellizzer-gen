    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with multiple flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. Laelia \u00d7 veitchiana is prized by orchid growers for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
