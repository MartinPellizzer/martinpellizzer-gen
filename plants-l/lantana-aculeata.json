    "intro": "Lantana aculeata, commonly known as the shrub lantana, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange to red, depending on the variety. Lantana aculeata is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to drought. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
