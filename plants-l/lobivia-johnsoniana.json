    "intro": "Lobivia johnsoniana, commonly known as the Johnson's lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
