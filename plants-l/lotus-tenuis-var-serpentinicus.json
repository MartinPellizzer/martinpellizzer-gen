    "intro": "Lotus tenuis var. serpentinicus, commonly known as the serpentine lotus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are nutrient-poor and often toxic. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in southern France and northern Italy. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in harsh, alkaline conditions that are inhospitable to most other plant species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
