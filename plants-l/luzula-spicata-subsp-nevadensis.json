    "intro": "Luzula spicata subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Luzula spicata subsp. nevadensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its high-altitude environment and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions."
