    "intro": "Lepidamphora, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Lepidamphora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
