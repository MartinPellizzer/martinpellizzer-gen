    "intro": "Lepidium calycinum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is distinguished from other lepidium species by its smooth, unlobed foliage and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
