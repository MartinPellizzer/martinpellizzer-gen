    "intro": "Lasianthera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan lasianthera, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive red calyx. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Lasianthera papuana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in the region."
