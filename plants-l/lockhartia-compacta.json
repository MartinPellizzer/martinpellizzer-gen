    "intro": "Lockhartia compacta, commonly known as the compact orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows from a rhizome and has strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom during the rainy season, making it a popular choice for humid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
