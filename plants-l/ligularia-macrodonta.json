    "intro": "Ligularia macrodonta, commonly known as the giant ligularia, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic foliage plant."
