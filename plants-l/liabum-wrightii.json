    "intro": "Liabum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Liabum wrightii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
