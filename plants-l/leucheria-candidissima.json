    "intro": "Leucheria candidissima, commonly known as the white leucheria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
