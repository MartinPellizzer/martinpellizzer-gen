    "intro": "Leptonychia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a cluster, blooming in early summer."
