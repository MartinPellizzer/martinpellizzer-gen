    "intro": "Lerchia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to various regions of Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plants typically have upright stems and produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. Lerchia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. They are also valued for their ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
