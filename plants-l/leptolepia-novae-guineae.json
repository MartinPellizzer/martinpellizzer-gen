    "intro": "Leptolepia novae-guineae, commonly known as the New Guinea leptolepia, is a fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
