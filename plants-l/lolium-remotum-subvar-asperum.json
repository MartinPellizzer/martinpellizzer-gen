    "intro": "Lolium remotum subvar. asperum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, with small, awned lemmas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in forage and erosion control."
