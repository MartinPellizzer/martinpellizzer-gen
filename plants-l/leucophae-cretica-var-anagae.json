    "intro": "Leucophae cretica var. anagae, commonly known as the Anagae leucophoe, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
