    "intro": "Lyonia multiflora, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are dark blue to black in color, often used in local culinary traditions. Lyonia multiflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and salt spray. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing dune ecosystems."
