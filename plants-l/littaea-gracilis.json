    "intro": "Littaea gracilis, commonly known as the slender lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Littaea gracilis plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to wetland ecosystems."
