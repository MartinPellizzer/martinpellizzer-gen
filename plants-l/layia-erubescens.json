    "intro": "Layia erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Layia erubescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
