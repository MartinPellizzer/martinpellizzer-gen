    "intro": "Lotus utahensis, commonly known as the Utah lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and along the edges of lakes and rivers, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help it survive in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The Utah lotus plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
