    "intro": "Lastrea limbosperma, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though often used as forage for wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
