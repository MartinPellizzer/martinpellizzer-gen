    "intro": "Linaria hederifolia, commonly known as the trailing arnoldia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Linaria hederifolia is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
