    "intro": "Linaria tristis var. pruinosa, commonly known as the silverweed or pruinose toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating called pruina, which gives it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Linaria tristis var. pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
