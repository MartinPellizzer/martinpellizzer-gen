    "intro": "Lolium elongatum, commonly known as elongated ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Lolium elongatum is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
