    "intro": "Larnax lutea, commonly known as the yellow larnax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Larnax lutea typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
