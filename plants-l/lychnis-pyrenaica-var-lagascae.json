    "intro": "Lychnis pyrenaica var. lagascae, commonly known as the Pyrenean campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial with upright stems and small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to the typical Lychnis pyrenaica."
