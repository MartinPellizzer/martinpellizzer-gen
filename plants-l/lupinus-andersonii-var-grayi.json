    "intro": "Lupinus andersonii var. grayi, commonly known as the Gray's lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its root system consists of nodules formed through a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Lupinus andersonii var. grayi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
