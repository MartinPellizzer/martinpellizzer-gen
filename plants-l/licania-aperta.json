It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Licania aperta is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and secondary growth areas."
