    "intro": "Lepisorus tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy kidney fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, orbicular spore-bearing leaves. Lepisorus tricholepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
