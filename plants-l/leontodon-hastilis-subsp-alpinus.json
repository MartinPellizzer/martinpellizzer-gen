    "intro": "Leontodon hastilis subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes."
