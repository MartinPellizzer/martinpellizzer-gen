    "intro": "Licania velata, commonly known as the silverleaf licania, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, cream-colored flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Licania velata is typically found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests in Central and South America."
