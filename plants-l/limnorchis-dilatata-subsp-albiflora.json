    "intro": "Limnorchis dilatata subsp. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered water orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are linear and often occur in dense rosettes near the base of the plant. The species is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in areas with standing or flowing water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
