    "intro": "Larix griffithii subsp. kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo larch, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Himalayan regions of China and India. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cones, typical of the genus Larix. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
