It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of bright red or pink flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Lupinus amabilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, which benefits soil fertility."
