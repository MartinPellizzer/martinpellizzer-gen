    "intro": "Laburnum anagyroides f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its cascading golden-yellow flowers. It is a cultivar of the laburnum tree, known for its distinctive, drooping branches that create a dramatic, flowing appearance. The plant features pinnate leaves and produces long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow blooms in early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and planted away from areas where children or pets may access it."
