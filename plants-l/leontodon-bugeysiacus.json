    "intro": "Leontodon bugeysiacus, commonly known as the Bugey leontodon, is a flowering plant native to the limestone regions of southeastern France. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white ray florets, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity."
