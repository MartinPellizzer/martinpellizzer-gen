    "intro": "Larnax pedrazae, commonly known as the Pedraza rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Larnax pedrazae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
