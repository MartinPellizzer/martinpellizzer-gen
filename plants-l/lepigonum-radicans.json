    "intro": "Lepigonum radicans, commonly known as spreading bugloss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across rocky or gravelly ground. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often tinged with a bluish hue. Lepigonum radicans is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
