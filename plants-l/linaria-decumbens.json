    "intro": "Linaria decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, often arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Linaria decumbens is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of dry, open habitats."
