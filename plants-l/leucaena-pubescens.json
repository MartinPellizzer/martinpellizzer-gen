    "intro": "Leucaena pubescens, commonly known as silky leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Leucaena pubescens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
