    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. mannii, commonly known as the meadow false forget-me-not, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
