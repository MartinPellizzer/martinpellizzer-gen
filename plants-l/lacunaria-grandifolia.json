It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
