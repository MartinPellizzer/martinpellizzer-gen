    "intro": "Lespedeza latebrosa, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in sunny, dry habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Lespedeza latebrosa is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
