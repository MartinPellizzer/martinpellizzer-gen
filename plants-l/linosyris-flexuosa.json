It is a member of the Leguminosae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often grow along the ground, forming dense mats. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.
