It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomes and dense, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense mats on limestone or granite surfaces. Its fronds are usually dark green, with a rough, textured surface, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.
