    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in pairs on slender stems. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical Linnaea borealis, making it a unique and delicate member of the Geraniaceae family."
