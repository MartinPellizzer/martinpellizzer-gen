    "intro": "Luzula papuana, commonly known as the Papuan woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually greenish or brownish in color, typical of many sedges. Luzula papuana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous or alpine regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
