    "intro": "Lupinus menziesii f. brunneosulphureus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other lupine species. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
