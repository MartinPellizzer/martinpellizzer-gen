    "intro": "Lemna valdiviana var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with each frond producing numerous daughter plants that detach and float away. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can play a role in water filtration and serve as a food source for aquatic organisms."
