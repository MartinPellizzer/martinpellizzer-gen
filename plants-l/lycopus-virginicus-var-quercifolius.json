It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a velvety texture. Small white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during early summer, followed by red berries that persist into the fall.
