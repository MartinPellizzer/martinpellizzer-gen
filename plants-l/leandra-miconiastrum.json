    "intro": "Leandra miconiastrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the wet season. It is native to Central and South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
