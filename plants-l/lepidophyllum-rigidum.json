    "intro": "Lepidophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid lepidophyllum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, waxy cuticle and succulent stems that store water. Lepidophyllum rigidum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
