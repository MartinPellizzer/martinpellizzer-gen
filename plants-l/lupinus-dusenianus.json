    "intro": "Lupinus dusenianus, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely branched structure. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus dusenianus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
