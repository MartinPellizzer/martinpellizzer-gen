    "intro": "Lycopodioides miniatospora, commonly known as the miniature spore lycopod, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves and a root system that anchors it to rocky or soil substrates. The plant produces microspores and megaspores in separate cones, a feature typical of many ancient plant groups. Its sporophyte generation is dominant, with the gametophyte stage being short-lived and often overlooked. Lycopodioides miniatospora is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists studying the evolution of early land plants."
