    "intro": "Lobelia altimontis, commonly known as the highland lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and has a specialized root system for absorbing moisture from the thin mountain air. Lobelia altimontis plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
