    "intro": "Laelia albida var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-tinged orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white petals, which often have a subtle sulfur-yellow hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are relatively small but numerous, forming dense clusters that bloom in late winter or early spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging species to cultivate."
