    "intro": "Lupinus oscarii, commonly known as the Oscarii lupin, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus oscarii is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
