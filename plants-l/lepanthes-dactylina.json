    "intro": "Lepanthes dactylina, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Lepanthes dactylina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
