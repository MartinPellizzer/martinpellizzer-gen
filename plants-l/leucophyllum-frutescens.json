    "intro": "Leucophyllum frutescens, commonly known as Texas betony, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
