    "intro": "Lonicera maackii var. typica, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers that turn orange-red as they mature. It is often found in moist, woodland areas and can spread aggressively through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
