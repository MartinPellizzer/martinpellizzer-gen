    "intro": "Laserpitium mutellinoides, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is noted for its hardy nature and is often found in regions with poor soil conditions."
