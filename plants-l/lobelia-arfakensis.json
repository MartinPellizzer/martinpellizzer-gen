    "intro": "Lobelia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfaken lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lobelia arfakensis is considered a vulnerable species."
