    "intro": "Lilium habaense, commonly known as the Haba lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces sword-shaped leaves and is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its alpine environment and its role in local ecosystems. The Haba lily is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
