It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, slender stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila. This variety is characterized by its elongated stems and is often found in humid, temperate regions."
