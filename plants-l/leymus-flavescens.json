    "intro": "Leymus flavescens, commonly known as yellow false brome, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are usually a pale green to yellowish color. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or brown, and it flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along streambanks. Leymus flavescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
