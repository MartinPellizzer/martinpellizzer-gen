It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round pods containing seeds that are often used for forage or ornamental purposes. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable plant in arid landscapes. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability contribute to its ecological and agricultural importance."
