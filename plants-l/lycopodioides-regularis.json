    "intro": "Lycopodioides regularis, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, upright, branched stem. The plant produces spores in sporangia that are clustered in strobila, which are cone-like structures at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides regularis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a primitive vascular plant with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
