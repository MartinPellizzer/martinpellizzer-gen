    "intro": "Lepidium lasiocarpum, commonly known as the roughpod wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant features small, yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its fruit is a distinctive, rough, club-shaped silique that splits open to release seeds. Lepidium lasiocarpum is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
