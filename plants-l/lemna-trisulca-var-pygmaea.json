    "intro": "Lemna trisulca var. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and its reproductive structures are adapted for water propagation. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The species is notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense mats on the water surface."
