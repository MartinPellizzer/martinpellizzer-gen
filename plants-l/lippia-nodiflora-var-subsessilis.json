    "intro": "Lippia nodiflora var. subsessilis, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. The subsessilis variety is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Lippia nodiflora."
