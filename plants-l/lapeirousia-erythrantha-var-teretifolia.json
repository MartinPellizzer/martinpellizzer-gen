    "intro": "Lapeirousia erythrantha var. teretifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered bulbous orchid, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stem with several flowers clustered at the top. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of the Western Cape. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
