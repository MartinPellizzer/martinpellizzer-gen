It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows, and it thrives in partial to full shade. Its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is often found in association with other woodland flora. It is a relatively small herbaceous perennial with a clump-forming habit and fine, grass-like leaves."
