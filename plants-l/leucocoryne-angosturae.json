    "intro": "Leucocoryne angosturae, commonly known as the Angostura lily, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white flowers and strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that support its growth and flowering cycle. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
