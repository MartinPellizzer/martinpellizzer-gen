    "intro": "Lepisorus platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-snouted polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Lepisorus platyrhynchos is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
