    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 floridana, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red, depending on the variety. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
