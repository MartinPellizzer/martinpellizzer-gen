    "intro": "Lannea lagdoensis, commonly known as the Lagdo lannea, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, red or orange fruits. Lannea lagdoensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its potential for medicinal use."
