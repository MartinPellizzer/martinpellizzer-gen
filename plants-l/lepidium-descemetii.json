    "intro": "Lepidium descemetii, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb with smooth, glabrous stems and alternate, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Lepidium descemetii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showcasing resilience through deep root systems and drought tolerance."
