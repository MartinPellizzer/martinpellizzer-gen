    "intro": "Lycopus lucidus var. americanus, commonly known as American waterweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
