It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Liparis ridleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
