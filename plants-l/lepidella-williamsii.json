    "intro": "Lepidella williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' flax lily, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Lepidella williamsii is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
