    "intro": "Ledum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers contain toxic compounds, including aromatic oils and phenolic substances. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic ecosystems."
