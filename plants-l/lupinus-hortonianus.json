    "intro": "Lupinus hortonianus, commonly known as the Horton's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus hortonianus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
