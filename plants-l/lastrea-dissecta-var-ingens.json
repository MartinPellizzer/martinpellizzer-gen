    "intro": "Lastrea dissecta var. ingens, commonly known as the giant dissected lastrea, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
