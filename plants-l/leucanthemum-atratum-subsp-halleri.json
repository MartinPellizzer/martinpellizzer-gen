    "intro": "Leucanthemum atratum subsp. halleri, commonly known as the Haller's glover's cross, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark violet to nearly black petals, which contrast with its white center, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
