    "intro": "Lechea exserta, commonly known as the slender lechea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Lechea exserta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic research."
