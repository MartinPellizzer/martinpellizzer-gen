    "intro": "Laccosperma robustum, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species."
