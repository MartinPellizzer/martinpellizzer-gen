    "intro": "Liatris cymosa, commonly known as the pink gayfeather, is a native North American flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Liatris cymosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
