    "intro": "Lespedeza splendens, commonly known as flame violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza splendens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and support pollinators."
