    "intro": "Lemna parodiana, commonly known as the water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like structure of tiny, overlapping leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has no true stems or roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually via vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable. Lemna parodiana is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
