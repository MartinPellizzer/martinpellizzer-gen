    "intro": "Lotus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate water lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes. Lotus prostratus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
