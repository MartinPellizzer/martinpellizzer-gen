It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white flowers with a pleasant, sweet fragrance. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth, grass-like texture. Lilium album is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The bulbs of this plant are edible when young and are sometimes used in cooking."
