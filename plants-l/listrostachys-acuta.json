    "intro": "Listrostachys acuta, commonly known as the sharp-stemmed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, raceme-like clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
