    "intro": "Lomariopsis kingii, commonly known as the King's lomariopsis, is a rare and endangered fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its fronds, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
