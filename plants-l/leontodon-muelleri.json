    "intro": "Leontodon muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Leontodon muelleri is relatively drought-tolerant and is considered a hardy species adapted to the arid conditions of its native range."
