    "intro": "Leuconotis subavenis var. elastica, commonly known as the rubberleaf plant, is a unique variant of the Leuconotis subavenis species. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that can store water, a feature adapted to its native arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is valued in horticulture for its resilience and distinctive foliage."
