    "intro": "Leptadenia cymosa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has small, clustered yellow flowers and produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its latex sap, which can be toxic and has been used in traditional medicine."
