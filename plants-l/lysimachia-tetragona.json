It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lysimachia tetragona is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
