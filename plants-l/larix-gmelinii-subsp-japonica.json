It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds surrounded by a wing for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture and reforestation projects."
