    "intro": "Leucothoe angustifolia var. pyrifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it an excellent specimen plant for shaded landscapes."
