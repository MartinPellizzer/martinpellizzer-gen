    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. acicularis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are tightly spiraled around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
