    "intro": "Lastreopsis velutina, commonly known as the velvet lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus that gives it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
