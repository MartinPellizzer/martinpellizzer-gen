It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
