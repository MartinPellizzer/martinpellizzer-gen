    "intro": "Loranthus boonei, commonly known as the Boone's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to the death of the host tree over time due to the strain of supporting the parasite. It produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in forested areas."
