    "intro": "Leucaena insularum, commonly known as the island leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. Leucaena insularum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural settings."
