    "intro": "Lycopodium pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
