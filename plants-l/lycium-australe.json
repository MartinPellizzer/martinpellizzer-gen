    "intro": "Lycium australe, commonly known as the Australian boxthorn, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that are edible when ripe. The plant has woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Lycium australe plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals."
