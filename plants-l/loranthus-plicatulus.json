    "intro": "Loranthus plicatulus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus plicatulus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine."
