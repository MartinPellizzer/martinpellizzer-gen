    "intro": "Laphamia rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, symmetrical growth form and a dark, almost black or dark brown thallus. The lichen typically grows on rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions, preferring shaded and humid environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. Laphamia rotundata is often used as an indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in forest ecosystems."
