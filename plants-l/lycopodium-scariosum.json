    "intro": "Lycopodium scariosum, commonly known as the scaly clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium scariosum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
