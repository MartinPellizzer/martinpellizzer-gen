    "intro": "Lycopodium phlegmaria var. mannii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is native to parts of Africa and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its habitat."
