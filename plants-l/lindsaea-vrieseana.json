    "intro": "Lindsaea vrieseana, commonly known as the Vriesean spikerush, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Lindsaea vrieseana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
