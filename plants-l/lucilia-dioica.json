    "intro": "Lucilia dioica, commonly known as the common green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinct black markings on the wings. The plant is not a botanical entity but a fly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. The larvae of Lucilia dioica are often found on decaying organic matter, playing a role in decomposition. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its rapid life cycle."
