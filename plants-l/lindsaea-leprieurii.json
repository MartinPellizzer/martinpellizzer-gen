    "intro": "Lindsaea leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's spikemoss, is a tropical fern ally native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce upright, spike-like clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant is epiphytic, often growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain sporangia that release spores for propagation. Lindsaea leprieurii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
