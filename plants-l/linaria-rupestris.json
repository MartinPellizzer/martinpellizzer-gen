    "intro": "Linaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender stems and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria rupestris is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
