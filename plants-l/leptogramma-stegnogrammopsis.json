    "intro": "Leptogramma stegnogrammopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Leptogrammiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright manner. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Leptogramma stegnogrammopsis is often found in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
