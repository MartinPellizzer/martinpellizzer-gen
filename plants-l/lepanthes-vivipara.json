    "intro": "Lepanthes vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique reproductive method, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Lepanthes vivipara is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
