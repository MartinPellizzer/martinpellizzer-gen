    "intro": "Lastrea prolixa, commonly known as the long-stemmed lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that often forms a bright yellow to orange coloration due to the presence of usnic acid. This lichen thrives on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments, where it can tolerate extreme conditions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like structures that are loosely attached to the substrate. Lastrea prolixa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its habitat."
