    "intro": "Limonium papillatum var. callibotryum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers have a distinctive, spiky appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
