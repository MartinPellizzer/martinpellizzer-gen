    "intro": "Laureola sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen laurel, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are aromatic and fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens. Due to its resilience and attractive appearance, it is often used in landscaping for its year-round visual appeal."
