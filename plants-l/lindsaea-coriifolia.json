    "intro": "Lindsaea coriifolia, commonly known as the coral fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea coriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
