    "intro": "Lactuca racemosa, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, branched inflorescence of small yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its lactiferous tissue that secretes a milky sap."
