    "intro": "Leptochloa coerulescens, commonly known as bluegrass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or saline soils. The plant typically grows in low vegetation communities, often along dunes or in coastal grasslands. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Leptochloa coerulescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
