    "intro": "Lunaria ricotia, commonly known as the moonflower or silverleaf moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its distinctive, orb-shaped seed pods that resemble small moons. The plant produces white or pale purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silver hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
