    "intro": "Lunaria annua var. oppositifolia, commonly known as the moonflower or silver dollar plant, is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that turn a striking silver-blue color when mature, resembling small coins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners interested in night-blooming plants. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
