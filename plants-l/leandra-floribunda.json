    "intro": "Leandra floribunda, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bright yellow, candle-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a compact growth habit with a broad, rounded canopy, making it suitable for ornamental use in warm climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Leandra floribunda is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
