    "intro": "Leptopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Oleandraceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a soft, leathery texture and a distinctive, elongated shape. Leptopteris species are often used in ornamental water gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
