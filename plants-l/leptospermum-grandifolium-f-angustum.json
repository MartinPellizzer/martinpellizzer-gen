It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, showing some tolerance to salt spray. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the broader Leptospermum grandifolium species."
