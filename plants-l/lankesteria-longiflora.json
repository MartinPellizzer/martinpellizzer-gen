    "intro": "Lankesteria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lankesteria, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
