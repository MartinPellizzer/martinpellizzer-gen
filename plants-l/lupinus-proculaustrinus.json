It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Lupinus proculaustrinus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
