    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate wood vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This species is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist meadows, contributing to nitrogen fixation in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
