It features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
