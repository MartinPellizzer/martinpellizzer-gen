This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as boreal forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pink or white and feature two prominent, spurred petals. The subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
