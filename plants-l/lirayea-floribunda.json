    "intro": "Lirayea floribunda, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry habitat. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Lirayea floribunda is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
