    "intro": "Laugeria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved laugeria, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a coarse, rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
