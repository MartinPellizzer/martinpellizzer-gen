    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the club moss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a compact, upright rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is noted for its slow growth and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
