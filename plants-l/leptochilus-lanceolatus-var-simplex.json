    "intro": "Leptochilus lanceolatus var. simplex, commonly known as the slender-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient environments."
