    "intro": "Lachnaea diosmoides var. elatior, commonly known as the greater sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
