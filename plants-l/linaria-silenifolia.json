    "intro": "Linaria silenifolia, commonly known as the Silvery Toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
