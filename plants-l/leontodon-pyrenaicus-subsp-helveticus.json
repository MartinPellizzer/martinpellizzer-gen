    "intro": "Leontodon pyrenaicus subsp. helveticus, commonly known as the Alpine wallflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often on slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
