    "intro": "Lilaea, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, characterized by their cold, harsh environments. They produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to white, often with a violet or purple hue. Lilaea species are generally herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves. Their ability to thrive in high altitudes makes them an important component of alpine ecosystems."
