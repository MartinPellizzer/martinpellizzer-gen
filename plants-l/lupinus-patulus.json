    "intro": "Lupinus patulus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus patulus is often found in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant growth in its habitat."
