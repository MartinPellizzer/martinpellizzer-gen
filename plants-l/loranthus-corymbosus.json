    "intro": "Loranthus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Myrtaceae and Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that contain sticky seeds for dispersal. Its growth is dependent on the host tree, and it can cause stress or even death to the host if left unchecked. Loranthus corymbosus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
