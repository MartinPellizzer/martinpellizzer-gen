    "intro": "Lygodium heterophyllum, commonly known as the little fern or water fern, is a tropical climbing fern native to Southeast Asia. It has feather-like fronds with small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in wet, humid environments and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. It can grow rapidly and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its ability to spread through spores makes it a resilient and persistent weed."
