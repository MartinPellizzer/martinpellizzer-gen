    "intro": "Linostoma andamanicum, commonly known as the Andaman rock fern, is a unique fern species native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is typically found growing on rocky substrates. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
