    "intro": "Lepanthes vermicularis, commonly known as the thread-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees in tropical rainforests, relying on its roots for nutrients and moisture. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, thread-like texture, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Lepanthes vermicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
