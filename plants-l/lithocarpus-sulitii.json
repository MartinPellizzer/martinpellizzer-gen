    "intro": "Lithocarpus sulitii, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, nut-like fruits that are enclosed in a spiny husk, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
