    "intro": "Lepanthes perdita, commonly known as the lost lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its long, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Lepanthes perdita is known for its fragrant blooms, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
