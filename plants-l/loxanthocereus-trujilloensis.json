    "intro": "Loxanthocereus trujilloensis, commonly known as the Trujillo night-blooming cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water. It produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
