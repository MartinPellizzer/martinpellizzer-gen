    "intro": "Lepturus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in specific microhabitats, typically on the bark of certain trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant's structure is a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungus and its photobiont. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Lepturus perrieri is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
