    "intro": "Lasiagrostis calamagrostis var. major, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. This variety is distinguished by its larger size compared to other varieties within the calamagrostis species."
