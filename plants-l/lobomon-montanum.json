    "intro": "Lobomon montanum, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lobomon montanum plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
