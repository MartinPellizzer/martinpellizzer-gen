    "intro": "Lithocardium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Lithocardium glabrum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in well-drained soils. Its unique adaptations make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for xeriscaping."
