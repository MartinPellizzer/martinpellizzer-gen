    "intro": "Lupinus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, spiny pods and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, compound leaves and produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots, contributing to soil fertility. Lupinus microcarpus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
