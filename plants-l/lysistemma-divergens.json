    "intro": "Lysistemma divergens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with woody stems and fuzzy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a natural defense mechanism. Lysistemma divergens plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
