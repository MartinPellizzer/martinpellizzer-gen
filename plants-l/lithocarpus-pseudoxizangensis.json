    "intro": "Lithocarpus pseudoxizangensis, commonly known as the Xizang stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and hard, woody structure. It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant produces small, persistent nuts enclosed in a thick, leathery cupule, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its leaves are usually\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing food for various wildlife species."
