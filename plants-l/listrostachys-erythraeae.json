    "intro": "Listrostachys erythraeae, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and woody, aromatic bark. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it is known for its slow growth rate. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
