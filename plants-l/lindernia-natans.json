    "intro": "Lindernia natans, commonly known as floating heart, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, giving it its common name. The plant has small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. Lindernia natans thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective colonizer of wetland habitats."
