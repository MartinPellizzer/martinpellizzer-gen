    "intro": "Lepanthes lilliputae, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white with intricate patterns. The plant grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its tiny size, often less than 2 inches tall, makes it one of the smallest orchid species. Lepanthes lilliputae thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
