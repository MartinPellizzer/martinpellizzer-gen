    "intro": "Lilium neligherrense, commonly known as the Neligherren's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous underground storage organs typical of the lily family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
