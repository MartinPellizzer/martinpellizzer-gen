    "intro": "Lyciodes obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps in reducing water loss. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains the plant's seeds."
