    "intro": "Lasiochlamys trichostemona, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain areas."
