    "intro": "Laguncularia rosea, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody, evergreen structure and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help in gas exchange and provide structural support. Its small, white flowers are followed by edible, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Laguncularia rosea plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
