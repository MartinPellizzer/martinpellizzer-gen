    "intro": "Lycopodium haeckelii, commonly known as the Haeckel's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium haeckelii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky soils or forest understories. Its historical significance in botanical studies lies in its simple, ancient structure, which provides insights into the evolution of early land plants."
