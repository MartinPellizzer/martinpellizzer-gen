    "intro": "Lepiderema, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate or opposite, with lanceolate or ovate shapes and hairy surfaces. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lepiderema species are often found in grasslands and open habitats, and some are used in traditional medicine."
