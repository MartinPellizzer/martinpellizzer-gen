    "intro": "Luzula alpinopilosa subsp. velenovskyi, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
