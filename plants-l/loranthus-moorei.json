    "intro": "Loranthus moorei, commonly known as the Moore's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Myrtaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, spherical growth that can weigh several kilograms, often causing structural stress on the host tree. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Loranthus moorei is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia."
