    "intro": "Lappula pustulata, commonly known as the bladderweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive bladder-like structures on its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lappula pustulata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
