    "intro": "Lewisia oppositifolia, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid mountain habitat. The plant produces striking clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
