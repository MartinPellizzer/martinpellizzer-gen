    "intro": "Lychnis sibirica var. glabra, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh winters. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
