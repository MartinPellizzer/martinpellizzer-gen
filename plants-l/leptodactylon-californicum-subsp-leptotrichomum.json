    "intro": "Leptodactylon californicum subsp. leptotrichomum, commonly known as the California leathery fern, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
