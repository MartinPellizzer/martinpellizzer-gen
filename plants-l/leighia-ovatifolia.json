    "intro": "Leighia ovatifolia, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky and humid environments, often on cliffs or in cloud forests. Its leaves are ovate and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Leighia ovatifolia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
