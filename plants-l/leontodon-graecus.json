    "intro": "Leontodon graecus, commonly known as the Greek dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers develop into fluffy, white pappus-based seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Leontodon graecus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
