    "intro": "Listrobanthes khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. It is an annual herb that plays a role in the local aquatic ecosystem by serving as a food source for various invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations."
