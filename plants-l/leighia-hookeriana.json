    "intro": "Leighia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leighia hookeriana is considered a conservation concern."
