    "intro": "Lemna paucicostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float. It reproduces vegetatively through the production of tiny, green offspring called tubers, which can quickly colonize water bodies. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
