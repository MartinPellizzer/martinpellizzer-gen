    "intro": "Lawrencia diffusa, commonly known as the common green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically sheet-like and composed of a single layer of cells. This plant thrives in marine environments, often found attached to rocks or other substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its simple structure allows it to absorb nutrients directly from the surrounding water. Lawrencia diffusa plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
