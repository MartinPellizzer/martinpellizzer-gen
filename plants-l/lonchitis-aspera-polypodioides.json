    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera polypodioides, commonly known as the rough-hairy fern, is a species of polypodioid fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It typically features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species within the Polypodiaceae family."
