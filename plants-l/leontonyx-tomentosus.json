    "intro": "Leontonyx tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, woolly appearance due to its thick, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique structure make it an important indicator of environmental health."
