    "intro": "Leptochilus perakensis, commonly known as the Perak rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Malaysia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has delicate, lanceolate fronds with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces small, sporangium-bearing sori along the margins of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptochilus perakensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
