    "intro": "Lourteigia stoechadifolia, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Lourteigia stoechadifolia is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
