    "intro": "Lithocardium obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats along the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lithocardium obliquum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
