    "intro": "Lennoa madreporoides subsp. reichei, commonly known as the Red Sea sponge spire, is a rare and distinctive marine sponge found in the Red Sea. It belongs to the family Halichondriidae and is characterized by its unique, spire-like structure composed of a dense network of spongin fibers. The sponge exhibits a pale pink to reddish coloration, which is due to the presence of specific pigments within its cells. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important indicator species for marine biodiversity in the region."
