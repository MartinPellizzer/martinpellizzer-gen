    "intro": "Lycopodium semicordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and small, cone-like strobila that produce spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a distinctive heart-shaped base on some leaves, giving it its common name. Lycopodium semicordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
