    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and somewhat woody. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to spread and form dense ground cover."
