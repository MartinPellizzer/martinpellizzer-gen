    "intro": "Lactuca intricatissima, commonly known as the intricate lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments. While not commonly cultivated for food, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage."
