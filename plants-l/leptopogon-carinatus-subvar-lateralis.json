    "intro": "Leptopogon carinatus subvar. lateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense tussocks, often growing in open, sunny habitats. The plant has a fibrous root system and is typically found in coastal and lowland areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to the temperate climate of its native range."
