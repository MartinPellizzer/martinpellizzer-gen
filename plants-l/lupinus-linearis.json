    "intro": "Lupinus linearis, commonly known as slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, linear leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spiny pods containing small, bean-like seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Lupinus linearis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
