    "intro": "Lonicera baltica, commonly known as the Baltic honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, providing a lush green foliage throughout the growing season. The berries that follow the flowers are red or orange, often persisting into autumn and serving as a food source for birds."
