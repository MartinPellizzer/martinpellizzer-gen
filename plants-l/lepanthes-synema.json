    "intro": "Lepanthes synema, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display shades of purple and white. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Lepanthes synema is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
