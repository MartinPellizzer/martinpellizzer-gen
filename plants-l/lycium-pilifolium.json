    "intro": "Lycium pilifolium, commonly known as the Chinese wolfberry or Goji berry plant, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems, small green leaves, and bright orange-red berries that ripen in the fall. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for drought-prone environments."
