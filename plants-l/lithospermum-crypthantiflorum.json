    "intro": "Lithospermum crypthantiflorum, commonly known as the hidden-flower rock pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Its roots produce a red, staining pigment called lithospermic acid, which has been used in traditional medicine. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
