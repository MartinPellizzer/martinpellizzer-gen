    "intro": "Loxotrema davisii, commonly known as the Davis' lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with distinct lobes and a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is essential for its survival and growth. It is often found on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree bark and rocks in temperate forest environments. Loxotrema davisii is a relatively rare species, and its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions."
