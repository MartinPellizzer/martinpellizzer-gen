    "intro": "Lactuca nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically pale green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
