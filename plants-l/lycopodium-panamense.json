    "intro": "Lycopodium panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
