    "intro": "Leiocarpus, commonly known as the \"southern arrowhead,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. They are characterized by their arrowhead-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a distinctive purple or pink hue. The genus includes several species, such as *Leiocarpus amplus* and *Leiocarpus filicifolius*, which are often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The seeds of Leiocarpus are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by water, contributing to their ecological role in riparian habitats."
