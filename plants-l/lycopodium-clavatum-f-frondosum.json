    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. frondosum, commonly known as the ferny clubmoss, is a variant of the common clubmoss characterized by its more elaborate and fern-like foliage. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae, and it exhibits a unique combination of moss-like and fern-like features. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in clusters called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The frondosum form is distinguished by its more branched and leafy structure compared to the typical clubmoss form."
