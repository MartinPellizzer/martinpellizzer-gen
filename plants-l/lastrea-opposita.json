    "intro": "Lastrea opposita, commonly known as the opposite-leaved rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
