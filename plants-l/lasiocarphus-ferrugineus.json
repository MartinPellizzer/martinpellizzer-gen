    "intro": "Lasiocarphus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of rust-colored hairs, which gives it its common name. Lasiocarphus ferrugineus is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
