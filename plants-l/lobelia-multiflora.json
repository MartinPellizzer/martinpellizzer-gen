    "intro": "Lobelia multiflora, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Lobelia multiflora is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
