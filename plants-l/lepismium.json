    "intro": "Lepismium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. Lepismium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit. They require well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making them suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
