    "intro": "Lewisia stebbinsii, commonly known as the Stebbins' Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of Oregon and California. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and cool summers. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and is considered a rare and valuable species."
