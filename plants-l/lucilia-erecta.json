    "intro": "Lucilia erecta, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of blow fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive eye structure, with males having prominent eye facets. The plant-like appearance of its larvae, which are often found on decaying organic matter, has led to its association with decomposition. Lucilia erecta plays a significant role in forensic entomology due to its rapid development and presence in decomposing material. Its life cycle and ecological impact make it an important subject in both scientific and environmental studies."
