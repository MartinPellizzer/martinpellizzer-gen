    "intro": "Lespedeza juncea var. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its seeds are small and clustered in pods. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
