    "intro": "Lithomyrtus repens, commonly known as the creeping myrtle, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Lithomyrtus repens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal landscapes."
