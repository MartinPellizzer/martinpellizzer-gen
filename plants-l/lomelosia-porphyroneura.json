    "intro": "Lomelosia porphyroneura, commonly known as the red-veined lomelosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a lighter background. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a glossy surface that reflects light, enhancing its visual appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
