    "intro": "Lepanthes macrostylis, commonly known as the large-styled slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a prominent, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy."
