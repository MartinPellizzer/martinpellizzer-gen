    "intro": "Lobivia aurea var. dobeana, commonly known as the Dobeana Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a dense covering of fine, white to pale blue hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
