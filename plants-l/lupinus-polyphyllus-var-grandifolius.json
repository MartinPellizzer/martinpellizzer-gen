It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting large, palmately compound leaves with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
