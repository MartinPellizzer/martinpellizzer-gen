It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Due to its striking foliage, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens."
