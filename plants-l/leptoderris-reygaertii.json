    "intro": "Leptoderris reygaertii, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, pale bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
