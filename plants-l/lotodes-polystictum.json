    "intro": "Lotodes polystictum, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a dark purple center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its leaves and flowers rise to the water's surface. The water lily plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
