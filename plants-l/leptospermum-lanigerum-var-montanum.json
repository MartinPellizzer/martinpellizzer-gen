It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. This variety is often found in heathlands and open forests, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
