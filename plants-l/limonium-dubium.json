    "intro": "Limonium dubium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Limonium dubium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
