    "intro": "Luzula sylvatica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
