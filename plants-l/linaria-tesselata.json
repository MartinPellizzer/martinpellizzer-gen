    "intro": "Linaria tesselata, commonly known as the zigzag toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem, giving it its common name. Linaria tesselata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
