    "intro": "Lonicera gibbosa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries, which are orange-red when mature, are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera gibbosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
