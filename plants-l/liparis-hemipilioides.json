    "intro": "Liparis hemipilioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, moist soil. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in two rows along the stem. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on specific insects for reproduction."
