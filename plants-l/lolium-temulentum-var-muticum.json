    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. muticum, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial grassy plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
