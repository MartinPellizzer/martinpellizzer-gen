    "intro": "Lachemilla hispidula, commonly known as the rough leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, often reddish stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters near the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
