    "intro": "Lissochilus lacteus, commonly known as the milk orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant produces a distinctive, milky sap that gives it its common name. Lissochilus lacteus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
