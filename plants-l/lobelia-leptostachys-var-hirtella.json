It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
