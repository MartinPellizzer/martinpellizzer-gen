    "intro": "Lepisorus pygmaeus, commonly known as the miniature water fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus pygmaeus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
