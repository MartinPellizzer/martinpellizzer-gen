It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit, a small, red berry, matures in the fall and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
