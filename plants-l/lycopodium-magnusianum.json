    "intro": "Lycopodium magnusianum, commonly known as the Magnusian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures called strobili. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait typical of ancient plant groups. Its presence in forest ecosystems contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
