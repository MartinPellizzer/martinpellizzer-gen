    "intro": "Lantana urticoides f. aculeata, commonly known as the rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is part of the Verbenaceae family and is known for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
