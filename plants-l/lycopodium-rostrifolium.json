    "intro": "Lycopodium rostrifolium, commonly known as the rostrifolium clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. Its sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium rostrifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
