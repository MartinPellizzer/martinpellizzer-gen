    "intro": "Loxocarya fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Loxocarya fasciculata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation."
