    "intro": "Lunaria rediviva var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple moonflower, is a striking member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, orb-shaped seed pods that turn a deep purple as they mature. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
