    "intro": "Leptogramma lowei, commonly known as the Low's leptogramma, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a striking silver or gray-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical or subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns and contribute to its classification. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leptogramma lowei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
