    "intro": "Ligusticum flabellatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved angelica, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, fern-like, bipinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
