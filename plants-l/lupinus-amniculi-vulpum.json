    "intro": "Lupinus amniculi-vulpum, commonly known as the river wolfbean, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
