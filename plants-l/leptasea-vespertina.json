It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom predominantly in the late afternoon or evening, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are elongated and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by nocturnal insects."
