    "intro": "Lacinaria scariosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces tiny, white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it thrives in nutrient-poor water conditions. This variant is noted for its adaptability and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
