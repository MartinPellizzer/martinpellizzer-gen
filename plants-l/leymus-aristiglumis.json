    "intro": "Leymus aristiglumis, commonly known as the arrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with the lemma and palea bearing distinctive awns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Leymus aristiglumis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
