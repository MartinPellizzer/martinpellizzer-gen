    "intro": "Leptorhabdos, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, hairy seed pods that disperse wind-borne seeds. Leptorhabdos is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it a resilient and hardy species often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas."
