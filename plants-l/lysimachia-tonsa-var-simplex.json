    "intro": "Lysimachia tonsa var. simplex, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
