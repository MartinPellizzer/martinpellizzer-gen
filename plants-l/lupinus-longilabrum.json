    "intro": "Lupinus longilabrum, commonly known as the long-labied lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus longilabrum has small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
