    "intro": "Limnanthemum kleinianum, commonly known as the Klein's water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
