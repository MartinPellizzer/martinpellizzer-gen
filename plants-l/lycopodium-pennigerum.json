    "intro": "Lycopodium pennigerum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of pine needles, though it is not a true conifer. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium pennigerum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
