    "intro": "Lasianthus foetulentus var. pseudovarians, commonly known as the stinking water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. The varietal form, pseudovarians, differs slightly in leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical species."
