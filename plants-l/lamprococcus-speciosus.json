    "intro": "Lamprococcus speciosus, commonly known as the golden wax scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its elongated, golden-brown body covered in a waxy, protective coating. The plant hosts of this species are typically broad-leaved evergreens, particularly species within the family Ericaceae. Lamprococcus speciosus feeds on the sap of its host plants, causing deformation and discoloration of leaves. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for a decorative plant rather than a pest."
