    "intro": "Luzuriaga latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf luzuriaga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are broad and leathery, adapted to the cold and nutrient-poor environments where it thrives. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Luzuriaga latifolia is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
