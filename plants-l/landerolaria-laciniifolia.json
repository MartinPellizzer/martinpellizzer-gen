The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique foliage and modest flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
