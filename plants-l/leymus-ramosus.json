    "intro": "Leymus ramosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned lemmas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and riparian areas. Leymus ramosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
