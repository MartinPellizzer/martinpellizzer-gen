It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often resembling those of oregano, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
