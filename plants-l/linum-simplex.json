    "intro": "Linum simplex, commonly known as common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces blue or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a capsule and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of linseed oil. Linum simplex thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides."
