    "intro": "Limonium amblyolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. It is a perennial species that is well adapted to saline and windy environments. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
