It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is native to regions in Asia and Africa, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
