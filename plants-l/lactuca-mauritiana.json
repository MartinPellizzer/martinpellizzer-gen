    "intro": "Lactuca mauritiana, commonly known as wild endive, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and broad, waxy, lobed leaves that are often curly or frilled. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and can be used in salads or cooked, though they have a slightly bitter taste. Lactuca mauritiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
