    "intro": "Limnophila fluviatilis f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort species that exhibits adaptations to grow in moist terrestrial environments rather than aquatic ones. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can access the necessary humidity and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland ecosystems."
