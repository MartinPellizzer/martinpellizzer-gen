    "intro": "Leontochir, commonly known as the lion's claw, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like seed pods that give the plant its common name. The species typically grow in temperate regions, often in rocky or woodland habitats. The leaves are usually trifoliate, and the flowers are small, clustered, and often have a pink or purple hue. Leontochir plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
