    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum var. erectum, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a rare and diminutive vascular plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, erect stems and spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
