    "intro": "Leucothoe albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowers, and berries, as well as its ability to support local wildlife."
