    "intro": "Ledermanniella thalloidea, commonly known as the flat thalloid lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its broad, flat thallus that often forms dense mats on rock surfaces. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal mycobiont, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its surface is usually smooth or slightly lobed, with a pale to dark green or yellowish coloration. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
