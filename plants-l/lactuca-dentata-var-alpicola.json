    "intro": "Lactuca dentata var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine lettuce, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, toothed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its edible leaves in high-altitude gardens."
