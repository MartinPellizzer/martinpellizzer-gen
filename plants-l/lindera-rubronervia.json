    "intro": "Lindera rubronervia, commonly known as red-veined ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves with prominent reddish veins that are most visible during the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
