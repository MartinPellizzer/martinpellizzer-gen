It is a climbing legume characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. Its fruits are slender pods containing several elliptical seeds. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
