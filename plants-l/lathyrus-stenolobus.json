    "intro": "Lathyrus stenolobus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lathyrus stenolobus is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant."
