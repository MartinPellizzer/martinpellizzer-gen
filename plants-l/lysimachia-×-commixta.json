    "intro": "Lysimachia \u00d7 commixta, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lysimachia nummularia and Lysimachia vulgaris. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded garden environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers throughout the growing season. Lysimachia \u00d7 commixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread readily through rhizomes."
