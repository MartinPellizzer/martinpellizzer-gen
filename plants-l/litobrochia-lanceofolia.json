    "intro": "Litobrochia lanceofolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf litobrochia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually displaying shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
