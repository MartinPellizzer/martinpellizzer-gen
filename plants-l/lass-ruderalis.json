    "intro": "Lass ruderalis, commonly known as the wild hemp, is a dioecious plant belonging to the Cannabaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with slender stems and palmate leaves that are usually hairy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is known for its fibrous, robust stalks. Lass ruderalis is notable for its low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content and is often used in the cultivation of industrial hemp varieties."
