    "intro": "Lilium leucanthum var. sargentiae, commonly known as the Sargent's white lily, is a rare and striking variant of the white lily native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, pale to white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, often featuring a prominent central stigma. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with strap-like, grassy leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude environments. This variety is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
