    "intro": "Larix griffithii var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the autumn. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is smooth and reddish-gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine regions."
