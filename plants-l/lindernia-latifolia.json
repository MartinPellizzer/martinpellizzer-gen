    "intro": "Lindernia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
