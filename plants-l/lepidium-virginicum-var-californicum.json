    "intro": "Lepidium virginicum var. californicum, commonly known as California peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. This annual herb typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and open woodlands. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
