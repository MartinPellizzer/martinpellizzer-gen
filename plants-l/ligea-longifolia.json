    "intro": "Ligea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf ligea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Ligea longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
