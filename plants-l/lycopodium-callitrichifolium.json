    "intro": "Lycopodium callitrichifolium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces sporangia that release spores, which are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium callitrichifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
