    "intro": "Lavoisiera subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf lavoisiera, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Lavoisiera subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique foliage."
