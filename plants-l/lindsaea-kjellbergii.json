    "intro": "Lindsaea kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg\u2019s spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces distinctive spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea kjellbergii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat."
