    "intro": "Lamprodithyros rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant thrives in slow-moving streams and rivers, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for clean, well-oxygenated water."
