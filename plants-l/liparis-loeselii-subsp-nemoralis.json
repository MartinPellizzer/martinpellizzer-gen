    "intro": "Liparis loeselii subsp. nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike that produces a single, pale green to brownish flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often overlooked due to their subdued coloration. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and limited distribution."
