    "intro": "Lettsomia ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid tropical environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Lettsomia ridleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
