    "intro": "Lampranthus ceriseus, commonly known as the pink devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking pink to magenta flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its environment. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
