It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a rosette of elongated, upright leaves. Romaine lettuce is prized for its nutritional value, containing high levels of vitamins A and K, and is widely used in salads and sandwiches.
