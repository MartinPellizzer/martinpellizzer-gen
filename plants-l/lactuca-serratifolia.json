    "intro": "Lactuca serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated lettuce or prickly lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Lactuca serratifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
