    "intro": "Lomastelma, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Moraceae. These plants are characterized by their twining stems that allow them to climb and entangle other vegetation. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a heart-shaped base. They produce small, clustered inflorescences that develop into edible fruits similar to figs. Lomastelma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and are often used in traditional medicine."
