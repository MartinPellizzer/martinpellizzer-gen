    "intro": "Lankesteriana edmeiae, commonly known as the Edmea's lankesteriana, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and elongated, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
