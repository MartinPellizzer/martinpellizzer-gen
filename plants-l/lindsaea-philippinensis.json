    "intro": "Lindsaea philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant is native to the Philippines, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Lindsaea philippinensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
