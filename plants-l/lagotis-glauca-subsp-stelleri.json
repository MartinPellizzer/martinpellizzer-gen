    "intro": "Lagotis glauca subsp. stelleri, commonly known as Steller's lagotis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
