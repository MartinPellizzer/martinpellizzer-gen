    "intro": "Leuconotis floribunda, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Leuconotis floribunda is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
