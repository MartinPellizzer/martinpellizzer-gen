    "intro": "Lychnis frigida, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and high altitudes. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lychnis frigida is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to grow in full sun."
