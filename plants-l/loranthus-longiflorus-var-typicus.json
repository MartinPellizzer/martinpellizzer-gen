    "intro": "Loranthus longiflorus var. typicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, where it plays a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
