    "intro": "Lathyrus gracilis, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus gracilis is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
