    "intro": "Lotononis acutiflora, commonly known as the sharpflower sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist to aquatic environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its flowers are often clustered in dense spikes, and it blooms during the late summer and autumn months. Lotononis acutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a landscape plant."
