It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Limonium albomarginatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
