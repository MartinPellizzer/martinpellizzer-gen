    "intro": "Lotononis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved lotononis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
