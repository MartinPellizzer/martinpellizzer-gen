    "intro": "Ligustrum sinense nanum, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is also sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
