    "intro": "Lasiochloa ciliaris, commonly known as the silky grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to the presence of fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a compact cluster of spikelets, which are often covered in silky hairs."
