    "intro": "Litsea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy litsea, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use. Litsea pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
