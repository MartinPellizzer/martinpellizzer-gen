    "intro": "Lolium perenne f. tenue, commonly known as slender perennial ryegrass, is a variant of perennial ryegrass characterized by its thinner, more delicate leaves. This form is often found in grasslands and lawns, where it contributes to the overall density and texture of the vegetation. It is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its rapid establishment and good forage quality. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it a useful species in agricultural and horticultural settings."
