    "intro": "Leptocladus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
