    "intro": "Leucopogon maritimus, commonly known as the sea heath, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Leucopogon maritimus is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
