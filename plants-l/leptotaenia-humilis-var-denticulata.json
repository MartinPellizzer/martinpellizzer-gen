    "intro": "Leptotaenia humilis var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae (grass) family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
