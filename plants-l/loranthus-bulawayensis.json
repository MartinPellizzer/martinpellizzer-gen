    "intro": "Loranthus bulawayensis, commonly known as the Bulawayo mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to southern Africa, particularly Zimbabwe. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are usually clustered in short inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging."
