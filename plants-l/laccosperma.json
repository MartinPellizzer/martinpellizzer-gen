It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, particularly in tropical regions. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy, clustered flowers. Laccosperma species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. They also play an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
