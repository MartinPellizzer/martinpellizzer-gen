    "intro": "Lotus glaucus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the blue lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its stems are submerged, supporting the showy floral display. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
