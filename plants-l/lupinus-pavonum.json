It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble the tail of a peacock, giving it its common name. The plant produces erect, spindly stems with clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and blue. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus pavonum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
