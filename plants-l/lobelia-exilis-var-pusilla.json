    "intro": "Lobelia exilis var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
