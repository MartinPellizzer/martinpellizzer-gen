It is a slow-growing cactus that forms a dense, rounded crown with numerous short, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique structure and flowering habit make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
