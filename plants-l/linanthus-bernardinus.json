    "intro": "Linanthus bernardinus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Linanthus bernardinus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to desert environments."
