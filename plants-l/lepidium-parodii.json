    "intro": "Lepidium parodii, commonly known as the \"Peruvian mountain cress,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters, producing small, rounded seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Lepidium parodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
