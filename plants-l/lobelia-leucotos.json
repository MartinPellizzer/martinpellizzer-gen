    "intro": "Lobelia leucotos, commonly known as white lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
