    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla var. dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctively two-toned flowers, which typically feature a yellow base and a red or orange upper lip. The plant has opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that vary in size depending on the growing conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
