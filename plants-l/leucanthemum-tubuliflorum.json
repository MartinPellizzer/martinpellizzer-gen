    "intro": "Leucanthemum tubuliflorum, commonly known as the oxeye daisy, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy white ray florets surrounding a central yellow disk, giving it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often branched. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
