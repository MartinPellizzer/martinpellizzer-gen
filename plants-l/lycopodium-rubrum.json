    "intro": "Lycopodium rubrum, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium rubrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
