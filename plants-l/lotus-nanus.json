It typically grows in shallow waters and is characterized by its small, floating leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Lotus nanus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
