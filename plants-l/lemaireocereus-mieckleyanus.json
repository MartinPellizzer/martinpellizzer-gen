    "intro": "Lemaireocereus mieckleyanus, commonly known as the Mieckley's night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing in the early morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments."
