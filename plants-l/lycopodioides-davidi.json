    "intro": "Lycopodioides davidi, commonly known as the David's clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome and erect, slender stems that bear scale-like leaves. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
