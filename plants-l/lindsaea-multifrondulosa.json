    "intro": "Lindsaea multifrondulosa, commonly known as the many-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, overlapping layers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a thick, spongy layer of tissue that aids in water retention. Lindsaea multifrondulosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
