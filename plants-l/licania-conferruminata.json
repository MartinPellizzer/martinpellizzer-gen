    "intro": "Licania conferruminata, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense canopy. The plant thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saline water, which allows it to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various species."
