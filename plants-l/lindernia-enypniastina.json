    "intro": "Lindernia enypniastina, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and Central America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense spikes at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last from spring through fall."
