    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum f. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a rare fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other clubmoss species. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
