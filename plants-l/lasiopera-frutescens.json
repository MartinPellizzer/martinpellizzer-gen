    "intro": "Lasiopera frutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched structure and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
