    "intro": "Lilium duchartrei var. lankongense, commonly known as the Lankong lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms with six petals, and its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
