    "intro": "Languas calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Languas calcarata is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of poor soil conditions."
