    "intro": "Lomatium simplex, commonly known as western lomatium, is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Lomatium simplex is also an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
