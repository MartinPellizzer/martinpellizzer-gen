    "intro": "Lycopodium sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium sieboldii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
