    "intro": "Lepanthes scansor, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Lepanthes scansor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
