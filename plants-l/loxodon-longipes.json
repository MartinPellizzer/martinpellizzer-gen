    "intro": "Loxodon longipes, commonly known as the long-footed lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that forms a tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, bark, or stone. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
