    "intro": "Legnotis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant white wood fern, is a striking plant native to the temperate rainforests of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to two meters in length, with a distinctive white underside that becomes visible when the leaves are folded. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found along stream banks and in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Legnotis macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
