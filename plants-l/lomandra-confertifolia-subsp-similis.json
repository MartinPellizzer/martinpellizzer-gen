    "intro": "Lomandra confertifolia subsp. similis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and arranged in a rosette, with a fibrous root system typical of the Lomandra genus. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandplain habitats. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in native gardens."
