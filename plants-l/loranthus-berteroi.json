    "intro": "Loranthus berteroi, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant has fleshy, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing the growth and health of its host trees."
