    "intro": "Lolium jechelianum, commonly known as the Jechelian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend toward the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in groups of three, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Lolium jechelianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its unique appearance."
