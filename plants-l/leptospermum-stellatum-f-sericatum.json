    "intro": "Leptospermum stellatum f. sericatum, commonly known as the silver-leaved tea tree, is a variant of the coastal tea tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
