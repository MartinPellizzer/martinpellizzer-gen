    "intro": "Lupinus bivonii, commonly known as the Bivon's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy, spicate flower clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Lupinus bivonii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
