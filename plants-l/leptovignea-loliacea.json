It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for certain insects. Its ecological significance is further enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
