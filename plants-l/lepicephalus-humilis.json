    "intro": "Lepicephalus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that typically grows on soil, rocks, or wood in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, foliose thallus that often forms dense mats. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It lacks distinct leaves or stems, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Lepicephalus humilis is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution."
