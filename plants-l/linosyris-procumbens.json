    "intro": "Linosyris procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate linosyris, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a sprawling habit with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Linosyris procumbens is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
