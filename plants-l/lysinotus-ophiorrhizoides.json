    "intro": "Lysinotus ophiorrhizoides, commonly known as the climbing lygodium, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of specialized roots called rhizomes, which help it anchor to trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in certain horticultural settings. Lysinotus ophiorrhizoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
