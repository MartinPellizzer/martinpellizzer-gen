    "intro": "Lorentea cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Lorentea cubensis is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
