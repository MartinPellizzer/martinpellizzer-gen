    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius proles linifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use as a forage crop."
