    "intro": "Lyonia capreifolia, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Lyonia capreifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
