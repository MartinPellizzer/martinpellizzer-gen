    "intro": "Lespedeza pilosa var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Broadleaf lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
