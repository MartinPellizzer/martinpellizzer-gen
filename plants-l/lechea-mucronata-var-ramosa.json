    "intro": "Lechea mucronata var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the dry season. It is adapted to grow in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The milky sap it exudes is a distinguishing feature, though it is not particularly toxic to humans."
