    "intro": "Lomaria cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon lomatia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. Its foliage is evergreen, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Lomaria cinnamomea is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
