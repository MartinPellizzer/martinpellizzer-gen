    "intro": "Lathyrus foliaceopetiolatus, commonly known as the leafy petioled vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with elongated petioles. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along field edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
