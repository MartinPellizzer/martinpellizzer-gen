    "intro": "Loranthus periclymenoides, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often visited by bees and other insects. Its berries, which are bright red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This parasitic species plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the health and diversity of its host trees."
