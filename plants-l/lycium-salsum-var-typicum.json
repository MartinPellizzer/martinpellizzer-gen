    "intro": "Lycium salsum var. typicum, commonly known as saltbush or coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, often blue or purple berries and its ability to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to harsh climates. It produces flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties in traditional practices."
