    "intro": "Lysionotus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple-flowered sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, tubular, purple to pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
