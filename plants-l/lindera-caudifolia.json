    "intro": "Lindera caudifolia, commonly known as the fragrant spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
