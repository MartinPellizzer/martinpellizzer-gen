It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Lobivia haematantha is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry conditions."
