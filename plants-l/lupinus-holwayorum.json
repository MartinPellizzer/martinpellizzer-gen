    "intro": "Lupinus holwayorum, commonly known as the Holway's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Lupinus holwayorum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
