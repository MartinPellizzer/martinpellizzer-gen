    "intro": "Lunathyrium henryi, commonly known as Henry's moonwort, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped sporangia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinct, almost prehistoric appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
