    "intro": "Leioluma lucens, commonly known as the glowing fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its bioluminescent properties. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a soft blue light at night, a trait attributed to specialized luciferin-luciferase reactions. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches to trees without deriving nutrients from them. The botanical significance of Leioluma lucens lies in its potential applications in biotechnology and ecological research."
