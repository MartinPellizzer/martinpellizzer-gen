    "intro": "Lepidium ramosissimum, commonly known as wild rocket, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, green, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, round pods that split open to release the seeds. Lepidium ramosissimum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
