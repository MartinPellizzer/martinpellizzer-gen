    "intro": "Lautea collenettei var. primaeva, commonly known as the dawn's first bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals that open at dawn, emitting a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
