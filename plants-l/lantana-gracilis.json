    "intro": "Lantana gracilis, commonly known as slender lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, red, and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a tendency to spread via trailing stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings. Lantana gracilis is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
