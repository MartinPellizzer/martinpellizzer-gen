    "intro": "Leptodermis tubicalyx, commonly known as the tubercled leatherleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with four to five petals. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
