    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium sichuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
