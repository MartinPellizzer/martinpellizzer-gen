    "intro": "Limonium spectabile, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its common name reflects its association with coastal environments, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Limonium spectabile is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add color to dry, sunny landscapes."
