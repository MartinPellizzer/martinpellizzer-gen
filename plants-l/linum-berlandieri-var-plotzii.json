    "intro": "Linum berlandieri var. plotzii, commonly known as the Mexican flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to those of the common flax, Linum usitatissimum, but it is more suited to harsh, dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
