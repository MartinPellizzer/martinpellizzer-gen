    "intro": "Lobivia schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
