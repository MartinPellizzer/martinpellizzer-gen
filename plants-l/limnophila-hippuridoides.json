    "intro": "Limnophila hippuridoides, commonly known as the water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, forming dense mats on the surface or submerged in water. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spikes, and it produces small, dark brown fruits. Limnophila hippuridoides plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
