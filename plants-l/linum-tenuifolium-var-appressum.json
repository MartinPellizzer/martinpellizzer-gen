    "intro": "Linum tenuifolium var. appressum, commonly known as narrow-leaved flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to those of the common flax, making it a close relative in the Linaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
