    "intro": "Laciala, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a slender, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Laciala is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
