    "intro": "Lilium sealyi, commonly known as the Sealy lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This perennial herbaceous plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It blooms primarily in late winter to early spring, making it one of the last lilies to flower in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium sealyi is considered a conservation concern."
