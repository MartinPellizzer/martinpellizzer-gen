    "intro": "Lupinus subcarnosus, commonly known as the prickly lupine, is a perennial legume native to western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus subcarnosus has adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native environment."
