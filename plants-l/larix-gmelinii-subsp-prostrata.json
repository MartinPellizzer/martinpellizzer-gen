    "intro": "Larix gmelinii subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate larch, is a low-growing subspecies of the larch tree native to the Far East of Russia. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, forming dense mats of foliage on the ground. The leaves are needle-like, typically 1\u20132 cm long, and turn gold in the fall before shedding. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in mountainous or forested regions with well-drained soils."
