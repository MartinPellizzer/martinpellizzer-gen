    "intro": "Linaria striata var. repens, commonly known as creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
