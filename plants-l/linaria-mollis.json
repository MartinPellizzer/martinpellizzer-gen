    "intro": "Linaria mollis, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers resembling those of the common toadflax. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Linaria mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
