It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates with minimal water requirements."
