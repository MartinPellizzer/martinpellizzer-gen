    "intro": "Lobelia guzmanii, commonly known as the Guzm\u00e1n's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
