    "intro": "Leersia perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Leersia perrieri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
