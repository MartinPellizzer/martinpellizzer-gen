    "intro": "Lastrea filix-mas subvar. nidus, commonly known as the Bird's Nest fern, is a tropical plant native to humid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped fronds that form a nesting-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and leathery, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
