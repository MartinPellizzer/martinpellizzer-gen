    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems that bear clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are linear and finely toothed, adapting to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in cool climates make it a notable ornamental plant in garden settings."
