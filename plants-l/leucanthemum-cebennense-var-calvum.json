    "intro": "Leucanthemum cebennense var. calvum, commonly known as the smooth yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other yarrow species. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with yellow centers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native landscaping."
