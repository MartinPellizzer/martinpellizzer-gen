It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the variety. These flowers are typically followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
