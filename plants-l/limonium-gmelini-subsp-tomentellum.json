    "intro": "Limonium gmelini subsp. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its saline, coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Limonium gmelini subsp. tomentellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
