    "intro": "Lepigonum halophilum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded lands. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters. Lepigonum halophilum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
