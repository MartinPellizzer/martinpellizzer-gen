    "intro": "Leucochrysum albicans, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Leucochrysum albicans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
