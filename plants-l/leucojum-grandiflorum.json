    "intro": "Leucojum grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant white squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of large, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant blooms that resemble lilies, though it is not closely related to them. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Leucojum grandiflorum is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread over time."
