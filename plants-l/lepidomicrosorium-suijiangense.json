    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium suijiangense, commonly known as the Suijiang fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive lepidomorphic structure, with small, scale-like outgrowths along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in terminal clusters, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lepidomicrosorium suijiangense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
