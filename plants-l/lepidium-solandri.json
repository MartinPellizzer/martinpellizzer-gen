    "intro": "Lepidium solandri, commonly known as the coastal rocket, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. Lepidium solandri has hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in its often harsh habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
