    "intro": "Lophophora diffusa var. swobodaiana, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique cacti species native to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces a distinctive seed pod that contains a larvae-infested seed, which is used in traditional practices. The larvae inside the pod move around, causing the pod to \"jump\" when disturbed, a behavior that has intrigued botanists and enthusiasts alike. Due to its rare and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
