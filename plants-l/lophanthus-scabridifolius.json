    "intro": "Lophanthus scabridifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf lophanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, rough texture. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Lophanthus scabridifolius is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
