    "intro": "Laurus lanosa, commonly known as Mediterranean laurel or sweet bay, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are thick and leathery, with a fragrant, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its dense foliage makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. The leaves are often used in cooking, particularly in Mediterranean cuisines, for their distinctive flavor."
