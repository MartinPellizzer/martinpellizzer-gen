    "intro": "Lamium hirsutum, commonly known as hairy deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in woodland areas, along paths, and in shaded gardens, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Lamium hirsutum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
