It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Lupinus nubilorum is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil for other plant species."
