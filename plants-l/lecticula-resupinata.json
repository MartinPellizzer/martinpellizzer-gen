    "intro": "Lecticula resupinata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. Lecticula resupinata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
