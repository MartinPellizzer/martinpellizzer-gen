    "intro": "Licuala densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flower palm, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are densely packed and dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
