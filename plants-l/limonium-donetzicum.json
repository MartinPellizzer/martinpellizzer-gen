    "intro": "Limonium donetzicum, commonly known as the Donetz scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Russia and parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of small, petal-less flowers that are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Limonium donetzicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
