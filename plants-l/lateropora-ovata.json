    "intro": "Lateropora ovata, commonly known as the oval-sided liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with laterally elongated lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Lateropora ovata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
