    "intro": "Loroglossum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows on tree branches in tropical and subtropical regions, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Loroglossum has no leaves, relying instead on its specialized roots for photosynthesis. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
