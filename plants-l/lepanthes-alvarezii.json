    "intro": "Lepanthes alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepanthes alvarezii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
