It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds.
