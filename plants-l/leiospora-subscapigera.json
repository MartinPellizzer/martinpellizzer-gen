    "intro": "Leiospora subscapigera, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a creeping rhizome with small, clustered leaves that are typically light green and have a smooth, leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Leiospora subscapigera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
