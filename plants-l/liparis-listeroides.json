    "intro": "Liparis listeroides, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Liparis listeroides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
