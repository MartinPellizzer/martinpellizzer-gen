    "intro": "Lychnophora hakeifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
