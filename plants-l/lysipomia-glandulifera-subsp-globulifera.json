    "intro": "Lysipomia glandulifera subsp. globulifera, commonly known as the globular cushion plant, is a perennial herb native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
