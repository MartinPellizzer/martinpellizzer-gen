    "intro": "Latua venenosa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking insect with a distinctive black body and a white marking that resembles a skull. It belongs to the family Sphingidae and is known for its long, slender wings and rapid, agile flight. The plant is not actually a plant but a moth, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
