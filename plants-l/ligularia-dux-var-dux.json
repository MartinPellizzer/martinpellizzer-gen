    "intro": "Ligularia dux var. dux, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its foliage is particularly notable for its dramatic size and texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
