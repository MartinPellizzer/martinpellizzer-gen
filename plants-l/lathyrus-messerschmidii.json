    "intro": "Lathyrus messerschmidii, commonly known as the Alpine grass pea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated, but it plays a role in certain traditional ecological systems."
