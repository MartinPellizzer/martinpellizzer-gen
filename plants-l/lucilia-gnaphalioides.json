    "intro": "Lucilia gnaphalioides, commonly known as the common green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive black markings on its abdomen. The plant is not a botanical species but rather a fly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. It is often found near decaying organic matter, where it lays its eggs. This species plays a role in ecological decomposition processes."
