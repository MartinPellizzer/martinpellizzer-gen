    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. arvense, commonly known as dog's-ear grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is closely related to other Lolium species and is sometimes used in forage agriculture."
