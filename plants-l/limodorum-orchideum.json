    "intro": "Limodorum orchideum, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy purple or violet flower that is typically borne on a tall, erect scape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. The flower's structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
