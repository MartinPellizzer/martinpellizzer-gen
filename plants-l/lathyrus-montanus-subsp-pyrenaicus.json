    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus subsp. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean grasspea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, though the foliage and seeds contain toxic alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
