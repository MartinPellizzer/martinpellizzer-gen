    "intro": "Lecythis subbiflora, commonly known as the golden burl apple, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The tree bears heavy, woody fruits with a thick, spiny rind containing a sweet, starchy pulp. Its seeds are encased in a hard, burl-like structure, which is a distinctive feature of the species. Lecythis subbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local communities."
