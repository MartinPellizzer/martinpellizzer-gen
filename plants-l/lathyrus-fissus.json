    "intro": "Lathyrus fissus, commonly known as the fissured vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive fissured leaflet. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus fissus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
