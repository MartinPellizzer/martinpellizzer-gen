    "intro": "Laurus viminea, commonly known as the creeping laurel or sweet bay, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, emitting a subtle, spicy scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and herbal medicine."
