    "intro": "Loranthus albizziae, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily those in the genus Albizia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus albizziae is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
