    "intro": "Leonia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries. Leonia falcata is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
