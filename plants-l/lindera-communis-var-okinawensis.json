    "intro": "Lindera communis var. okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawan spicebush, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are narrow and elliptic, with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral and fruit characteristics compared to the more widespread Lindera communis."
