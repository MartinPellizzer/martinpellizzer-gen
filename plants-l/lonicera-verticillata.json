    "intro": "Lonicera verticillata, commonly known as the whorled honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Lonicera verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
