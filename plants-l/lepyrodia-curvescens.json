    "intro": "Lepyrodia curvescens, commonly known as the curvedleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a dark, leathery surface and a dense, intricate network of rhizines. The plant typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is a non-photosynthetic organism, relying on its algal partner for energy. Lepyrodia curvescens is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
