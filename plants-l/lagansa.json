    "intro": "Lagansa, commonly known as the wild eggplant or *Solanum melongena* var. *laxum*, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that contain numerous seeds. Lagansa is often found growing wild in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated relatives."
