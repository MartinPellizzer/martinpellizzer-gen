    "intro": "Lycopodium myosurus, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of pine needles, though it is not a true conifer. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Lycopodium myosurus is a primitive vascular plant, showcasing features similar to its ancient relatives from the Carboniferous period."
