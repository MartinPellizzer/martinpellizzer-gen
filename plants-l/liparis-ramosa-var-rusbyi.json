    "intro": "Liparis ramosa var. rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. This orchid is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
