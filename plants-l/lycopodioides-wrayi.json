    "intro": "Lycopodioides wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and produces small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. Lycopodioides wrayi reproduces via spores, which are released from cone-like structures called strobila. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical forests."
