    "intro": "Lysimachia capillipes var. capillipes, commonly known as the slender yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and supporting biodiversity."
