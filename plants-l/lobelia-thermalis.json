    "intro": "Lobelia thermalis, commonly known as the thermal lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in geothermal areas where the soil is warmed by underground heat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Lobelia thermalis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators."
