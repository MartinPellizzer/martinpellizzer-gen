    "intro": "Ligusticum nemorosum, commonly known as the wood anise, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, branched stem that grows up to 1 meter in height, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and pinnate, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Ligusticum nemorosum is often found in woodlands and shaded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
