    "intro": "Lepanthes octocornuta, commonly known as the eight-horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature multiple sepals and petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The genus Lepanthes is known for its diversity in floral morphology, and L. octocornuta exemplifies this with its unique, horn-like projections on the petals."
