    "intro": "Loethainia floribunda, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cool climates. Loethainia floribunda is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
