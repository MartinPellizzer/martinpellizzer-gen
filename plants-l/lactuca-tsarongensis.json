    "intro": "Lactuca tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau and neighboring regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, arid conditions. It features basal rosettes of leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Lactuca tsarongensis is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
