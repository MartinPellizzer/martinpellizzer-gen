    "intro": "Lobelia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a yellow or white throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features heart-shaped, large leaves that are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Lobelia macrophylla is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
