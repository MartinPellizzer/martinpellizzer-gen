    "intro": "Lucilia, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a genus of flies belonging to the family Calliphoridae. These insects are characterized by their metallic green or blue coloration and are often found near decaying organic matter. Lucilia species play a role in ecological decomposition by breaking down dead animal tissue. They are also used in forensic science to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations. The larvae, or maggots, are important in natural recycling processes within ecosystems."
