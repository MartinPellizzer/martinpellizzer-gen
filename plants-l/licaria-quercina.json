    "intro": "Licaria quercina, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, spiky, spherical seed capsules that split open to release seeds in the fall. The tree has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, green, and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
