    "intro": "Leontopodium microphyllum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its unique morphology includes a cushion-like growth form that helps it conserve heat and moisture. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
