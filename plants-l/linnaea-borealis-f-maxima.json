    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. maxima, commonly known as the giant twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its larger leaves and flowers compared to the typical species, with leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters of two. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and grows from rhizomes. This form is notable for its increased size and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology."
