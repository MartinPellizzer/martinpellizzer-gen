    "intro": "Lespedeza pseudomacrocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range from pink to reddish-purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that are typically hairy and curved. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Lespedeza pseudomacrocarpa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
