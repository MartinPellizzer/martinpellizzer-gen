    "intro": "Lobivia pygmaea var. iscayachensis, commonly known as the Iscayachensis Lobivia, is a small, compact cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
