    "intro": "Lactaria elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic milk cap, is a species of bolete mushroom characterized by its distinctive cap and stem features. It belongs to the genus Lactaria, which is known for its milky latex that exudes when the cap is cut. The cap is typically egg-shaped, with a smooth, sometimes sticky surface, and ranges in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The stem is slender, often with a bulbous base, and is usually the same color as the cap. This mushroom is found in temperate forests, often growing in association with coniferous trees."
