    "intro": "Lithocardium corymbosum var. patens, commonly known as the Patens stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
