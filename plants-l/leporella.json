    "intro": "Leporella, commonly known as the small white heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. These plants are evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Leporella species typically thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in coastal or subalpine environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate floral display."
