    "intro": "Loxotrema, commonly known as the \"flowering fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants within the family Loxaglumaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a basal rosette of leaves and an erect flowering stem. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Loxotrema species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking foliage and flowers."
