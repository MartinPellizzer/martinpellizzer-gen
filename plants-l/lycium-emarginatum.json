    "intro": "Lycium emarginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and animals, though they are often avoided due to their bitter taste. Lycium emarginatum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its native habitat."
