    "intro": "Leucadendron reflexum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a South African shrub or small tree belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces showy, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Leucadendron reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
