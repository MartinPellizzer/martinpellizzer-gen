It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden in autumn before falling off. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the spring. It typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
