    "intro": "Lyonnetia montana, commonly known as the mountain lyonnetia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. Lyonnetia montana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
