    "intro": "Lycopodium jenmannii, commonly known as the Jenmann's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, which are typical features of the clubmoss family. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability. The plant's morphology reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
