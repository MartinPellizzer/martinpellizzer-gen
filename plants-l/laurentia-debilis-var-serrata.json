    "intro": "Laurentia debilis var. serrata, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration in its native range."
