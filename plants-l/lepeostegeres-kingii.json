    "intro": "Lepeostegeres kingii, commonly known as the King's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble spectral figures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
