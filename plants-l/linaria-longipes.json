    "intro": "Linaria longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its long, slender petals and unique floral structure make it an attractive addition to gardens, though it is often grown as a specialty plant. Linaria longipes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to attract pollinators."
