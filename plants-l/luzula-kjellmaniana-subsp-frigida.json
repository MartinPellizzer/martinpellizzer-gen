    "intro": "Luzula kjellmaniana subsp. frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is adapted to cool climates and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences are typical of the sedges in the Cyperaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
