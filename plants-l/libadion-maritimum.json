    "intro": "Libadion maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to maritime climates. Libadion maritimum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
