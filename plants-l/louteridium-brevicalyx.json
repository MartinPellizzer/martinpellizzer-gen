    "intro": "Louteridium brevicalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved louteridium, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
