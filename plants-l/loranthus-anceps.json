    "intro": "Loranthus anceps, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus anceps is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
