    "intro": "Lacistema poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Lacistema poeppigii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
