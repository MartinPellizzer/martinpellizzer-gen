    "intro": "Lomaresis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Lomaresis is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
