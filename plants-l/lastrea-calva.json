    "intro": "Lastrea calva, commonly known as the woolly flaxweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a creeping growth habit and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
