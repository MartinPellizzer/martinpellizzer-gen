    "intro": "Leuconotis eugeniifolia, commonly known as the Eugenia-leaved Leuconotis, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
