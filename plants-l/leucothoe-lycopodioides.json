    "intro": "Leucothoe lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping leatherleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
