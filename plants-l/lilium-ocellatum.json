    "intro": "Lilium ocellatum, commonly known as the spotted lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and feature a distinctive red or purple spot at the base of the petals. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are arranged in a fan shape around the base. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh climates, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Lilium ocellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
