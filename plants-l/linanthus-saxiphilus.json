    "intro": "Linanthus saxiphilus, commonly known as the cliff lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in rocky habitats. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in crevices and on cliffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Linanthus saxiphilus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
