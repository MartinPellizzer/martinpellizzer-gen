    "intro": "Lastrea pubirachis, commonly known as the pubescent leaf cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help to minimize water loss in arid environments. Lastrea pubirachis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
