    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. nemorosa, commonly known as woodland sweetflag, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
