    "intro": "Lemna umbonata, commonly known as the broad-leafed duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the nodes along the stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its simple structure and fast growth make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
