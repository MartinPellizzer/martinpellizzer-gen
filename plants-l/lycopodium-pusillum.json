    "intro": "Lycopodium pusillum, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and features tiny, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium pusillum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
