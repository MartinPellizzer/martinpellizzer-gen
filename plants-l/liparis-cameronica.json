    "intro": "Liparis cameronica, commonly known as the Cameron's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a short spur, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
