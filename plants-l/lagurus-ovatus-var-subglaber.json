It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems with small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is adapted to dry, rocky soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, soft-textured appearance."
