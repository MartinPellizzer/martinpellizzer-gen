    "intro": "Loxostemon purpurascens, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of red, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid, shaded environments. Its berries are an important food source for various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal."
