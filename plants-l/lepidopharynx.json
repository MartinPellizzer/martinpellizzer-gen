    "intro": "Lepidopharynx, commonly known as the scalepharynx, is a unique plant structure found in certain species of ferns. It is a specialized, scale-like pharynx that serves as a protective and functional part of the plant's reproductive system. This structure is typically located at the base of the sporangium, aiding in the release of spores. The lepidopharynx is characterized by its intricate, layered composition, which contributes to its structural strength. Its presence is an important adaptation for efficient spore dispersal in aquatic and humid environments."
