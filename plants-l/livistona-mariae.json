    "intro": "Livistona mariae, commonly known as the Marie's palm, is a species of cycad native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional Indigenous practices and have cultural significance. Livistona mariae is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
