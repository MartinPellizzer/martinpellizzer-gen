    "intro": "Laurus discolor, commonly known as the variegated laurel or spotted laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and sometimes red or purple hues. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Laurus discolor thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to gardens and botanical collections."
