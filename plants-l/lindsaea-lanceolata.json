    "intro": "Lindsaea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are lanceolate in shape, giving it its common name. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Lindsaea lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
