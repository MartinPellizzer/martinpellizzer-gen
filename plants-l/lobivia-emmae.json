    "intro": "Lobivia emmae, commonly known as the Emma's Lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the deserts of South America. It belongs to the cactus family, Cactaceae, and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lobivia emmae is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
