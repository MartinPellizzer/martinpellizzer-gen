It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance.
