    "intro": "Ledermanniella tenax, commonly known as the sticky ledermanniella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often-dry habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
