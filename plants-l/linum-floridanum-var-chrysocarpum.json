    "intro": "Linum floridanum var. chrysocarpum, commonly known as the golden-seeded flax, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the yellowish or golden seed capsules that mature in the fall, distinguishing it from other flax species. This variety is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, sandy soils."
