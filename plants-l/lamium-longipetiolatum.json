It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with hairy surfaces and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
