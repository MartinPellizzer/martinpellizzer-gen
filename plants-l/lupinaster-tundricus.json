    "intro": "Lupinaster tundricus, commonly known as the Arctic lupin, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Lupinaster tundricus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its ecosystem."
