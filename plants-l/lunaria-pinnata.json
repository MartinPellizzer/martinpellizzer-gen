    "intro": "Lunaria pinnata, commonly known as the moonflower or moonseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a unique, two-lobed silique that splits open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
