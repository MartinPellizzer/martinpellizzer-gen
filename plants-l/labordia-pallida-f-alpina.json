    "intro": "Labordia pallida f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine labordia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
