    "intro": "Lindsaea millefolium, commonly known as the feather-leaf tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture moisture from the air. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can absorb nutrients through its leaves."
