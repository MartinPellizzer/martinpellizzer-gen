    "intro": "Laphamia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lophatherum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth, often bluish-green surface. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wetlands. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to humid, temperate climates and suitable for wetland restoration projects."
