The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Lupinus benthamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
