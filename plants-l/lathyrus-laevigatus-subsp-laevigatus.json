    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in dry grasslands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
