    "intro": "Logania, commonly known as the \"false mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of about 20 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or woolly in texture. Their flowers are usually showy, with five petals and a distinctive calyx that may be showy or modified. The fruits are capsules that release seeds through a mechanism involving the splitting of the fruit wall."
