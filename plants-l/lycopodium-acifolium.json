    "intro": "Lycopodium acifolium, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia. Lycopodium acifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
