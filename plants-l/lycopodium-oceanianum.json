    "intro": "Lycopodium oceanianum, commonly known as the New Zealand clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features whorled leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium oceanianum is characterized by its primitive structure, which includes a vascular system and root-like structures called rhizomes. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
