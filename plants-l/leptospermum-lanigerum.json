    "intro": "Leptospermum lanigerum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in coastal regions."
