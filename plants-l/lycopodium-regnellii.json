    "intro": "Lycopodium regnellii, commonly known as the regnell's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact, branching stems that form dense mats. The plant produces sporophytes with spore capsules, which are typically clustered in groups of four. Lycopodium regnellii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its presence often indicates a stable, undisturbed ecosystem."
