    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. brachyodon, commonly known as the dwarf bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that features small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, bird's-foot-like leaf structure, which consists of a central stem with three small leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
