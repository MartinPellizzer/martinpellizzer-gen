    "intro": "Ligustrina fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small black berries in the fall. It is often found in moist, shady areas and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
