    "intro": "Leontodon djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura leontodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellowish, often appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
