    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lyckselensis, commonly known as the Lyckselens form of twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heaths. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. This form is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness."
