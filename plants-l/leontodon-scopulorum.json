    "intro": "Leontodon scopulorum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, enclosed in a pappus of bristles. Leontodon scopulorum is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions."
