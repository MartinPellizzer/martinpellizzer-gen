    "intro": "Lecanorchis japonica var. suginoana, commonly known as the Sugino's lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a short rhizome and produces tiny, tuberous roots that help it survive in its specialized habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
