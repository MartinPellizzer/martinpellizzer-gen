    "intro": "Lachnopylis annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily on the island of Annob\u00f3n in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Lachnaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lachnopylis annobonensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting its fragile ecosystem."
