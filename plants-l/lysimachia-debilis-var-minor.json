    "intro": "Lysimachia debilis var. minor, commonly known as lesser yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs. This species is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
