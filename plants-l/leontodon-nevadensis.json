    "intro": "Leontodon nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often at high elevations. It has small, capsule-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. Leontodon nevadensis is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine environment and is considered a rare and endemic species."
