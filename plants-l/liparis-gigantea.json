    "intro": "Liparis gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Liparis gigantea thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
