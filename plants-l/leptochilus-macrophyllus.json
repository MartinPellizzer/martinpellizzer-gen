    "intro": "Leptochilus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leafed rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
