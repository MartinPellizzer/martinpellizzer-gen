    "intro": "Lavandula canariensis subsp. hierrensis, commonly known as the Hierren\u2019s lavender, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and spikes of purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is adapted to the volcanic soils of its native habitat. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other lavenders such as its square stems and essential oil-rich leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
