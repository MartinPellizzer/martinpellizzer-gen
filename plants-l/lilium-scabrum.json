    "intro": "Lilium scabrum, commonly known as the rough lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia and China. The plant is characterized by its grayish-green, rough-textured leaves and tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. Lilium scabrum typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its bulbs are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
