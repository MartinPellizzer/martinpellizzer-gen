    "intro": "Lychnis miqueliana f. argyrata, commonly known as the silver-leaved catchfly, is a cultivated form of the species Lychnis miqueliana. It is characterized by its striking silver-white variegation on its foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its pink to red flowers. This plant is typically a herbaceous perennial, thriving in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variegated leaves make it a visually appealing addition to gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
