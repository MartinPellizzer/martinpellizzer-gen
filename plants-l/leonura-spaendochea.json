    "intro": "Leonura spaendochea, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Leonura spaendochea is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
