    "intro": "Leptocarpus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in sandy or muddy shores. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Leptocarpus humilis is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
