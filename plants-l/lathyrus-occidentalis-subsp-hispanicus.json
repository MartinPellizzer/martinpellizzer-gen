    "intro": "Lathyrus occidentalis subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, twining stems that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands."
