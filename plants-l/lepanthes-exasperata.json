    "intro": "Lepanthes exasperata, commonly known as the crimson lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a deep red or orange color with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes exasperata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
