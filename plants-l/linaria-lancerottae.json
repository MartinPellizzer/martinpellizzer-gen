    "intro": "Linaria lancerottae, commonly known as the Lancerottan toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the island of Lancerot in the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria lancerottae is adapted to the arid and rocky conditions of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and poor soil. It is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance to the local flora."
