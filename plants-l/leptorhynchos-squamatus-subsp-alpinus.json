    "intro": "Leptorhynchos squamatus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine leptorhynchos, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth form and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
