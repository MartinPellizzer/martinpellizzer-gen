    "intro": "Lagoseris caspica, commonly known as the Caspian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lagoseris caspica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
