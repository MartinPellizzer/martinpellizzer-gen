It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and robust rhizomatous growth. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, white or pale green flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
