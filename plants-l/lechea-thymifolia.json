    "intro": "Lechea thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its closely spaced, leaf-like lobes that are typically covered in a fine, powdery layer of wax. The thallus is usually light green to yellowish in color, and it often forms dense mats on tree bark, rocks, or soil. This lichen is known for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it a common indicator of air quality. Its association with thyme-like aromas comes from the presence of volatile compounds in its structure."
