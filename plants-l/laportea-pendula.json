    "intro": "Laportea pendula, commonly known as the hanging ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Laportea pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
