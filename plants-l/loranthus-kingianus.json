    "intro": "Loranthus kingianus, commonly known as the King's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its seeds are dispersed by these birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees. The plant is native to eastern Australia and is often found in coastal and rainforest regions."
