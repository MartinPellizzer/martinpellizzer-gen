    "intro": "Lespedeza japonica var. gracilis, commonly known as Japanese lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for erosion control in disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and extended blooming period."
