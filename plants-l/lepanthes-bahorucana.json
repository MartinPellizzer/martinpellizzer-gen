    "intro": "Lepanthes bahorucana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the humid environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some conservation efforts."
