    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved lithophila, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It typically grows in rocky outcrops and crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like structures. The plant has fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
