It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
