    "intro": "Lithops pseudotruncatella, commonly known as the \"dwarf ice plant,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble small stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, which are typically green with red or purple markings. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops pseudotruncatella is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
