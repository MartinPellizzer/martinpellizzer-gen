    "intro": "Leiocarpus quadrilocularis, commonly known as the four-chambered nut sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its triangular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, making it a common weed in wetland areas. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive success in moist environments."
