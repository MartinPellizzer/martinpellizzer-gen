    "intro": "Limonium scoparium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to coastal conditions. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
