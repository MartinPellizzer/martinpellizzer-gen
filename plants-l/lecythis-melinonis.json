    "intro": "Lecythis melinonis, commonly known as the Amazonian oil tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a highly prized oil used in traditional medicine and cosmetics. The tree's bark and seeds are also utilized for various purposes, including as a source of timber and food. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for numerous species and its contribution to the rainforest's biodiversity. However, due to deforestation and overharvesting, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
