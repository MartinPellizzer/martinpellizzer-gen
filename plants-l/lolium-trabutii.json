    "intro": "Lolium trabutii, commonly known as the Trabut's ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lolium trabutii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and slopes. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
