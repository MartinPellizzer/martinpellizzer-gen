    "intro": "Lonicera sovetkinae, commonly known as the Siberian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though they are usually consumed by birds rather than humans. Lonicera sovetkinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
