    "intro": "Lupinus argophyllus, commonly known as silverleaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and tall spires of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus argophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
