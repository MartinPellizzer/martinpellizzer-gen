    "intro": "Linociera cotinifolia, commonly known as the silky cotini, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
