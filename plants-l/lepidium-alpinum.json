    "intro": "Lepidium alpinum, commonly known as Alpine cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its small white or yellow flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lepidium alpinum is often used in herbal remedies and is also a food source for certain wildlife species."
