    "intro": "Lithocarpus aggregatus subsp. pseudomagneinii, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland to montane forests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
