    "intro": "Lycopodium zanclophyllum, commonly known as the Zanclophyll lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in cup-like formations called strobila. Lycopodium zanclophyllum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
