    "intro": "Laburnum vulgare var. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and resemble those of an oak tree, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and gardens. This species is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
