    "intro": "Lindsaea divaricata, commonly known as the variable lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a variegated appearance. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The plant is often found in humid, lowland forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
