    "intro": "Lastrea obliquata, commonly known as the zigzag spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that exhibit a zigzag growth pattern, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in arid environments. Lastrea obliquata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
