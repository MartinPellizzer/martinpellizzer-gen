    "intro": "Leucanthemum sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood leuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and along streambanks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with toothed margins, and its flowering stems bear white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding a central cluster of disk flowers. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can tolerate a range of soil conditions once established."
