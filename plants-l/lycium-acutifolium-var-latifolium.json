    "intro": "Lycium acutifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems with spiny branches and elliptical, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
