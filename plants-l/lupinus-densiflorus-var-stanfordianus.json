    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. stanfordianus, commonly known as Stanford's lupine, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of California and is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Its foliage consists of bipinnate leaves, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
