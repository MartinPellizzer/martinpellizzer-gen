    "intro": "Lophophytum mirabile subsp. mirabile, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, waxy, silver-white leaves with a velvety texture that shimmer in the light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
