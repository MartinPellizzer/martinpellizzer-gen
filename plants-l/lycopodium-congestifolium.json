    "intro": "Lycopodium congestifolium, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Lycopodium congestifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
