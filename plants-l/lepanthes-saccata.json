    "intro": "Lepanthes saccata, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically have a unique sac-like structure at the base of the lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes saccata prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and role in orchid diversity studies."
