    "intro": "Lindsaea macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and its ability to grow on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a soft, velvety texture. Lindsaea macrophylla is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests."
