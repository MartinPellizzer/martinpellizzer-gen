    "intro": "Lithoxylon nitidum, commonly known as the smooth lithoxyle, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, ridged bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
