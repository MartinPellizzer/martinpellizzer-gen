    "intro": "Lycoris sanguinea var. cyrtanthiflora, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to China. It features vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a subtle spider-like appearance due to its narrow petals. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulb and die back after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dramatic seasonal display and historical significance in Chinese culture."
