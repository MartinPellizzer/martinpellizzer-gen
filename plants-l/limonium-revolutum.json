    "intro": "Limonium revolutum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Limonium revolutum is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
