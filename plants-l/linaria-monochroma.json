    "intro": "Linaria monochroma, commonly known as the singleflower toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers with two lips. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Linaria monochroma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
