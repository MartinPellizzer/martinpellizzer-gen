    "intro": "Licania anisophylla, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, bark-like exodermis and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Licania anisophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
