    "intro": "Lepanthes schizix, commonly known as the split-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the genus Lepanthes, which includes over 200 species of terrestrial orchids. The plant is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Lepanthes schizix grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences."
