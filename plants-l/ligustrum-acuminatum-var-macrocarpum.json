    "intro": "Ligustrum acuminatum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited privet, is a shrub native to southern China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. The varietal name \"macrocarpum\" refers to its larger, more prominent fruit compared to the typical species."
