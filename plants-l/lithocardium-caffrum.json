    "intro": "Lithocardium caffrum, commonly known as the Cape rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fig-like fruits that are encased in a rough, green husk. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Lithocardium caffrum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
