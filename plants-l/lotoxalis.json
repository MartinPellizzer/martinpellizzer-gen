    "intro": "Lotoxalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Lotoxalis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
