    "intro": "Lindera floribunda, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. These flowers are followed by bright orange, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. Lindera floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
