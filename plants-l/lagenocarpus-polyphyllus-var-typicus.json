    "intro": "Lagenocarpus polyphyllus var. typicus, commonly known as the broad-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broad at the base and taper towards the tip. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized bracts. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
