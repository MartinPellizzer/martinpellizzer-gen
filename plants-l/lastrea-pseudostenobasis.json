    "intro": "Lastrea pseudostenobasis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and ecological benefits."
