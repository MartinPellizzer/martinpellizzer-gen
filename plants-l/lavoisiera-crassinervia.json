    "intro": "Lavoisiera crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined lavoisiera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. It produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, Lavoisiera crassinervia is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
