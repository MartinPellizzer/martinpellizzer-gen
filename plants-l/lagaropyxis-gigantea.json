    "intro": "Lagaropyxis gigantea, commonly known as the giant puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height. The plant features a rosette of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
