    "intro": "Leptospermum humifusum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air, making it a hardy species for coastal gardens. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to harsh conditions make it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
