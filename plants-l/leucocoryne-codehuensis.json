    "intro": "Leucocoryne codehuensis, commonly known as the Codehu\u00e9n lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
