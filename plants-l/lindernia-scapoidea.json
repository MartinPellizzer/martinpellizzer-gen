    "intro": "Lindernia scapoidea, commonly known as the slender lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that features delicate, linear leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions. Lindernia scapoidea is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
