    "intro": "Lannea longifoliolata, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its ability to produce clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets, and its bark is often fissured and rough in texture. It is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Lannea longifoliolata is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional African medicine."
