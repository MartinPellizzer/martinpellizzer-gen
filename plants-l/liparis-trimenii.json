    "intro": "Liparis trimenii, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption from the substrate, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Liparis trimenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
