    "intro": "Lonicera asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Lonicera asperifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
