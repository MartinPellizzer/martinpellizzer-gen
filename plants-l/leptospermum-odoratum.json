It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and along the coastlines of New South Wales and Victoria. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Leptospermum odoratum is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
