    "intro": "Lepisanthes, commonly known as the orchid bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical regions of South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Lepisanthes species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in the ecological dynamics of their native habitats."
