    "intro": "Lepisorus marginatus, commonly known as the marginate rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive marginal vein that runs along the edges of the leaflets. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
