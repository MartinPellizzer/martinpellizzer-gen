    "intro": "Lappula heterocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia. It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. Its seed pods are distinctive, splitting open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Lappula heterocarpa is an annual herb that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
