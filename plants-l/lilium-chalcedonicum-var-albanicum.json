    "intro": "Lilium chalcedonicum var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian tiger lily, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the tiger lily species. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with distinctive black spots, which are more pronounced than in the typical variety. This plant is native to the Balkan region, particularly Albania, where it thrives in mountainous and woodland habitats. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
