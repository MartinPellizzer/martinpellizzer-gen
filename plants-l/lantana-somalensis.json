    "intro": "Lantana somalensis, commonly known as Somali lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its dense, woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
