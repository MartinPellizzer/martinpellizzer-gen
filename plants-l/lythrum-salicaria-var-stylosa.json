    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria var. stylosa, commonly known as narrow-leaved rosebay, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of showy pink to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is less common than the typical rosebay but shares similar ecological roles and ornamental value."
