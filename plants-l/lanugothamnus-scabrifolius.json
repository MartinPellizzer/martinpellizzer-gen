    "intro": "Lanugothamnus scabrifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil. Lanugothamnus scabrifolius plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small animals."
