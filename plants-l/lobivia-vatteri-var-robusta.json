It features short, ribbed stems that are often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
