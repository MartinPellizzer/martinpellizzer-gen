    "intro": "Lithospermum frutescens, commonly known as red root, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are deep and fibrous, which helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. Lithospermum frutescens is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
