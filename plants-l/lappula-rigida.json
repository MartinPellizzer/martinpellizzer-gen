    "intro": "Lappula rigida, commonly known as rigid lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Lappula rigida is adapted to arid environments and has a low-growing habit that helps it conserve moisture."
