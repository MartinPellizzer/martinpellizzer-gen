    "intro": "Linaria rubioides subsp. nissana, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water. It is often found in rocky habitats and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is part of the Scrophulariaceae family, known for its showy, often tubular flowers."
