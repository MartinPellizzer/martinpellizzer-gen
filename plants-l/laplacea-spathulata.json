    "intro": "Laplacea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved laplacea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of broad, ovate to spatulate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and dry conditions. Laplacea spathulata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
