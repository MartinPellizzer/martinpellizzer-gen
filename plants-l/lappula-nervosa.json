    "intro": "Lappula nervosa, commonly known as slender lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, ribbed stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive ribbed structure, while its fruits are small, dry capsules containing several seeds. Lappula nervosa is not widely cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
