    "intro": "Leucoglossum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Leucoglossum paludosum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
