    "intro": "Larix gmelinii f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a unique form of the Siberian larch. It is characterized by its gracefully drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is a naturally occurring form that exhibits a more delicate and ornamental structure compared to the typical upright larch. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and turn gold in the autumn. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks."
