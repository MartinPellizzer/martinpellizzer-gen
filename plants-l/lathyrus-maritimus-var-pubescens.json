    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
