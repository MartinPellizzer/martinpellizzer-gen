    "intro": "Lupinus truncatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a narrow, linear shape and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Lupinus truncatus is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
