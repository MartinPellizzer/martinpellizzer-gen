    "intro": "Loroglossum brachyglotte, commonly known as the short-winged orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with short, horizontal rhizomes and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette. The orchid is notable for its compact size and unique floral structure, which contributes to its ecological niche in shaded, humid environments."
