    "intro": "Loranthus rigidilobus, commonly known as the rigid-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to a host tree, typically a eucalyptus, through a specialized root system called a haustellum. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are usually red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus rigidilobus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
