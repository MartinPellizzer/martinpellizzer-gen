    "intro": "Lathyrus bijugatus var. sandbergii, commonly known as the Sandberg's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with two pairs of leaflets and a terminal bud, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
