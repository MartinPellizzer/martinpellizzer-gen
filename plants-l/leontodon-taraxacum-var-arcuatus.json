    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. arcuatus, commonly known as the bentleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, arcuate (bent) leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical inflorescence composed of yellow ray florets. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. This variant is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology."
