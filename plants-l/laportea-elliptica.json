    "intro": "Laportea elliptica, commonly known as the broadleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Laportea elliptica is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
