    "intro": "Linum mucronatum subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in gypsum-rich environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
