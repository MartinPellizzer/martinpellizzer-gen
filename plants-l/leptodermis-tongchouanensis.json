    "intro": "Leptodermis tongchouanensis, commonly known as the Tongchouan stonecrop, is a rare succulent plant native to China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms dense mats or small clumps. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
