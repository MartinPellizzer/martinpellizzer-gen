    "intro": "Loranthus vitellinus, commonly known as the yellow or false sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish bark and small, clustered leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients from its host through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It typically grows on various host trees, including species of Eucalyptus and Acacia, in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
