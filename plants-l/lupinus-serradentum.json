    "intro": "Lupinus serradentum, commonly known as the serrated lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces spikes of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus serradentum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
