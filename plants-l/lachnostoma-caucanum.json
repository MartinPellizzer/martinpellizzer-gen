    "intro": "Lachnostoma caucanum, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a distinctive, flattened structure. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is often found growing on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subarctic regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in ecological and taxonomic studies."
