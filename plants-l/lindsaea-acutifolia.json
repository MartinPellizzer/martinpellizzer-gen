    "intro": "Lindsaea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help retain moisture. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Lindsaea acutifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
