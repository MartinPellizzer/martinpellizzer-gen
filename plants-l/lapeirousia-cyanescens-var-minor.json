It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to deep violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in the Cape Floristic Region. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, upright flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
