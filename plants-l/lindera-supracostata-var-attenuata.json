    "intro": "Lindera supracostata var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweet pepper bush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
