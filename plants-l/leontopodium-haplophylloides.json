    "intro": "Leontopodium haplophylloides, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in rocky or alpine meadows. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
