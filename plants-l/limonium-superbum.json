It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or violet flowers. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Limonium superbum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden landscapes."
