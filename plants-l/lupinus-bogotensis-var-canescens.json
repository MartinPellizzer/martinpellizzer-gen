    "intro": "Lupinus bogotensis var. canescens, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it the species name *canescens*. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to high-altitude environments. Lupinus bogotensis var. canescens is also notable for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
