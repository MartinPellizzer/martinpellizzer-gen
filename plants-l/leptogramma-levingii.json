    "intro": "Leptogramma levingii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, oval-shaped spore cases. Leptogramma levingii is native to New Zealand and is an important component of the region's native flora."
