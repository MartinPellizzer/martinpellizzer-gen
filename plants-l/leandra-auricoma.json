    "intro": "Leandra auricoma, commonly known as the golden leandra, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with gold or bronze at the edges. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive auricle-like appendage on the petals. Leandra auricoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
