It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to blue-lavender flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in horticulture and essential oil production."
