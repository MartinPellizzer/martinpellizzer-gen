    "intro": "Leptaulus oddonii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, often in response to increased humidity and rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
