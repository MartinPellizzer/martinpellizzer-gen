    "intro": "Ligusticum reptans, commonly known as the creeping cowparsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Ligusticum reptans is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
