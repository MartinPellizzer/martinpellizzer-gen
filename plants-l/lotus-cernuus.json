    "intro": "Lotus cernuus, commonly known as the drooping water-lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval and often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while its stems and leaves remain buoyant. Lotus cernuus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
