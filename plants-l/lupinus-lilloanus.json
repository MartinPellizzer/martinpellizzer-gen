It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Lupinus lilloanus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
