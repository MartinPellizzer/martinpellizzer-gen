    "intro": "Lysimachia sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia sarmentosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
