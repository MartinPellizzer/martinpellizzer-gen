It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a round, yellow-orange citrus fruit with a thick, leathery rind and a tart, acidic pulp. It is closely related to other citrus species but is less commonly cultivated for its fruit. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
