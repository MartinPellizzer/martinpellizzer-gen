    "intro": "Linaria versicolor, commonly known as the variable toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often bicolor flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance. Linaria versicolor is a popular choice for gardens due to its vibrant colors and relatively low maintenance requirements."
