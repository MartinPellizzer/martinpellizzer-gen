    "intro": "Lithocardium exaltatum, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Lithocardium exaltatum is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species in alpine conditions."
