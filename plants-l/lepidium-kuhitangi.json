    "intro": "Lepidium kuhitangi, commonly known as the Kuhitangi cress, is a rare New Zealand native plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant grows in wetland and riparian habitats, often in areas with high moisture levels. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, a feature typical of the mustard family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under New Zealand\u2019s conservation laws."
