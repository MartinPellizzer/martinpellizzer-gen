    "intro": "Larix sibirica var. tittelbachii, commonly known as the Tittelbach Siberian larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch native to the taiga regions of Siberia. It is a deciduous conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is dense and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils."
