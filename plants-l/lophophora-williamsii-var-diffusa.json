    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. diffusa, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a variant of the Peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It is characterized by its small, spineless stems and the presence of a unique, seed-containing pod that moves when disturbed. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, and is often cultivated for its medicinal and ritualistic uses. It thrives in arid conditions with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its legal status and conservation concerns, it is typically grown in controlled environments."
