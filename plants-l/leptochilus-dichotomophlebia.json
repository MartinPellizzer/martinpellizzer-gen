    "intro": "Leptochilus dichotomophlebia, commonly known as the forked vein orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive bifurcated lip, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
