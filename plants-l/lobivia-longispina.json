    "intro": "Lobivia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its spines are long and sharp, providing protection from herbivores. Lobivia longispina is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
