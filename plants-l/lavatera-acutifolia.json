It features soft, silvery-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Lavatera acutifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
