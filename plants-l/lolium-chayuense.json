    "intro": "Lolium chayuense, commonly known as Chayu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
