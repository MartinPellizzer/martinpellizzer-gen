    "intro": "Lupinus compactiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Lupinus compactiflorus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
