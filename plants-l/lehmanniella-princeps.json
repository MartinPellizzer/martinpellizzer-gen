    "intro": "Lehmanniella princeps, commonly known as the dwarf lehmanniella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
