    "intro": "Lotus persicus, commonly known as the Persian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Persia and Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive purple or red center. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in ponds and water gardens. Lotus persicus is also noted for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
