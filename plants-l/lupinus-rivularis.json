    "intro": "Lupinus rivularis, commonly known as the river lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and stream sides. The plant produces erect stems with palmately compound leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria. Lupinus rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbank soils."
