    "intro": "Lycopodiella contexta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. Lycopodiella contexta typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant evolutionary importance."
