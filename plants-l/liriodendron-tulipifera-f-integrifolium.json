    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera f. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tulip tree, is a variant of the tulip poplar native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, smooth-edged leaves that are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, tulip-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, woody, cup-like fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist, fertile habitats such as river valleys and floodplains. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
