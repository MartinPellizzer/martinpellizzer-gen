    "intro": "Lathyrus pubescens var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its \"pubescens\" and \"glaucescens\" descriptors. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
