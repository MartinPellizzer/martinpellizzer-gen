    "intro": "Leptaloe albida, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Leptaloe albida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
