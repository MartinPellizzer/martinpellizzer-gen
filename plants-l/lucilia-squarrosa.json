    "intro": "Lucilia squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy flesh fly, is a species of blow fly found in various parts of the world. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy body and metallic green or blue coloration. The plant-like appearance of its larvae, which are often found on decaying organic matter, has led to its association with certain plant environments. While not a true plant, it plays a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Its life cycle is closely tied to moist, decaying substrates, making it an important indicator of environmental conditions."
