    "intro": "Lepachys columnifera var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking ornamental species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers resembling the feathers of a flamingo. The plant produces small, green, ovate leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
