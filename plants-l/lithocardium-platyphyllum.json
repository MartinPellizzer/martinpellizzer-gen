It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
