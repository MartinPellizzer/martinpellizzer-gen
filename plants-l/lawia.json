    "intro": "Lawia, commonly known as the \"Chinese evergreen,\" is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Lawia thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to purify indoor air and its attractive foliage."
