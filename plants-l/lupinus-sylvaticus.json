    "intro": "Lupinus sylvaticus, commonly known as the woodland lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus sylvaticus is often found in woodland and meadow habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
