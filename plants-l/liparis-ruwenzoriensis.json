    "intro": "Liparis ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single spike bearing several small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist habitats at high altitudes, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
