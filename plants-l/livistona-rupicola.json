    "intro": "Livistona rupicola, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a member of the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
