    "intro": "Lagochilium schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiedea's pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, and often brightly colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats and is known for its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and a unique, rounded fruit that splits open to release seeds. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
