It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus exaltatus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
