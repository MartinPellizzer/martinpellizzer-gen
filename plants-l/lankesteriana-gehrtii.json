    "intro": "Lankesteriana gehrtii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
