    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. cuneatum, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and is often mistaken for other ryegrass species due to its similar appearance. This subspecies is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
