It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in small, glandular tubercles, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
