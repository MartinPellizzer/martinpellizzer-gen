    "intro": "Lobelia subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
