    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its bright red berries that persist into winter."
