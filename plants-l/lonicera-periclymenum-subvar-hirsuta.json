    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum subvar. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and are an important food source for birds. This subvariety is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
