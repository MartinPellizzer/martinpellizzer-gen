    "intro": "Loranthus malelensis, commonly known as the malelensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host trees. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals. Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host."
