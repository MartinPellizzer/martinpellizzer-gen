    "intro": "Lathyrus varius, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, slender pods, and the plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Lathyrus varius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil."
