    "intro": "Lachnopylis flocculosa, commonly known as the fluffball lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, woolly mats on tree trunks and branches. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored thallus, which is covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hymenium. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. It is known for its slow growth and ability to colonize bark surfaces over long periods. Lachnopylis flocculosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
