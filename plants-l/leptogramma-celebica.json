    "intro": "Leptogramma celebica, commonly known as the Celebes fern, is a species of fern native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its natural habitat."
