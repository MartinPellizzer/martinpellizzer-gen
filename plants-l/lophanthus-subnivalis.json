    "intro": "Lophanthus subnivalis, commonly known as the snow lophanthus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Lophanthus subnivalis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive."
