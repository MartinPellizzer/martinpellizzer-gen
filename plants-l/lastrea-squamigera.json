    "intro": "Lastrea squamigera, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters at the base of the stems, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Lastrea squamigera is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
