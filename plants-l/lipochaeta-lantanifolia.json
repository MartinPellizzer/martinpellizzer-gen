    "intro": "Lipochaeta lantanifolia, commonly known as the coastal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and it is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Lipochaeta lantanifolia is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional African medicine."
