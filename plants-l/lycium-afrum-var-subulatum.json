    "intro": "Lycium afrum var. subulatum, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
