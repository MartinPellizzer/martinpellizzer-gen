It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal spikes, which give it its common name. Leptomeria pungens is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
