    "intro": "Lasiocoma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, velvety leaves that give them their common name. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats. Lasiocoma species are annual or perennial herbs, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pale in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain parts of the world."
