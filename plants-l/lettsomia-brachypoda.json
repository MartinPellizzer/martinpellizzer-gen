It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with a few leaves, and its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
