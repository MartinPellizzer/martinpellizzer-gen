    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha var. hualfinensis, commonly known as the Hualf\u00edn lobivia, is a rare and striking succulent native to the Andes of Argentina. It features vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its blue-green foliage. The plant has a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted succulents. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and somewhat challenging plant for cultivation."
