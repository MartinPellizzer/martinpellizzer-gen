It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, and often bi-colored flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.
