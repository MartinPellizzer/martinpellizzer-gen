    "intro": "Lilium nanum f. flavidum, commonly known as the yellow dwarf lily, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the lily family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that range in color from pale yellow to golden orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of delicate, cup-shaped blossoms. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
