    "intro": "Lastrea nivalis, commonly known as the snow lastrea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are densely packed, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lastrea nivalis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
