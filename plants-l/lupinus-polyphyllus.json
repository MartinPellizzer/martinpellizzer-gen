    "intro": "Lupinus polyphyllus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fluffy, silver-blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and open woodlands. Lupinus polyphyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
