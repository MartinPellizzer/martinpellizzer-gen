It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stem is upright and supports the showy inflorescence.
