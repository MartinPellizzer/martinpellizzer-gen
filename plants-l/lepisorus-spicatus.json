    "intro": "Lepisorus spicatus, commonly known as the spicate polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus spicatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, moist soils."
