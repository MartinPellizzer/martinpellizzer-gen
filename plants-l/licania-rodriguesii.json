    "intro": "Licania rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Licania rodriguesii is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
