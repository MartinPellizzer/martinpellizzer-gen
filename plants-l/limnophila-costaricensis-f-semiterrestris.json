    "intro": "Limnophila costaricensis f. semiterrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial form of the water primrose, is a variant of this aquatic plant that exhibits a semi-terrestrial growth habit. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially exposed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. This form is less commonly cultivated than its fully aquatic counterpart but is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
