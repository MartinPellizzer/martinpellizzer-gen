    "intro": "Lobularia rupestris, commonly known as the rock lobularia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
