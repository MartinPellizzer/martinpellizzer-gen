    "intro": "Leiphaimos obconica, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. These flowers bloom in late summer and are attractively visited by bees and other pollinators. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, dry environments."
