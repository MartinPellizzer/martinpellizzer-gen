    "intro": "Linnaea borealis var. sulphurescens, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to the northern regions of North America and northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which are more intensely colored than those of the typical Linnaea borealis. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and rocky stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is notable for its unique floral coloration, which may serve as an adaptation for pollination by specific insects."
