    "intro": "Luzula calabra, commonly known as the slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming clumps or tufts. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of its native habitats."
