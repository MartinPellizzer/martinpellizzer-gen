    "intro": "Loranthus longitubus, commonly known as the long-tube mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to a host tree through its roots, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grows on the branches of broadleaf trees. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
