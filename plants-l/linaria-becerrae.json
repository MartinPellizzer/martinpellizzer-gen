    "intro": "Linaria becerrae, commonly known as the Bercer\u00e1 linaria, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Linaria becerrae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
