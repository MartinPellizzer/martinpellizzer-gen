    "intro": "Liparis tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its inflorescence produces clusters of small, colorful blossoms. Due to habitat loss, Liparis tonkinensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
