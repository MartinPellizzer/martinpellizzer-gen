    "intro": "Lectandra, commonly known as meadow thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe and western Asia. The plants are characterized by their tall, spiny stems and composite flower heads that typically feature yellow disk flowers surrounded by blue or purple ray florets. Lectandra species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
