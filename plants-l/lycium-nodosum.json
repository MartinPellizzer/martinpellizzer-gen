    "intro": "Lycium nodosum, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Lycium nodosum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
