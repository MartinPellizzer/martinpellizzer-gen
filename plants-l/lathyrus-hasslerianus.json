    "intro": "Lathyrus hasslerianus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with a deep violet hue and produces striking pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Lathyrus hasslerianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
