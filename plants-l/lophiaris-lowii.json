    "intro": "Lophiaris lowii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Lophiaris lowii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
