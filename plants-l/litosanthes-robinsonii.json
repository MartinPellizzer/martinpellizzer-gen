    "intro": "Litosanthes robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves and a single, tall flowering stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale, puffball-like seed heads. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Litosanthes robinsonii is often found in dune environments and is considered a rare and endemic species."
