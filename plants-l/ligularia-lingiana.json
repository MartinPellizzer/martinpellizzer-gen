It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead base, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
