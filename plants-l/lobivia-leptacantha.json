It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mounding growth habit. The plant features short, cylindrical stems covered in sparse, pale greenish-gray spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from areoles along the stems. Lobivia leptacantha is well adapted to drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
