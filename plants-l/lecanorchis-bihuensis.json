    "intro": "Lecanorchis bihuensis, commonly known as the Bihu orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small stature and specialized floral structure make it a unique subject of botanical study. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
