    "intro": "Leptalix lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leptalix, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
