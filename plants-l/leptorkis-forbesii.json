    "intro": "Leptorkis forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Leptorkis forbesii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
