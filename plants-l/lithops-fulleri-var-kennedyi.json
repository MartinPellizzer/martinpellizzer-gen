    "intro": "Lithops fulleri var. kennedyi, commonly known as the \"dune lithops,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
