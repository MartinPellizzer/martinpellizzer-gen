It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers in the shape of a spurred tail, which is characteristic of the Linaria genus. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
