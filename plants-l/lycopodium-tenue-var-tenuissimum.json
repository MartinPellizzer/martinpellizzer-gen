    "intro": "Lycopodium tenue var. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are closely arranged along its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. Its sporophylls are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the stems, which are characteristic of the Lycopodiaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its particularly slender leaves compared to other members of the species."
