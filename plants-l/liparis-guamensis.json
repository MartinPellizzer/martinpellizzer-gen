    "intro": "Liparis guamensis, commonly known as the Guam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Guam in the Mariana archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It has a unique rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Liparis guamensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
