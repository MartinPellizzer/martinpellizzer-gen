    "intro": "Leucothoe organensis, commonly known as the Florida beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces showy, berry-like fruits that turn a striking violet-purple color in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Leucothoe organensis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
