    "intro": "Laportea latilanceolata, commonly known as broad-leaved laceflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of the invasive species Mikania micrantha. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Laportea latilanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
