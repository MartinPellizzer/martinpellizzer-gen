    "intro": "Lysimachia ophelioides, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, narrow, and usually hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia ophelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to spread through rhizomes."
