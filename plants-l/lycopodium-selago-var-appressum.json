    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. appressum, commonly known as the ground huckleberry, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with upright, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Its fronds are linear and often have a slightly curled appearance, contributing to its distinctive look. This variety is closely related to other Lycopodium species and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
