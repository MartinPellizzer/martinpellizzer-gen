    "intro": "Lupinus lignipes, commonly known as the redstem lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Lupinus lignipes is part of the legume family, which allows it to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
