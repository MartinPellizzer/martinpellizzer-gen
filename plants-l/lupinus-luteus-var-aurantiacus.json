    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. aurantiacus, commonly known as the golden lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its growth habit is typically upright, with stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The golden lupine is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting other plant life."
