    "intro": "Limeum mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique lime moss, is a species of liverwort found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Ptilidiorrhizaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a simple thalloid structure with a green, photosynthetic surface covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or decaying wood. Limeum mossambicense plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
