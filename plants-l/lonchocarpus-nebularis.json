    "intro": "Lonchocarpus nebularis, commonly known as the cloud bean or sky bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, and it produces distinctive, elongated pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to the toxicity of its seeds, it is often avoided for cultivation and used primarily in ornamental or ecological contexts."
