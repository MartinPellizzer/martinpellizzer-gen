    "intro": "Lamprotis selaginifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Lamprotis selaginifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
