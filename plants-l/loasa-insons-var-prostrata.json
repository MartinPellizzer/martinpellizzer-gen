    "intro": "Loasa insons var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate loasa, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its sprawling, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
