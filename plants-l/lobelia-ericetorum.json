    "intro": "Lobelia ericetorum, commonly known as the heather lobelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and arranged in a compact, heath-like manner. Lobelia ericetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
