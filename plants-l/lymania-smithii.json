It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
