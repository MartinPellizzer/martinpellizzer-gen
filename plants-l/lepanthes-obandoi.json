    "intro": "Lepanthes obandoi, commonly known as the Obando\u2019s orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, specifically found in Costa Rica and Panama. This species is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of purple and white hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
