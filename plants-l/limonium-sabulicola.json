    "intro": "Limonium sabulicola, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal ecosystems. Limonium sabulicola is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
