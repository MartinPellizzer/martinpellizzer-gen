    "intro": "Legousia balearica, commonly known as the Balearic legousia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, herbaceous stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
