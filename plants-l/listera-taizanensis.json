    "intro": "Listera taizanensis, commonly known as the Taizan violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, often with a slight pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listera taizanensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
