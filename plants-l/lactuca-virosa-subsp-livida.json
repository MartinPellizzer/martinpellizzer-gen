    "intro": "Lactuca virosa subsp. livida, commonly known as the purple leaf lettuce, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowering stems bear small, yellow composite flowers. It is notable for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
