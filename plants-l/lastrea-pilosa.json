    "intro": "Lastrea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which further aid in minimizing water evaporation. Lastrea pilosa is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
