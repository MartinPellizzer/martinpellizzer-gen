    "intro": "Lemboglossum majale, commonly known as the giant lemboglossum, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces striking purple or red inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and provide insulation. Lemboglossum majale is often found in cloud forests and is considered an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
