    "intro": "Lellingeria delitescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming briefly during the summer months before withering. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Lellingeria delitescens is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
