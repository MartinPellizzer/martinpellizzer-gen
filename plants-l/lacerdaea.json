    "intro": "Lacerdaea, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Lacerdaea species are often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They are popular in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
