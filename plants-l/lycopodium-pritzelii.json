    "intro": "Lycopodium pritzelii, commonly known as the Pritzel's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Lycopodium pritzelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
