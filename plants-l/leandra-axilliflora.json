    "intro": "Leandra axilliflora, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Leandra axilliflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
