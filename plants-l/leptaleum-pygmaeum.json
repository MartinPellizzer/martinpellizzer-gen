    "intro": "Leptaleum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf leavened plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
