    "intro": "Luehea alternifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has alternate, oblong leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
