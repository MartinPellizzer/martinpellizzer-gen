    "intro": "Lathyrus lacaitae, commonly known as the Kashmir bean or Himalayan vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain elongated, edible seeds, which are rich in protein but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Lathyrus lacaitae is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its ecological significance includes providing forage for livestock and serving as a source of traditional food in certain regions."
