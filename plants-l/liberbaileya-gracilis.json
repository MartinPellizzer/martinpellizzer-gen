It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that grow in a cascading pattern, making it an attractive addition to shaded gardens or indoor spaces. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Liberbaileya gracilis prefers moist, well-draining soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for humid environments."
