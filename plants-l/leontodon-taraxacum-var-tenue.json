    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. tenue, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hollow stem that bears a flower head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
