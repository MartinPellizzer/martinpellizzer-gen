    "intro": "Lycaste macrophylla subsp. xanthocheila, commonly known as the yellow-veined lycaste, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with yellow veins contrasting against a predominantly white or pale pink background. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in varying environmental conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its vibrant floral displays."
