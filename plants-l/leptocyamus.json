    "intro": "Leptocyamus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Leptocyamus plants typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often with a rounded or spreading form. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds."
