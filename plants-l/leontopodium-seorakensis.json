    "intro": "Leontopodium seorakensis, commonly known as the Korean edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered."
