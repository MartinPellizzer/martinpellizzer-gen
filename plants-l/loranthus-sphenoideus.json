    "intro": "Loranthus sphenoideus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
