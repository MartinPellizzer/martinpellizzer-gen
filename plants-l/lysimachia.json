These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. They typically have opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy or glandular. Lysimachia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Many species are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
