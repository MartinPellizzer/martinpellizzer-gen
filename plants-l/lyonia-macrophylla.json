    "intro": "Lyonia macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its small, oval leaves remain green throughout the year, providing year-round interest, while its clusters of delicate flowers bloom in late spring. Lyonia macrophylla is also valued for its ability to support local wildlife, including bees and butterflies."
