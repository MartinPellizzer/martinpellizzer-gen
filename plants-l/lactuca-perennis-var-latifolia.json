    "intro": "Lactuca perennis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf lettuce, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are often curly or loosely lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by slender, ribbed seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
