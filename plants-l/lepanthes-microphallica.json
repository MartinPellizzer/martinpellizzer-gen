    "intro": "Lepanthes microphallica, commonly known as the miniature slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green with a distinctive, slipper-shaped labellum. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Lepanthes microphallica is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and rarity in cultivation."
