    "intro": "Lindsaea parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It exhibits a unique parasitic relationship with certain tree species, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, scale-like leaves that help it cling to its host. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
