    "intro": "Lonicera hispidula var. subspicata, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though not commonly consumed by humans. This species is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, and it serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
