It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Lonicera macrophylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
