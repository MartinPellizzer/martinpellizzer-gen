    "intro": "Lebidiera malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spherical seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
