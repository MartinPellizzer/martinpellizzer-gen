    "intro": "Lycopodium sieberianum, commonly known as the Sieber's clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium sieberianum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
