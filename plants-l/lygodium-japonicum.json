    "intro": "Lygodium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a climbing fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a water lily. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
