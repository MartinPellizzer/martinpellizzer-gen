    "intro": "Lomatium andrusianum, commonly known as Townsend's lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and meadows. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal purposes, though its use is less common compared to other lomatium species. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
