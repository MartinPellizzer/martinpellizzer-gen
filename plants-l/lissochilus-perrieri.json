It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, lip-shaped petals and are often pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
