    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba f. quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed sweet pepper tree, is a variant of the sweet pepper tree native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves with five lobes, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
