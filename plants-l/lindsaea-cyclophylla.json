    "intro": "Lindsaea cyclophylla, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a dense network of veins that provide structural support. Lindsaea cyclophylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and offering habitat for small organisms."
