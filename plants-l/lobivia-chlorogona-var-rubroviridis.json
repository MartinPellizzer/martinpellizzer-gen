    "intro": "Lobivia chlorogona var. rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-green lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, rounded rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or pinkish hues along the edges. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens or succulent collections. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice among cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
