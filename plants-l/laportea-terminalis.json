    "intro": "Laportea terminalis, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea terminalis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
