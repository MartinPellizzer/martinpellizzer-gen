    "intro": "Lilium sarniense, commonly known as the Sarnian lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and bear the showy blooms. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for preserving this botanical gem."
