    "intro": "Leucophyllum alejandrae, commonly known as the Alejandra's flowering shrub, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen structure and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Leucophyllum alejandrae is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
