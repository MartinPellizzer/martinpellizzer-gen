    "intro": "Leptactina epinyctios, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, silvery foliage. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
