    "intro": "Lapathum rivale, commonly known as water woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. The plant has slender stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Lapathum rivale is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
