    "intro": "Leucothamnus montanus, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant's resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
