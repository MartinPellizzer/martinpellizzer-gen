    "intro": "Litobrochia altissima, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with poor nutrient content. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for studying plant resilience in extreme climates."
