    "intro": "Lygodium meyenianum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like structures that resemble ferns, though it is not a true fern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium meyenianum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other humid habitats across tropical and subtropical regions."
