    "intro": "Lepyrodiclis paniculata, commonly known as the panicled waterwheel, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are often submerged or floating. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Lepyrodiclis paniculata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
