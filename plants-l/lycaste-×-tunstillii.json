    "intro": "Lycaste \u00d7 tunstillii, commonly known as the hybrid lycaste orchid, is a rare and fascinating hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lycaste meleagris and Lycaste lutea. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure, typical of many orchid genera, and features elongated, fleshy rhizomes that support its growth. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
