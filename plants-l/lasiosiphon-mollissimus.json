It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive silky texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
