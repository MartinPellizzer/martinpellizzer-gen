    "intro": "Loxospermum, commonly known as prairie smoke, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery seed heads that resemble smoke, which give the plant its common name. These plants are typically found in prairie and grassland habitats across North America. Loxospermum species are herbaceous perennials with showy, often violet or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. They play an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native environments."
