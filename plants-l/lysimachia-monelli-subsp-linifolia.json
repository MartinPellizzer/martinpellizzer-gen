    "intro": "Lysimachia monelli subsp. linifolia, commonly known as golden thread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
