    "intro": "Leandra mosenii, commonly known as the Mosenii orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leandra mosenii is considered a conservation concern."
