    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive variegated pattern of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and cheerful, long-lasting blooms."
