    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems that produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lathyrus laevigatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
