    "intro": "Lithocardium corymbosum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf rock corymb, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
