    "intro": "Lantana urticoides var. hispidula, commonly known as the rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, hairy, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and roots make it an invasive species in some regions."
