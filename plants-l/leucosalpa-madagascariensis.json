It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
