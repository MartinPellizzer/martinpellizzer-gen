    "intro": "Loranthus nummulariifolius, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree for water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found growing on the branches of angiosperms such as oaks and elms. Its parasitic nature and ornamental appearance make it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed in forestry."
