    "intro": "Larbrea uliginosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in dense clusters, adapted to waterlogged soils. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in traditional medicine."
