    "intro": "Lyonia truncata var. truncata, commonly known as the dwarf lyonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
