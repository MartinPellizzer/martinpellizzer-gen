    "intro": "Lamium purpureum var. hybridum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and along woodland paths. It is characterized by its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
