    "intro": "Lilium speciosum album-novum, commonly known as the white novelty lily, is a rare and ornamental species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge at the base, which bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stem is sturdy and erect. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
