    "intro": "Loliola pratensis, commonly known as the meadow loliola, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps, which disperse via wind. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with rich, moist soil and partial shade."
