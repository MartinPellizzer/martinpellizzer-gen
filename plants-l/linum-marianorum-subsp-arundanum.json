    "intro": "Linum marianorum subsp. arundanum, commonly known as the marsh flax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, slightly hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it an important species for stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
