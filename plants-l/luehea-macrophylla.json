    "intro": "Luehea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or giant swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is often cultivated for its starchy corms, which are used in traditional cuisines."
