    "intro": "Loranthus tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to the islands of French Polynesia and is an important part of the local ecosystem."
