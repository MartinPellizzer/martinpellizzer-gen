    "intro": "Lycopodioides welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and upright growth habit. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its primitive vascular plant lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
