    "intro": "Livistona boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin palm, is a species of palm native to the Bonin Islands. It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by black, spherical fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
