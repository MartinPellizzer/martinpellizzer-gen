    "intro": "Lycium longitubum, commonly known as the Chinese wolfberry or goji berry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Russia. It is characterized by its spiny stems, small yellow flowers, and red to orange berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its berries are harvested when fully ripe and are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a nutritious food supplement. Lycium longitubum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
