    "intro": "Lathyrus venetus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of pale blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
