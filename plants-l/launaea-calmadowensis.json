    "intro": "Launaea calmadowensis, commonly known as the Calmadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant is typically shrub-like, with gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea calmadowensis is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
