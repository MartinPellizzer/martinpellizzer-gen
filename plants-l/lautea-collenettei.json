    "intro": "Lautea collenettei, commonly known as the Collenette's lautea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Lautea collenettei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
