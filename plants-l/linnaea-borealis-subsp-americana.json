    "intro": "Linnaea borealis subsp. americana, commonly known as American twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs on the ends of its stems. The plant has elliptic, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. This subspecies is closely related to the European Linnaea borealis and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
