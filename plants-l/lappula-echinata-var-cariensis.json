    "intro": "Lappula echinata var. cariensis, commonly known as the Carpathian lappula, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose the small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, while its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. This variant is notable for its ecological adaptation to arid environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
