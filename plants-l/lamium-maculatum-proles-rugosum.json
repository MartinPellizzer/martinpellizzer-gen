It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish mottling, and its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
