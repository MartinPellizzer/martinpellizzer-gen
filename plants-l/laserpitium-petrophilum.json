    "intro": "Laserpitium petrophilum, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and slender, hairy stems. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing in meadows and slopes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Laserpitium petrophilum is an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
