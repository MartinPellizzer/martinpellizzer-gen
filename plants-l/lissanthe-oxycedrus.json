    "intro": "Lissanthe oxycedrus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It features long, narrow leaves that are often described as having a grass-like appearance, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils. Lissanthe oxycedrus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its aromatic properties have also made it historically significant in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
