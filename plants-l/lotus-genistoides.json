    "intro": "Lotus genistoides, commonly known as the yellow lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Lotus genistoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
