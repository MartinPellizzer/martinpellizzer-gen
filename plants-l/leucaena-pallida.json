    "intro": "Leucaena pallida, commonly known as white leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and trifoliate leaves that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Leucaena pallida is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
