    "intro": "Lotus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lotus rigidus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
