It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems. Lyginia excelsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
