    "intro": "Lachnostoma aymardii, commonly known as the Aymard's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinct, granular texture. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, particularly in South America. It lacks true leaves but has a flattened, leaf-like structure called a cortex. This species is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
