It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a distinctive, ligulate inflorescence. Ligularia narynensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
