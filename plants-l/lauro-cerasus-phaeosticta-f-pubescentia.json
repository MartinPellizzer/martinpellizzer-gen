    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus phaeosticta f. pubescentia, commonly known as the hairy cherry laurel, is a hybrid plant that combines traits of Prunus laurocerasus and Prunus cerasifera. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
