    "intro": "Lupinus tayacajensis, commonly known as the Tayacaja lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus tayacajensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
