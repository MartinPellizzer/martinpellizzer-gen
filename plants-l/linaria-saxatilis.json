    "intro": "Linaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Linaria saxatilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal cliffs, gravelly slopes, and disturbed habitats."
