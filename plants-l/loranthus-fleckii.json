    "intro": "Loranthus fleckii, commonly known as the Fleck's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus fleckii is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments."
