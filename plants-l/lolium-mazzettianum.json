    "intro": "Lolium mazzettianum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in forage and turfgrass mixtures. Lolium mazzettianum is also an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and high seed production."
