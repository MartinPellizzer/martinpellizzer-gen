    "intro": "Leptospermum erubescens var. strictum, commonly known as the red bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red floral spikes, which are composed of numerous stamen clusters that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a contrast to the vibrant red flowers. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
