    "intro": "Lindsaea seemannii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like structures, which contribute to its unique appearance. Lindsaea seemannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
