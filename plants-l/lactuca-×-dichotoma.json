    "intro": "Lactuca \u00d7 dichotoma, commonly known as the wild lettuce, is a hybrid plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its latex sap contains compounds that have been used historically for their mild sedative properties."
