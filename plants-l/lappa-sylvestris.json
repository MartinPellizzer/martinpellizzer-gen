    "intro": "Lappa sylvestris, commonly known as the wild hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Lappa sylvestris is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges."
