    "intro": "Loranthus engleri, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Loranthus engleri plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for birds and other animals."
