    "intro": "Lepismium pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the\u841d\u85e6\u79d1 (Asclepiadaceae) family. Native to the Andean regions of South America, it is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is a climbing vine with tuberous roots, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lepismium pittieri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
