    "intro": "Liparis epiphytica subsp. pentagonalis, commonly known as the pentagonal orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
