    "intro": "Leontodon pitardii, commonly known as the Pitard's toothbrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
