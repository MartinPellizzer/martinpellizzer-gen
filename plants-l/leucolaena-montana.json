    "intro": "Leucolaena montana, commonly known as mountain leucolaena, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Leucolaena montana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
