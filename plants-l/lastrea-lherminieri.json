    "intro": "Lastrea lherminieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
