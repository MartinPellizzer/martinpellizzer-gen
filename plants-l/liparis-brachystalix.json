    "intro": "Liparis brachystalix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its dense, spike-like inflorescence of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature common in the Orchidaceae family. Liparis brachystalix is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming colonies in suitable habitats."
