    "intro": "Loranthus vulgaris, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds, which aid in seed dispersal. This evergreen plant is often associated with holiday traditions and has cultural significance in various regions."
