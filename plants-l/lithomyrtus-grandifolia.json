    "intro": "Lithomyrtus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. These flowers are followed by small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. Lithomyrtus grandifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
