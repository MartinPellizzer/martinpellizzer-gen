    "intro": "Lasiacis oaxacensis var. maxonii, commonly known as the Oaxaca mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
