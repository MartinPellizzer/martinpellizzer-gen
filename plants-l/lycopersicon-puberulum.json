    "intro": "Lycopersicon puberulum, commonly known as the hairy tomato, is a species of nightshade plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Despite its small size, it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects and animals."
