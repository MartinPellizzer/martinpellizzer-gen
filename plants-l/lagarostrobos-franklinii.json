    "intro": "Lagarostrobos franklinii, commonly known as the Franklin's pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the wet forests of Tasmania. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same tree. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones that mature over several years. Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered one of the most endangered tree species in the world."
