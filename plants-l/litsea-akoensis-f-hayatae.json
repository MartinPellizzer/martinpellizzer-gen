    "intro": "Litsea akoensis f. hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's litsea, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Litsea genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens to a reddish color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species within the Lauraceae family."
