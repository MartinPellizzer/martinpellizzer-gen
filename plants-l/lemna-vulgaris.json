    "intro": "Lemna vulgaris, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, rosette-shaped leaves that are less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Watermeal reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic animals."
