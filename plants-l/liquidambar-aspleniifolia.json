    "intro": "Liquidambar aspleniifolia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
