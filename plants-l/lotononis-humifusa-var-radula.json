    "intro": "Lotononis humifusa var. radula, commonly known as the coastal lotononis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
