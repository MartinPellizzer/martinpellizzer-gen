    "intro": "Lithraea montana, commonly known as the mountain lithraea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are generally simple and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Lithraea montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
