    "intro": "Lophira macrophylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The wood of Lophira macrophylla is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
