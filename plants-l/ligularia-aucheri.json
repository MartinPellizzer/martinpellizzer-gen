    "intro": "Ligularia aucheri, commonly known as the giant dock, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens."
