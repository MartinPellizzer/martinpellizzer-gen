    "intro": "Lupinus cochapatensis, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus cochapatensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
