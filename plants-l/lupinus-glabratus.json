    "intro": "Lupinus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of spiny, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus glabratus is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil fertility."
