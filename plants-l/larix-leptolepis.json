    "intro": "Larix leptolepis, commonly known as Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is light, soft, and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and crafts. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
