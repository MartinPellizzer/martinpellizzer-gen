It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed enclosed in a hard, bony shell. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellowish or greenish coloration. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
