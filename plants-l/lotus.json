    "intro": "Lotus, commonly known as the sacred water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features showy, waterborne flowers that bloom in a wide range of colors, including pink, red, and white. The lotus has a unique ability to float on water surfaces while its roots are submerged in mud, a trait that makes it highly adaptable to various aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine across Asia. The plant is also symbolically significant in many cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
