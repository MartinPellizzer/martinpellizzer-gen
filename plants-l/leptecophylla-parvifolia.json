    "intro": "Leptecophylla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved leptecophylla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
