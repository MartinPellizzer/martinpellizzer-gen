It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
