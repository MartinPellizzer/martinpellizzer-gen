    "intro": "Lass sidifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, hair-like trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lass sidifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for both medicinal and horticultural use."
