It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Locellaria species are known for their rapid growth and short life cycle, often completing their life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
