    "intro": "Lachnaea sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive rounded thallus structure. It typically grows on bark and wood surfaces in temperate forest environments. The plant's morphology is characterized by its dense, tightly packed lobes and a leathery texture. It is often found in shaded, moist habitats where it forms symbiotic relationships with algae. The species is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it an indicator of stable ecological conditions."
