    "intro": "Lavoisiera mucorifera var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lavoisiera, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araliaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and adaptability to humid, tropical environments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its small, elliptical leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
