    "intro": "Lindsaea linduensis, commonly known as the Lindu fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea linduensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
