    "intro": "Livistona mariae subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western mariae palm, is a species of palm native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same inflorescence. The fruit is a smooth, black drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
