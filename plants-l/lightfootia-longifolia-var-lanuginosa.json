It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in moist woodland or understorey habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
