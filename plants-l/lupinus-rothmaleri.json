    "intro": "Lupinus rothmaleri, commonly known as the Rothmaler's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus rothmaleri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
