    "intro": "Leucospermum zwartbergense, commonly known as the Zwartberg firecracker, is a striking South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its bright orange to red, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. Native to the Western Cape, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
