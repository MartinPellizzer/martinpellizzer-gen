    "intro": "Lomatium farinosum var. hambleniae, commonly known as the Hamblin's lomatium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
