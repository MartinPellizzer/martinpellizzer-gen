It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy, fringed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
