    "intro": "Lupinus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and tall spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its growth habit is typically upright, with woody stems that become more prominent with age. Lupinus macrophyllus is often found in dry, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
