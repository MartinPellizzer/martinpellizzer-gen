    "intro": "Lysimachia quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angle plant or golden thread, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, silky hairs. Lysimachia quinquangularis is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
