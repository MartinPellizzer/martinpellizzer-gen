    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. praecox, commonly known as early wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is more closely related to sedges. This variant is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and panicles of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often a mix of grass-like leaves and narrower, more cylindrical stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
