    "intro": "Lotus rechingeri, commonly known as the Kashmiri lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its flowers are known for their fragrance and are often used in traditional medicine and floral arrangements. Due to its limited habitat and environmental threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
