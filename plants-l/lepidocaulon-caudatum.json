    "intro": "Lepidocaulon caudatum, commonly known as the slender lepidocaulon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
