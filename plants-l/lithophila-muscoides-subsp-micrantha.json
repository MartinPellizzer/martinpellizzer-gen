    "intro": "Lithophila muscoides subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in open, sunny habitats, where it forms dense mats or cushions. The plant has a compact, leafy structure with a short, horizontal rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a lip that is often spurred and adapted for pollination by specific insects. This subspecies is noted for its resilience in harsh environments and is an important component of its local ecosystem."
