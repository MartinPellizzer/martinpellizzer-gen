    "intro": "Lindera triloba, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Lindera triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
