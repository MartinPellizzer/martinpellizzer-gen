    "intro": "Lithocardium perrottetii, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and fragrant, white flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. Lithocardium perrottetii is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
