    "intro": "Loasa dyeri, commonly known as the mountain mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its flowering period attracts various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Loasa dyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
