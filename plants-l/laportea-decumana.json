    "intro": "Laportea decumana, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Laportea decumana is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
