It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive violet or purple throat. It produces small, lens-shaped legumes that mature into brown pods. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
