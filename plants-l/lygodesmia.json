    "intro": "Lygodesmia, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Lygodesmia species are herbaceous, with some varieties forming dense mats on the ground. Their botanical features make them suitable for use in ornamental gardening and as ground cover in humid climates."
