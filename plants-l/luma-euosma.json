It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which provides a striking contrast to its dark, rugged bark. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by distinctive, lantern-shaped fruits. Luma euosma thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and horticulture."
