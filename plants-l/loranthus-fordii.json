    "intro": "Loranthus fordii, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood or Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through animal consumption."
