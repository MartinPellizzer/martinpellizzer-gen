    "intro": "Lobelia convolvulacea, commonly known as the creeping lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs. Lobelia convolvulacea is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woods and along stream banks."
