    "intro": "Lactuca oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant features upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lactuca oblongifolia is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
