    "intro": "Licania vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's licania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
