It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, ribbed seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linaria tunetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
