It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.
