It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
