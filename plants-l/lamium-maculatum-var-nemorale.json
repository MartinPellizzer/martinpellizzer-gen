    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. nemorale, commonly known as the spotted deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive purple or reddish markings, and its flowers are typically pale pink or white, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a desirable ground cover and a potential weed."
