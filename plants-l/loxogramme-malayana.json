    "intro": "Loxogramme malayana, commonly known as the Malay water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Loxogramme malayana plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
