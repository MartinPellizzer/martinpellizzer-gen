It is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that typically measure less than a centimeter in diameter. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces numerous small, clustered pseudobulbs. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid air. Lepanthes miniflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and rarity in cultivation."
