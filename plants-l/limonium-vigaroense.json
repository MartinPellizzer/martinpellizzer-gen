    "intro": "Limonium vigaroense, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and silver-white, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. Limonium vigaroense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions."
