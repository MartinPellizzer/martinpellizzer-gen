    "intro": "Ligusticum scopulorum, commonly known as mountain lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its aromatic leaves and roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum scopulorum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
