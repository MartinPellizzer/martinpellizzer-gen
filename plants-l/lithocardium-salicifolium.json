    "intro": "Lithocardium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Lithocardium salicifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
