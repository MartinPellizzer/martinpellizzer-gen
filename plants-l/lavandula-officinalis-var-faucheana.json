It is characterized by its aromatic, spike-like inflorescences of purple to pink flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy, perfumery, and traditional medicine."
