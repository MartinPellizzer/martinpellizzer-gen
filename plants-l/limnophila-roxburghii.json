    "intro": "Limnophila roxburghii, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, herbaceous growth habit and is often found in wetland environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. Limnophila roxburghii is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
