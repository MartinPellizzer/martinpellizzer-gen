    "intro": "Lobivia scoparia, commonly known as the rock lobster cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Lobivia scoparia is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun and minimal rainfall."
