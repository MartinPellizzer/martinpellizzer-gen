    "intro": "Lacistema weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's lacistema, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
