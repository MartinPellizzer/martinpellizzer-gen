    "intro": "Loxogramme wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and streams, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it in the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Loxogramme wallichiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
