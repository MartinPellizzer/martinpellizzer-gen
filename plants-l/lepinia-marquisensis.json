It belongs to the family Lepihammelaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to habitat loss, Lepinia marquisensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
