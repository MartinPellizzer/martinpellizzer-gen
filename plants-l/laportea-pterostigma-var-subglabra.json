    "intro": "Laportea pterostigma var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes true nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to hybridize with other Laportea species, contributing to its variability in morphology."
