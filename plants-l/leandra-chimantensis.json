    "intro": "Leandra chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 leandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually large and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Leandra chimantensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
