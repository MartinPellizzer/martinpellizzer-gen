It features a compact, low-growing form with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are rich in iridoid glycosides, making it valuable in traditional medicine. Lithospermum sewerzowii is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
