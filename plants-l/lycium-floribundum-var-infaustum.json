    "intro": "Lycium floribundum var. infaustum, commonly known as the black-fruited lycium, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, dark purple to black berries that are highly ornamental. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its berries are edible but have a tart, slightly bitter flavor, and the plant is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in gardens. Lycium floribundum var. infaustum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
