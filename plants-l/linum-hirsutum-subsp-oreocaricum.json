It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Linum hirsutum subsp. oreocaricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
