    "intro": "Lepanthes cercopetala, commonly known as the red-faced orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red and yellow floral markings, which are particularly prominent on the lip of the flower. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are small but highly ornate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes cercopetala is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
