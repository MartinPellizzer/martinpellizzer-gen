    "intro": "Listrostachys imbricata, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
