    "intro": "Leichhardtia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed leichhardtia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
