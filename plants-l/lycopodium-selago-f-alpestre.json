    "intro": "Lycopodium selago f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its small, compact stature and possesses sporophylls that bear spores in specialized structures called sporangia. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, erect stem and closely packed, needle-like leaves. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, where it tolerates cold and harsh conditions. This fern ally is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
