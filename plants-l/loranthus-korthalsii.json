    "intro": "Loranthus korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Loranthus korthalsii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
