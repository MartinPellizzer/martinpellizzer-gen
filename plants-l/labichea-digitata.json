It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes resembling fingers, hence its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
