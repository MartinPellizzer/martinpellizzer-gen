    "intro": "Leucanthemum anomalum, commonly known as the starry groundsel, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, daisy-like flowers, which consist of white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc of tubular flowers. Leucanthemum anomalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
