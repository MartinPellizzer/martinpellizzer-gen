    "intro": "Lepanthes edwardsii, commonly known as the Edwards' slipper orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, spurred flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, or red. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, such as moths, due to their strong scent and nectar-rich structure. Lepanthes edwardsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
