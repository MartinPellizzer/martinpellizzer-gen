    "intro": "Linosyris frisea, commonly known as the frisea lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Linosyris frisea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
