    "intro": "Leptonychia chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited daphne, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are orange to red in color, which are edible but often have a mild, sweet taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
