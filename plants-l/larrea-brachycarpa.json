    "intro": "Larrea brachycarpa, commonly known as poor man's pepper, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and woody, spine-like stems. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, with adaptations such as small leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. It produces small, reddish fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Larrea brachycarpa is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
