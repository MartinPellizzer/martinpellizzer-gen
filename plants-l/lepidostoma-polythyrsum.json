    "intro": "Lepidostoma polythyrsum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lepidostoma polythyrsum is considered a vulnerable species."
