It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
