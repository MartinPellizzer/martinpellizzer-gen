It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating water retention in its natural habitat. Lepanthes turialvae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
