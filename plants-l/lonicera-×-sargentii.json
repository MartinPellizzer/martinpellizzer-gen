    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant also bears small, red berries that are edible for birds. Lonicera \u00d7 sargentii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
