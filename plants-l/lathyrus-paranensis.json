    "intro": "Lathyrus paranensis, commonly known as the Paran\u00e1 vetch, is a perennial climbing legume native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has small, elongated pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus paranensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
