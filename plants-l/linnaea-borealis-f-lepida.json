    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lepida, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a member of the family Gamopetalaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in pairs on slender stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. This variant, f. lepida, is distinguished by its smaller, more densely clustered flowers compared to the typical form."
