    "intro": "Lobelia rhynchopetalum subsp. callosomarginata, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is typically found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range."
