    "intro": "Lyonia nipensis, commonly known as the Japanese lyonia, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas. Lyonia nipensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
