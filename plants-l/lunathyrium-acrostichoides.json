    "intro": "Lunathyrium acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lunathyrium acrostichoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
