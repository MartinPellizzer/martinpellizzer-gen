    "intro": "Limnanthemum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered water primrose, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern with floating or submerged leaves that are often oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in the axils of the leaves, giving it its common name. Limnanthemum capitatum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
