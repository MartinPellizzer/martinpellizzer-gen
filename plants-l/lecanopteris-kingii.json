    "intro": "Lecanopteris kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
