    "intro": "Limonium erythrorrhizum var. eriocalyx, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces spikes of small, brightly colored flowers, typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils, contributing to its ecological importance in dune ecosystems. The species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
