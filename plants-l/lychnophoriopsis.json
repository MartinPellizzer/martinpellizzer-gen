    "intro": "Lychnophoriopsis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often display a striking silver or pale green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lychnophoriopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
