    "intro": "Lycopodium nitens, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium nitens typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
