    "intro": "Lupinus apricus, commonly known as the early lupin, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Lupinus apricus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
