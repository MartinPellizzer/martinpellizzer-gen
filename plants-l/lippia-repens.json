    "intro": "Lippia repens, commonly known as creeping lippia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Lippia repens is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
