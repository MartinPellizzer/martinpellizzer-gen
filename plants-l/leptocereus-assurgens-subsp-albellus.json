    "intro": "Leptocereus assurgens subsp. albellus, commonly known as the White-Flowered Organ Pipe Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, often attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. This subspecies is notable for its striking appearance and ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
