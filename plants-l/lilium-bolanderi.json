    "intro": "Lilium bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are long and narrow, forming a basal rosette, and it produces bulbous roots that help it store nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
