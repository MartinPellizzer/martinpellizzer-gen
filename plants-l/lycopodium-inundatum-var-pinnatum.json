    "intro": "Lycopodium inundatum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a relic from the prehistoric era, showcasing primitive plant features."
