    "intro": "Leopoldia abortiva, commonly known as the dwarf leopoldia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. It produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
