    "intro": "Lupinus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Lupinus parviflorus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
