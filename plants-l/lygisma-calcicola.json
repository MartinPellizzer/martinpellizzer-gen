It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Lygisma calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for arid ecosystems."
