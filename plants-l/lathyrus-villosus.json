    "intro": "Lathyrus villosus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus villosus is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. It is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop or forage."
