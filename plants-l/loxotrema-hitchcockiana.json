    "intro": "Loxotrema hitchcockiana, commonly known as the Hitchcock's lichen, is a species of crustose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-yellow thallus with a granular texture and distinct, irregularly arranged isidia. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is often found in California and other parts of the western United States. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
