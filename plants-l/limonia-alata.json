    "intro": "Limonia alata, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has thick, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Limonia alata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
