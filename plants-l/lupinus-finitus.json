    "intro": "Lupinus finitus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus finitus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
