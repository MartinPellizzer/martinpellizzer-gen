    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris f. peloria, commonly known as the \"peloric foxglove,\" is a variant of the common toadflax. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, where the typical two-lipped flowers are replaced by a single, large, bell-shaped corolla. This mutation results from a genetic anomaly that affects the development of floral parts. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
