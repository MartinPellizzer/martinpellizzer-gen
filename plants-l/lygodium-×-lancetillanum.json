    "intro": "Lygodium \u00d7 lancetillanum, commonly known as the hybrid climbing fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lygodium microphyllum and Lygodium japonicum. It is characterized by its long, wiry rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread rapidly through dense vegetation. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which contribute to its invasive potential in suitable habitats. Its foliage is typically dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a problematic species in tropical and subtropical regions."
