    "intro": "Lappula minima, commonly known as the lesser lappula, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are contained in a beak-like capsule, which aids in dispersal by wind. Lappula minima is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
