    "intro": "Lolium distachyum, commonly known as two-rowed grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, giving it its common name. It is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth. Lolium distachyum is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
