    "intro": "Lomoplis ceratonia, commonly known as the carob tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The tree produces long, woody pods that contain sweet, sticky seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. These pods are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum. The carob tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and for its role in soil stabilization."
