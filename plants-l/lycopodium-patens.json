    "intro": "Lycopodium patens, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems that produce clusters of tiny, spore-bearing cones. The plant has scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, and it lacks true roots, instead having rhizomes that help it spread. Lycopodium patens is typically found in temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its spores are released in spring and contribute to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
