    "intro": "Liparis gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer, featuring a unique combination of white and green hues. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its growth is closely tied to specific microhabitats, often found on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Liparis gjellerupii is considered a vulnerable species."
