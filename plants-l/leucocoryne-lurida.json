It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought. Leucocoryne lurida is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
