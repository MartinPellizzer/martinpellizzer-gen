    "intro": "Lomariopsis latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved lomariopsis, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Lomariopsis latiuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
