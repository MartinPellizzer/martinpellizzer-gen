    "intro": "Lythrum pemphis, commonly known as narrowleaf lythrum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lythraceae family, which includes other species such as the common lythrum. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soils. It produces spikes of bright red or pink flowers that bloom from June to September. Its slender, lance-shaped leaves are a distinguishing feature, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
