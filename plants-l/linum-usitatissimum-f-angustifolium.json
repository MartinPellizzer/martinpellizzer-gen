    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved flax, is a variant of the common flax plant. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical flax. This form is often cultivated for its fibrous stalks, which are used in the production of linen. The flowers are usually blue or white and bloom in early summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
