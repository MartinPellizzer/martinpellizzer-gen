    "intro": "Lycium megistocarpum var. ovatum, commonly known as the large-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible when fully ripe, though they are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
