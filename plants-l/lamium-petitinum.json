    "intro": "Lamium petitinum, commonly known as spring dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale purple or reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact. Lamium petitinum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
