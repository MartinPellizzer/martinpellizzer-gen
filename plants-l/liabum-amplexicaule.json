    "intro": "Liabum amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping liabum, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it the species name *amplexicaule*, meaning \"clasping.\" The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
