    "intro": "Lupinus leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Lupinus leonensis has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
