    "intro": "Lepanthes astraea, commonly known as the Astraea orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes astraea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
