    "intro": "Lophocarpus, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other structures. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a veiny texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in spadices. Lophocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. These plants are often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
