    "intro": "Levisticum paludapifolium, commonly known as marsh parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are rich in volatile oils, giving it a distinctive aromatic quality. Due to its preference for moist environments, it is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams."
