    "intro": "Lupinus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Lupinus tenuifolius is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
