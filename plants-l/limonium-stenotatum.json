    "intro": "Limonium stenotatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Limonium stenotatum is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
