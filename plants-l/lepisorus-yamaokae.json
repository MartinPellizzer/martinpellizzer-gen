    "intro": "Lepisorus yamaokae, commonly known as the Yamaoka's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lepisorus yamaokae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
