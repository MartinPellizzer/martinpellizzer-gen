    "intro": "Lycopodium concinnum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of pine needles. The plant produces small, club-shaped spore cones that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Lycopodium concinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in natural habitats."
