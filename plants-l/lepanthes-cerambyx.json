    "intro": "Lepanthes cerambyx, commonly known as the Cerambyx orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short, stocky rhizome and a few broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
