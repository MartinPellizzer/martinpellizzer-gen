    "intro": "Lomatia obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomatia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Lomatia obliqua is also known for its fragrant leaves, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
