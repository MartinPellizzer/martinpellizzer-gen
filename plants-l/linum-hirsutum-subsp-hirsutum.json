    "intro": "Linum hirsutum subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its fibrous stems and seeds have been historically used for fiber and oil production, though it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes today."
