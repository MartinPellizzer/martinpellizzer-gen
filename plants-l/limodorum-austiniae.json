    "intro": "Limodorum austiniae, commonly known as the Austin's lily or the purple lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is slender and supports the single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limodorum austiniae is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
