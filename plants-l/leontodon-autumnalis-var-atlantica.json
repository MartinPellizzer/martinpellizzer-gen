    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic autumn dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along sea cliffs and dunes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the autumn. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
