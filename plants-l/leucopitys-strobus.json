    "intro": "Leucopitys strobus, commonly known as the white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thick, scaly, and often fissured, providing a distinctive texture. The white cedar is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and traditional crafts."
