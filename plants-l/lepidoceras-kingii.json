    "intro": "Lepidoceras kingii, commonly known as the King's lepidoceras, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
