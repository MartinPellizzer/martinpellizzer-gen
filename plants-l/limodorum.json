    "intro": "Limodorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often translucent leaves and striking, showy flowers that resemble those of orchids. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Limodorum is often considered a symbol of botanical mystery and conservation importance."
