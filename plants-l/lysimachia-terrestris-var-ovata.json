    "intro": "Lysimachia terrestris var. ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
