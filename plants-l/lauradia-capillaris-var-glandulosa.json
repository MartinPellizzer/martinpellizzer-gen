    "intro": "Lauradia capillaris var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in minute glandular hairs, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and stream banks."
