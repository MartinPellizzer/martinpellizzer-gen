It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Lepanthopsis hyalina is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
