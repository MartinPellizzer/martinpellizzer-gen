    "intro": "Lomaria columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
