    "intro": "Lycium halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Lycium halophilum is highly tolerant of high salinity and can thrive in soils with low fertility. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage makes it ecologically and agriculturally significant in dry regions."
