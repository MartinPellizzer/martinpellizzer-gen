    "intro": "Liparia splendens, commonly known as the shining lipara, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
