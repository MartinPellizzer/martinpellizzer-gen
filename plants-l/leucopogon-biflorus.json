    "intro": "Leucopogon biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters of two, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the salty and windy coastal environment. It is often found in heathlands and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
