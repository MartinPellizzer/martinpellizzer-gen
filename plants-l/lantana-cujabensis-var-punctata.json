    "intro": "Lantana cujabensis var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted lantana, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly serrated edge and often bear small, dark spots, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
