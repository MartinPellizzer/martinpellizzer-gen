    "intro": "Lingelsheimia capillipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a pale yellow to greenish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator species for air quality."
