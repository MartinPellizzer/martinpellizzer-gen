    "intro": "Limonium palmare, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plumbagaceae family. It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often forming dense clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Limonium palmare is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
