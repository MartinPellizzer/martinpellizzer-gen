    "intro": "Lysima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in saline soils. Lysima's compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
