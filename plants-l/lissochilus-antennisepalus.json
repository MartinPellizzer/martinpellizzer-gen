    "intro": "Lissochilus antennisepalus, commonly known as the hairy-armed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy appendages on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
