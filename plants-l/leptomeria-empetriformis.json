    "intro": "Leptomeria empetriformis, commonly known as the rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
