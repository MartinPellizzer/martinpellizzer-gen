    "intro": "Lamium tuberiferum, commonly known as the tuberous dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive downy underside and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its underground tubers, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lamium tuberiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
