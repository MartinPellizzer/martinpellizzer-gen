    "intro": "Lavigeria macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heavy, spirally twisted shell that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its association with certain ornamental plants in some regions. However, it is not a true plant but a member of the family Achatinidae. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a significant agricultural pest in many areas."
