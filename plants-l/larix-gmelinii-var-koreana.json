    "intro": "Larix gmelinii var. koreana, commonly known as Korean larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that mature to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn before shedding, contributing to the seasonal beauty of its habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
