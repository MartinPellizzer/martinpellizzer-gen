    "intro": "Larix communis, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from most other conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against environmental stress. The European larch is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
