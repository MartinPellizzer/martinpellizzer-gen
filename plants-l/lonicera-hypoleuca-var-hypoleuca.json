    "intro": "Lonicera hypoleuca var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soil, making it a common sight in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for native gardens."
