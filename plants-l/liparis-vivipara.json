    "intro": "Liparis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, as it gives birth to live offspring in the form of plantlets that grow directly from the mother plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Liparis vivipara is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
