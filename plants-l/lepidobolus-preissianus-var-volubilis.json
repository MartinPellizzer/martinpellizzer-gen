    "intro": "Lepidobolus preissianus var. volubilis, commonly known as the climbing lepidobolus, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white to yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly encountered plant in its native range."
