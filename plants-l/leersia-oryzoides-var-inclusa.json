It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
