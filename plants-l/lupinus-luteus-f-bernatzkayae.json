    "intro": "Lupinus luteus f. bernatzkayae, commonly known as the Bernatzky's yellow lupine, is a variant of the yellow lupin, characterized by its distinctive floral and foliar features. It is a perennial legume native to the western United States, particularly California, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are hairy and gray-green in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
