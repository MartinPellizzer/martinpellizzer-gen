    "intro": "Lupinus yanahuancensis, commonly known as the Yanahu\u00e1n lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Lupinus yanahuancensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation."
