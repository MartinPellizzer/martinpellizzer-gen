    "intro": "Lotus salvagensis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Lotus salvagensis is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
