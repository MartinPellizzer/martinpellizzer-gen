    "intro": "Limonium loganicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are adapted to coastal environments, making it drought-tolerant and salt-resistant. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the plant. Limonium loganicum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils."
