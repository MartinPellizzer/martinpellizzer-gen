    "intro": "Lepanthes hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy lepanthus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green to orange hue. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes hirsutula is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
