    "intro": "Limonium sucronicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or saline soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limonium sucronicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal climates."
