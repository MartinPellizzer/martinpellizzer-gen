    "intro": "Linaria modesta, commonly known as the modest toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Linaria modesta has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a relatively short-lived perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
