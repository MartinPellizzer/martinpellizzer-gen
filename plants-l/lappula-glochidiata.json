    "intro": "Lappula glochidiata, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, bristle-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Lappula glochidiata is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
