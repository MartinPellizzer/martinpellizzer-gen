    "intro": "Linociera leprocarpa var. courtallensis, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a rare and valuable tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly sought after for its fragrance and durability. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered in some regions."
