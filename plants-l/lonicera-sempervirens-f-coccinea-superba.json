    "intro": "Lonicera sempervirens f. coccinea-superba, commonly known as the scarlet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
