    "intro": "Lepanthes condorensis, commonly known as the Condor orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in montane cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and showy, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepanthes condorensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
