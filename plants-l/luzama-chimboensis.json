    "intro": "Luzama chimboensis, commonly known as the Chimbo mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinct yellow or red center. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
