    "intro": "Lomandra micrantha subsp. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate lomandra, is a perennial, evergreen herb native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming low, mat-like structures. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in spring. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
