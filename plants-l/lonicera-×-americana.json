    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 americana, commonly known as American honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Lonicera \u00d7 americana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
