    "intro": "Lepanthes ova-rajae, commonly known as the Royal Egg Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, egg-shaped pseudobulbs and strikingly colorful flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the understory. Its flowers, which range in color from white to deep purple, are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes ova-rajae is considered a conservation concern."
