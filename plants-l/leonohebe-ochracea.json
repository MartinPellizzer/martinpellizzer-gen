    "intro": "Leonohebe ochracea, commonly known as the golden hebe, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in New Zealand and other temperate regions."
