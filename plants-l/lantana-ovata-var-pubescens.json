    "intro": "Lantana ovata var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in many areas."
