    "intro": "Listrostachys, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving the plant a delicate appearance. Listrostachys species often produce small, pea-like flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, and they are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. These plants are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
