    "intro": "Liparis clareae, commonly known as the Clarea Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
