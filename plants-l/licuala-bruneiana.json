    "intro": "Licuala bruneiana, commonly known as the Borneo palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is a large, herbaceous plant with a tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the top of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that is a fibrous, spiny capsule. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
