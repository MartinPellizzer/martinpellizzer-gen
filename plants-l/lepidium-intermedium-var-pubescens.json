    "intro": "Lepidium intermedium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cress, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are elongated siliques that contain several small seeds. This variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance and aids in moisture retention."
