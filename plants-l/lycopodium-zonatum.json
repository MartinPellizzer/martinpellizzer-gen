    "intro": "Lycopodium zonatum, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. Lycopodium zonatum is often found in rocky soils and forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the habitat. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are typically located at the tips of its branches."
