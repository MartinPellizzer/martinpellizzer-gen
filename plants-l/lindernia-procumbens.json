    "intro": "Lindernia procumbens, commonly known as the carpet bugloss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and blue, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lindernia procumbens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
