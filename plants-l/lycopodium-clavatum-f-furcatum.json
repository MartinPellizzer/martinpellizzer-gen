    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss species characterized by its distinctive, branched stems. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant's foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stems. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. This fern-like plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
