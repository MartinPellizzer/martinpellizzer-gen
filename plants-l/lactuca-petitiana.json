    "intro": "Lactuca petitiana, commonly known as the small lettuce or Petitian lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Lactuca petitiana is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it prefers moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
