It features opposite, broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, violet, or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it an ecologically valuable plant."
