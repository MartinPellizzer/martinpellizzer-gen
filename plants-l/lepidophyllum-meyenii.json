    "intro": "Lepidophyllum meyenii, commonly known as the Mexican snowball or yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its native habitat."
