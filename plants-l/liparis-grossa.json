    "intro": "Liparis grossa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Liparis grossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
