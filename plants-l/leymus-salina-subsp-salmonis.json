    "intro": "Leymus salina subsp. salmonis, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions. The plant typically grows in dense, low mats, often forming a dominant vegetation type in salt marshes and dunes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal regions. This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
