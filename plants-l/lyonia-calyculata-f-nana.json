    "intro": "Lyonia calyculata f. nana, commonly known as dwarf lyonia, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form a dense ground cover in garden settings."
