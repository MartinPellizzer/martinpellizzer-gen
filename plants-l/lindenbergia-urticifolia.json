    "intro": "Lindenbergia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lindenbergia urticifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
