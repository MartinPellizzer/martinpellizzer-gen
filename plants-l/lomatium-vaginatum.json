It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its root system is extensive and valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Lomatium vaginatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows."
