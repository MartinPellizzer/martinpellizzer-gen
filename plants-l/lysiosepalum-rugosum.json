    "intro": "Lysiosepalum rugosum, commonly known as the rough leathery cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Lysiosepalum rugosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
