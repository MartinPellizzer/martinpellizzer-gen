    "intro": "Lycopodium filicaule, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, club-shaped spore cones rather than flowers, which are typically found at the base of its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, forming a mat-like structure on the forest floor. Lycopodium filicaule is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas."
