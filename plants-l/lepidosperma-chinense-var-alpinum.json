    "intro": "Lepidosperma chinense var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth form and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
