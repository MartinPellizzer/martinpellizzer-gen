    "intro": "Leontodon collinum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a smooth, entire margin, which distinguishes it from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
