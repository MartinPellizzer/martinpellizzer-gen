    "intro": "Lobelia maculata, commonly known as the spotted lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lobelia maculata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
