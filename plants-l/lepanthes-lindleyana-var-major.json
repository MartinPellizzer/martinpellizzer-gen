    "intro": "Lepanthes lindleyana var. major, commonly known as the giant white orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This variety is distinguished by its large, showy white flowers that often have a subtle purple or pink tinge at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic touch to its natural habitat."
