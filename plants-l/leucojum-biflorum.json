    "intro": "Leucojum biflorum, commonly known as the white squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its bulbs are toxic, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Leucojum biflorum is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and early blooming habit."
