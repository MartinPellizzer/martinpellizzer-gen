    "intro": "Ludwigia sphaerocarpa var. jungens, commonly known as the red-leaf Ludwigia, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange foliage, which becomes more intense under strong lighting conditions. This variety thrives in moderately to heavily planted aquariums and prefers warm, soft water with good current. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for foreground or midground planting in freshwater setups. It also produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge above the water surface."
