    "intro": "Lipoblepharis asperrima, commonly known as the rough-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are typically thick and succulent, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The species is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor environment."
