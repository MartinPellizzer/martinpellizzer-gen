    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. echinata, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a species of cacti native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and the southwest United States. It is characterized by its short, spineless stems that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it is known for containing the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
