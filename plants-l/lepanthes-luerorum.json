    "intro": "Lepanthes luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms during the wet season. Lepanthes luerorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
