    "intro": "Loranthus verruculosus, commonly known as the rough mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. Loranthus verruculosus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
