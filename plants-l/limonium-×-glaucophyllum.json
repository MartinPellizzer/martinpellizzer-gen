    "intro": "Limonium \u00d7 glaucophyllum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and coastal landscaping. Limonium \u00d7 glaucophyllum is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in sandy habitats."
