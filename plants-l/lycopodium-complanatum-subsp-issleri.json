    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subsp. issleri, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and clustered, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
