    "intro": "Lophiolepis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Lophiolepis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions across its native range."
