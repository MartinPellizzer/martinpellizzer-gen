    "intro": "Linaria chalepensis var. chalepensis, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native environments."
