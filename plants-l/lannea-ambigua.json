    "intro": "Lannea ambigua, commonly known as the African bristle-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Lannea ambigua is also valued for its potential medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
