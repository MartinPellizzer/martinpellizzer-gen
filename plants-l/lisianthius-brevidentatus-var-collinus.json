    "intro": "Lisianthius brevidentatus var. collinus, commonly known as the mountain lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often found in rocky or open habitats at higher elevations. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
