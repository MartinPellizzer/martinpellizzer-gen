    "intro": "Lilium neilgherrense, commonly known as the Neelgherrenser lily, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
