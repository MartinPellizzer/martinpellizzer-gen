    "intro": "Lesquerella alpina, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help it survive in harsh alpine environments. Lesquerella alpina produces seeds that contain valuable oils, which have been studied for their potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Its growth is typically limited to rocky soils and high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
