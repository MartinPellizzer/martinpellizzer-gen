    "intro": "Lupinus bracteolaris, commonly known as the bracteolaris lupine, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, leaf-like bracts at the base of each flower cluster, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus bracteolaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
