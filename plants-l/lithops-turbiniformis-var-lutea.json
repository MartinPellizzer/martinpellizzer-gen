    "intro": "Lithops turbiniformis var. lutea, commonly known as the Yellow Stone Lithops, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, paired leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a collector's plant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
