    "intro": "Lachemilla schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's mossy stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
