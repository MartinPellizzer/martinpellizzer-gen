    "intro": "Leucanthemum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk, giving it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes. It has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and produces small, showy flowers from late spring to early summer. Leucanthemum subalpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils."
