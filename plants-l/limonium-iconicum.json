It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along dunes and rocky shores. Limonium iconicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden landscapes."
