    "intro": "Lysimachia nummularia subf. longipes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in wet or semi-shaded areas."
