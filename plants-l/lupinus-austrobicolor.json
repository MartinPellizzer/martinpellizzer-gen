    "intro": "Lupinus austrobicolor, commonly known as the Two-Colored Lupin, is a perennial legume native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking two-toned flowers, which typically feature a white or pale pink upper petal and a deeper blue or purple lower petal. The plant has narrow, fern-like leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. Lupinus austrobicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
