    "intro": "Lavoisiera nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined lavoisiera, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
