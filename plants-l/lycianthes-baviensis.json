    "intro": "Lycianthes baviensis, commonly known as the Bavi nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for agricultural use but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
