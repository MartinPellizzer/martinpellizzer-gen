It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of bell-shaped, yellowish-green flowers. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect life. It is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
