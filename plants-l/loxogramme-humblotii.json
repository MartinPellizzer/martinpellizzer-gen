    "intro": "Loxogramme humblotii, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are delicate and trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. It is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to purify water."
