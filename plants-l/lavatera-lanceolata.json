    "intro": "Lavatera lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf woollypod, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, fluffy white or pink flowers. The plant produces follicles that are covered in a dense, woolly layer, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Lavatera lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
