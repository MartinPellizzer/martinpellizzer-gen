    "intro": "Loranthus martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
