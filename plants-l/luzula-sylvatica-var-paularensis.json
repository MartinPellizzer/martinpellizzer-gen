It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
