    "intro": "Lindernia hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Lindernia hirsuta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
