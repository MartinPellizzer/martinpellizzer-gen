    "intro": "Lippia longifolia, commonly known as Mexican mint or honey mint, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its essential oils, particularly menthol and limonene, contribute to its distinct minty fragrance and medicinal properties. Lippia longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its digestive and antiseptic benefits."
