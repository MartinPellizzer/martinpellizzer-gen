    "intro": "Lepanthes scoliosa, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes scoliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
