    "intro": "Lepisorus ensatus, commonly known as the horned fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Lepisorus ensatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
