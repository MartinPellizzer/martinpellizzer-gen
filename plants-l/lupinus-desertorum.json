    "intro": "Lupinus desertorum, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus desertorum is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
