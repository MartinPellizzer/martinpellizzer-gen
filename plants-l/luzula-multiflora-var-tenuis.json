It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its slender foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic value."
