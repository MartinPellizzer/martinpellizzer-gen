    "intro": "Lepidium botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botchantzev's cress, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the cress genus."
