    "intro": "Limnochloa plantaginea, commonly known as the swamp grass or water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in marshy areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Limnochloa plantaginea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
