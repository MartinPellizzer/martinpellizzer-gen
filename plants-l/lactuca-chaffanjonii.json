    "intro": "Lactuca chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its delicate, rosette-forming leaves and small, yellow flower heads that bloom in the summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. The plant has a long, fibrous root system and is typically short-lived, completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
