    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. preslianum, commonly known as the Preslia's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form compact clusters. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures containing spores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and spore reproduction make it an important component of certain ecological systems."
