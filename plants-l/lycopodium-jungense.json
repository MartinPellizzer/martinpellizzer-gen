    "intro": "Lycopodium jungense, commonly known as the Jung's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium jungense is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical and ecological importance."
