    "intro": "Lindsaea orbiculata var. tenera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are typically found in the shade of trees in humid environments. It thrives in warm, moist conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique appearance and growth habit make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and terrariums."
