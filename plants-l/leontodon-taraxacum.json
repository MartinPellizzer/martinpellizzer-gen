    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar puffy seed heads known as \"dandelion clocks.\" The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas."
