    "intro": "Leymus littoralis, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Leymus littoralis plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
