It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates.
