    "intro": "Lonicera laceana, commonly known as the lace honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lonicera laceana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
