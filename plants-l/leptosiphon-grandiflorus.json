    "intro": "Leptosiphon grandiflorus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
