    "intro": "Lingoum tinctorium, commonly known as the dye plant or woad, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its blue flowers and distinctive heart-shaped leaves. Historically, it was cultivated for its leaves, which contain a blue pigment used in dyeing textiles. Its botanical significance lies in its role in early dye production and its genetic relationship to modern cruciferous vegetables."
