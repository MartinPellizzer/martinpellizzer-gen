    "intro": "Litostigma, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants typically have hairy stems and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Litostigma species are often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where they adapt to harsh climatic conditions. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
