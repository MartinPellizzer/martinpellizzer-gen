    "intro": "Lonicera flexuosa, commonly known as the trailing honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, flexible stems that trail along the ground or climb supports, often forming dense mats. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Lonicera flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
