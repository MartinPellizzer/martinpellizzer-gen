    "intro": "Lilium japonicum var. alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra Lily, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy, trumpet-shaped blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in the wild."
