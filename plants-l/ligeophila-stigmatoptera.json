    "intro": "Ligeophila stigmatoptera, commonly known as the spotted leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on the underside. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, known as spathes, enclose the spadix, which produces both male and female flowers."
