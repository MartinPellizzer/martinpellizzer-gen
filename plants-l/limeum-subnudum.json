    "intro": "Limeum subnudum, commonly known as the nakedleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a pale green to yellowish thallus and a leathery texture. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having a flattened, lobed structure that absorbs nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Limeum subnudum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
