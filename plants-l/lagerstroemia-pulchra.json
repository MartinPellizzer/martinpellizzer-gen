It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals layers of pink and white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Lagerstroemia pulchra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
