    "intro": "Leymus europaeus, commonly known as European wild rye, is a perennial grass native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. Leymus europaeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
