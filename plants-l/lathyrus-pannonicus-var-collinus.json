    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus var. collinus, commonly known as the Hungarian vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in traditional agriculture."
