    "intro": "Lilaeopsis carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Lilaeopsis carolinensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
