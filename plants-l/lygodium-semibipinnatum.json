    "intro": "Lygodium semibipinnatum, commonly known as the semi-bipinnate water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its complex, feathery fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. The spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
