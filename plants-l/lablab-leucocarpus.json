    "intro": "Lablab leucocarpus, commonly known as the white carpus bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing edible, white seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a food crop in its native regions."
