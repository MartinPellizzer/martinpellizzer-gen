    "intro": "Lamium cyrneum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive purple underside, and its flowers are small, two-lipped, and typically violet or purple in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Lamium cyrneum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
