    "intro": "Lomaria dentata, commonly known as the toothed lomaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural gardens, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
