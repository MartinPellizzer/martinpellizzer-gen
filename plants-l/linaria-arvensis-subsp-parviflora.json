    "intro": "Linaria arvensis subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in disturbed or open habitats."
