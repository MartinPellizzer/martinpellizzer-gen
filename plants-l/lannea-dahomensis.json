    "intro": "Lannea dahomensis, commonly known as the West African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clustered, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lannea dahomensis is considered vulnerable to extinction."
