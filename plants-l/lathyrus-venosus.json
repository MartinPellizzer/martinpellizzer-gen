    "intro": "Lathyrus venosus, commonly known as the veiny pea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus venosus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
