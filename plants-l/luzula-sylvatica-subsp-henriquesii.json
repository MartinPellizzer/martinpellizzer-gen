    "intro": "Luzula sylvatica subsp. henriquesii, commonly known as the Portuguese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
