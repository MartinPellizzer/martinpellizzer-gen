    "intro": "Lepanthes detecta, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a common feature in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows on tree roots or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lepanthes detecta is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
