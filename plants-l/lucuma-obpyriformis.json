    "intro": "Lucuma obpyriformis, commonly known as the golden fruit or lucuma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, egg-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The fruit has a unique, sweet, and nutty flavor, often described as a combination of maple syrup and roasted nuts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh Andean conditions and its role in traditional Andean agriculture."
