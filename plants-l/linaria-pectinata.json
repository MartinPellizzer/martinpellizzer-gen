    "intro": "Linaria pectinata, commonly known as the woolly toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Linaria pectinata is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
