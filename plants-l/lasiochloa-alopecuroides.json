    "intro": "Lasiochloa alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of pale green to brownish florets, which are wind-pollinated. Lasiochloa alopecuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
