    "intro": "Lonicera dumosa, commonly known as the trailing honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lonicera dumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover trellises or ground cover."
