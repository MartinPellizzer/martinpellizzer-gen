    "intro": "Lantana antillana, commonly known as the West Indian lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Lantana antillana is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can be invasive in some regions."
