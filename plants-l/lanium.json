    "intro": "Lanium, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellowwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Lanium species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to withstand arid conditions. They are also valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for tool-making and construction."
