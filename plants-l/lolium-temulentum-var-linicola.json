    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. linicola, commonly known as red brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its reddish stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three small florets. Red brome is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
