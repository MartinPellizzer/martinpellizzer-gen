    "intro": "Leontodon caucasicus var. jailae, commonly known as the Caucasian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by a crown of bracts and a pappus of hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
