    "intro": "Leochilus tricuspidatus, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three distinct lobes on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
