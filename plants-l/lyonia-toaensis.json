It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Lyonia toaensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
