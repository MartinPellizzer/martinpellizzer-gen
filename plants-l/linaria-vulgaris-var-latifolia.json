    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a trailing habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small trumpets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds."
