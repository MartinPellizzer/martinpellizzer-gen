    "intro": "Lophanthus anisatus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lophanthus anisatus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in high-altitude ecosystems."
