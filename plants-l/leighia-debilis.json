    "intro": "Leighia debilis, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leighia debilis is considered a threatened species in its native range."
