    "intro": "Lophiolepis lobelii, commonly known as the Cape York lily, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or near watercourses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
