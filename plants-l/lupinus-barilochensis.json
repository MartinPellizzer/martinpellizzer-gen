    "intro": "Lupinus barilochensis, commonly known as the Bariloch lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
