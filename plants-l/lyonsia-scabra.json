    "intro": "Lyonsia scabra, commonly known as the rough lyonsia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, rough-textured foliage that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Lyonsia scabra is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
