    "intro": "Luzula spicata subsp. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of white to pale green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
