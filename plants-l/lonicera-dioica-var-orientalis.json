    "intro": "Lonicera dioica var. orientalis, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow with orange markings, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. While it is valued for its ornamental beauty, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
