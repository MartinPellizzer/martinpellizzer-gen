    "intro": "Laxanon heterophylum, commonly known as the variable leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. The botanical features of Laxanon heterophylum make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptability and morphology."
