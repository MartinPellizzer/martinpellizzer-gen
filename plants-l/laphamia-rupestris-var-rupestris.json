    "intro": "Laphamia rupestris var. rupestris, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Laphamia rupestris var. rupestris is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
