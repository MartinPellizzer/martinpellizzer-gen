It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its flat, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It thrives on bark and rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
