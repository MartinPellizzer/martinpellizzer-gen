    "intro": "Lepismium erectum, commonly known as the silver torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, silver-gray spines. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
