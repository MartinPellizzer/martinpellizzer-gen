It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces seeds that contain a unique type of fatty acid, making it of interest for industrial and agricultural research. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
