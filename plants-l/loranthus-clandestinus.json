    "intro": "Loranthus clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is native to Australia and is considered a rare and specialized component of its ecosystem."
