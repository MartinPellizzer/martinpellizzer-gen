    "intro": "Lupinus citrinus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus citrinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-improving properties."
