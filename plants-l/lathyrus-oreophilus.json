It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or violet, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus oreophilus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments."
