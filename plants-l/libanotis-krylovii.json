    "intro": "Libanotis krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and slender, branched stems. It blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
