    "intro": "Lonicera prostrata, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous trailing vine native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its opposite leaves and the presence of four stamens in its flowers."
