    "intro": "Lepanthes valerieae, commonly known as the Valerie's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. Lepanthes valerieae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
