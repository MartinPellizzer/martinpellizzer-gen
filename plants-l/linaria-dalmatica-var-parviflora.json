    "intro": "Linaria dalmatica var. parviflora, commonly known as the Dalmatian toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkans. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
