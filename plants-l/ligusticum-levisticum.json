    "intro": "Ligusticum levisticum, commonly known as lovage, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, ridged stems and finely divided leaves. Its roots and leaves contain compounds such as apiol and phellandrene, which contribute to its strong, licorice-like aroma. Lovage is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
