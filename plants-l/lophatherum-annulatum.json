    "intro": "Lophatherum annulatum, commonly known as the threadleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Lophatherum annulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
