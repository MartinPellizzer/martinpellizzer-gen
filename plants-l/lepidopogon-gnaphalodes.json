    "intro": "Lepidopogon gnaphalodes, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as sand dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and sandy environments."
