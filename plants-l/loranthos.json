    "intro": "Loranthos, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host plant. Loranthos produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This plant has a long history of cultural significance, particularly in holiday traditions."
