    "intro": "Lepidoneuron biauritum, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two prominent horn-like projections on the labellum, which contribute to its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specialized insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepidoneuron biauritum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
