    "intro": "Lupinus obtunsus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Lupinus obtunsus is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
