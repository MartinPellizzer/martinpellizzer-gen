    "intro": "Lonicera insularis, commonly known as the Bahamian honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, woody stems with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, and the plant also produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Lonicera insularis is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat."
