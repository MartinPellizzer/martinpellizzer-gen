    "intro": "Loranthus auriculatus, commonly known as the golden shower tree or Indian banyan, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are opposite or whorled. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It typically grows as a parasite on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. Its presence can affect the growth and health of the host plant, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging."
