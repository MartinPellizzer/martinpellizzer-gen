    "intro": "Lasianthera umbellata var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf sand mat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to rocky or sandy soils. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits in arid landscapes."
