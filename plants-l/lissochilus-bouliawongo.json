    "intro": "Lissochilus bouliawongo, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
