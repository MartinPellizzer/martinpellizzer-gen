    "intro": "Languas henryi, commonly known as Henry's langusta, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Languas henryi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
