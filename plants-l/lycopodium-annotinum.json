    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of pine needles. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodium annotinum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
