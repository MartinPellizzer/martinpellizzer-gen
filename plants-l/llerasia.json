    "intro": "Llerasia, commonly known as the \"wild coffee\" or \"mountain coffee,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with elliptical or ovate leaves that are usually opposite or whorled. Llerasia species produce small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or for their potential medicinal properties."
