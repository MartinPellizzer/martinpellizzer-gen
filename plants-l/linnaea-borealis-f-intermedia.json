    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in pairs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
