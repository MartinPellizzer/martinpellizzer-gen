It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that typically reach heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus depressus is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands."
