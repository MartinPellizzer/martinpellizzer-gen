    "intro": "Lonicera ovalis var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its varietal name. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive waxy coating. It produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. This plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
