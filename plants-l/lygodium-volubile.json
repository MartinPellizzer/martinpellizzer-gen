    "intro": "Lygodium volubile, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical climbing fern native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to climb and spread along trees and other structures. Its spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Lygodium volubile is often found in humid, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions."
