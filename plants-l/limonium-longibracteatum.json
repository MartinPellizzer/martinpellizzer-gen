    "intro": "Limonium longibracteatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. Its bracts, which are modified leaves, are often longer than the flower itself, giving it a distinctive appearance. Limonium longibracteatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
