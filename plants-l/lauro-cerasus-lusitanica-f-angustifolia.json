    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus lusitanica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are narrow and glossy, giving it a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for hedges or garden borders. Its slow growth rate and winter hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
