    "intro": "Lycopodium nummulariifolium, commonly known as the shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It has a distinctive appearance with shield-shaped, glossy green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
