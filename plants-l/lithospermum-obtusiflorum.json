It features a taproot system and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Lithospermum obtusiflorum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
