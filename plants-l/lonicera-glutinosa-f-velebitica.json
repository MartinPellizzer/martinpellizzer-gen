    "intro": "Lonicera glutinosa f. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit honeysuckle, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Velebit mountain range in Croatia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
