    "intro": "Lepicystis \u00d7 leucospora, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its role in horticultural breeding and its aesthetic appeal in floral arrangements."
