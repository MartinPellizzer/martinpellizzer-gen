    "intro": "Linum toxicum, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly atropine and scopolamine, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and waste areas. Despite its beauty, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions due to its toxicity and invasive growth habits."
