    "intro": "Lannea gossweileri var. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentella lannea, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species is valued for its hardiness and potential use in local agriculture and traditional medicine."
