    "intro": "Ligusticum corsicum var. mufraricciae, commonly known as Corsican lovage, is a rare variant of the Ligusticum genus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its rhizomes contain volatile oils, making it a subject of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
