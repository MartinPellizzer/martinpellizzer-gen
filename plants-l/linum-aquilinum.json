It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Linum aquilinum is also valued for its historical use in textile production and as a source of oil."
