    "intro": "Lychnis apetala f. palea, commonly known as the pale lady's mantle, is a variant of the lady's mantle plant native to Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that features distinctive silver-white or pale green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
