    "intro": "Limniris neoensata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Limniris neoensata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms."
