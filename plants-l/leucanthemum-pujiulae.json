    "intro": "Leucanthemum pujiulae, commonly known as the Pujil\u00e1 leucanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy white ray florets surrounding a central disc of yellow tubular flowers, typical of the genus Leucanthemum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
