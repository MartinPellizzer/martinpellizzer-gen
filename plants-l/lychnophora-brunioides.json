    "intro": "Lychnophora brunioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
