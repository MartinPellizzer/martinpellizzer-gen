It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered at the ends of the stems. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with glabrous (smooth) bracts. This plant is often found in wet or marshy habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
