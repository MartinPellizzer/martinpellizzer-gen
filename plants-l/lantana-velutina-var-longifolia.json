It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance.
