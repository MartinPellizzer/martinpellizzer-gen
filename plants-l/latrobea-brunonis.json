    "intro": "Latrobea brunonis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichenwood, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Latrobea brunonis is also known for its slow growth and is considered a rare and threatened species due to habitat loss."
