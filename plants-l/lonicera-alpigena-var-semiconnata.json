    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena var. semiconnata, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cooler. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in late summer, providing food for birds and other wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh, mountainous conditions."
