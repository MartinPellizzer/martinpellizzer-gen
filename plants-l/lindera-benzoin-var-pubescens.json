    "intro": "Lindera benzoin var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable plant for native gardens."
