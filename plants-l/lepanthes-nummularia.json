    "intro": "Lepanthes nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, round, white to pale green pseudobulbs and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical and slightly fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Lepanthes nummularia is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal."
