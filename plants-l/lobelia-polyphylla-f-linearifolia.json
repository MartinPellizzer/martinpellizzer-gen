    "intro": "Lobelia polyphylla f. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved lobelia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that give it its common name, and its clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant of Lobelia polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
