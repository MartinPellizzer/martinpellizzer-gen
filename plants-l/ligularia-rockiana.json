    "intro": "Ligularia rockiana, commonly known as the rock garden ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often adorned with a prominent vein. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its robust growth and ability to tolerate cooler climates."
