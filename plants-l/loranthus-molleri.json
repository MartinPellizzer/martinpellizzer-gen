    "intro": "Loranthus molleri, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Canary Islands, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus molleri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
