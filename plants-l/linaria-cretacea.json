    "intro": "Linaria cretacea, commonly known as the Mediterranean toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Linaria cretacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
