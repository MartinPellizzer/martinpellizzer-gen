    "intro": "Leiosandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by capsule-like fruits. Leiosandra thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
