    "intro": "Lycopodium sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing cones. It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporophytes that develop into stalked, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain spores. Lycopodium sparsifolium has a low-growing habit and often forms dense mats on the forest floor. Its botanical features reflect its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
