    "intro": "Liparis oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on rocks or in shaded forest areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
