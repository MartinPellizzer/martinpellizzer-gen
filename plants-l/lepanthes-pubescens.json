    "intro": "Lepanthes pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink color with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it the \"pubescent\" descriptor. Lepanthes pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
