    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two, giving it the common name \"twinflower.\" The leaves are oval-shaped, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture compared to the typical smooth foliage of the species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
