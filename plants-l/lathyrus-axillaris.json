It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in grasslands and along woodland edges. The plant features slender, trailing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple, blooming in early summer.
