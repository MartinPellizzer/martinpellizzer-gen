    "intro": "Lindsaea lobata var. hainaniana, commonly known as the Hainan lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds."
