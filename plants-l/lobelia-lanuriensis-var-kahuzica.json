    "intro": "Lobelia lanuriensis var. kahuzica, commonly known as the Kahuzi lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
