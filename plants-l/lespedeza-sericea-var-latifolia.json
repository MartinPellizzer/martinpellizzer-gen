    "intro": "Lespedeza sericea var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, appearing in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are narrow to broad, with a silvery underside that gives it a distinctive appearance. Broadleaf lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
