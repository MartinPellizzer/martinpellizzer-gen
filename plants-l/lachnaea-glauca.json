    "intro": "Lachnaea glauca, commonly known as the blue lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a distinct botanical structure composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga. It typically forms a crust-like growth on rocks, bark, or soil surfaces, displaying a bluish-green color due to the presence of the algal partner. The thallus is generally thin and loosely attached, with a granular or powdery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. This lichen is notable for its role in ecological succession and as an indicator of air quality."
