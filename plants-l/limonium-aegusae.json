    "intro": "Limonium aegusae, commonly known as the Greek sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in coastal or sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to saline and arid conditions. Limonium aegusae is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
