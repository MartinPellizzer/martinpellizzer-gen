    "intro": "Laurus floribunda, commonly known as the sweet bay laurel, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are highly fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in cooking, medicine, and as a symbol of honor and achievement."
