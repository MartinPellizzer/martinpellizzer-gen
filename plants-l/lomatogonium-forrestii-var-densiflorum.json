    "intro": "Lomatogonium forrestii var. densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered lomatogonium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
