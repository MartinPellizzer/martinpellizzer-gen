    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat flax, is a perennial shrub native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces capsules containing numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
