    "intro": "Limonium rigualii, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Limonium rigualii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
