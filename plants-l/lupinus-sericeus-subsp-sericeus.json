    "intro": "Lupinus sericeus subsp. sericeus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
