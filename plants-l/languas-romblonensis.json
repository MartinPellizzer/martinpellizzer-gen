    "intro": "Languas romblonensis, commonly known as the Romblon spider-orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is adapted to thrive in the specific microclimates of Romblon Island, where it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
