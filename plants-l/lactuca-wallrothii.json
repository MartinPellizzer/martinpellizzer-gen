    "intro": "Lactuca wallrothii, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, lobed leaves, and yellow composite flowers. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. Lactuca wallrothii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
