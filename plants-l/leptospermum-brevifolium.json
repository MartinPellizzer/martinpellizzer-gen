    "intro": "Leptospermum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in coastal and heathland environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
