    "intro": "Limonium dianiae, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
