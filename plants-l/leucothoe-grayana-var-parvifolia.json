    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. parvifolia, commonly known as smallleaf flameleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soils. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact form."
