    "intro": "Lachnostoma arizonicum, commonly known as the Arizona lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal component and a photosynthetic algal partner, which together form a symbiotic relationship. This lichen is typically found on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in the southwestern United States. Its morphology includes a crustose thallus with a pale to dark green or brown coloration. Lachnostoma arizonicum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
