    "intro": "Lepidium nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stemed cress, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a small, herbaceous annual that grows close to the ground, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Lepidium nudicaule is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its alpine and tundra habitats."
