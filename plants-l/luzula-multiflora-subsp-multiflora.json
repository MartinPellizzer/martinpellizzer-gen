    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the common wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range. Luzula multiflora subsp. multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
