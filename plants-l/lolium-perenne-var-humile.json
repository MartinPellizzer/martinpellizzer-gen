    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. humile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are slightly folded. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its rapid establishment and use in forage and erosion control."
