    "intro": "Lastila, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Lastila is considered a cryptic species with minimal documented ecological interactions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical wonder from habitat loss and over-collection."
