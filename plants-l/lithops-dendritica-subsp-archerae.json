    "intro": "Lithops dendritica subsp. archerae, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a species of succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It requires minimal water and thrives in bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
