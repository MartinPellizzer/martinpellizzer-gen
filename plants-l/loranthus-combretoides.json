    "intro": "Loranthus combretoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Combretaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain seeds, are dispersed by birds and other animals. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa."
