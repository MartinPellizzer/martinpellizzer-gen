It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus guaraniticus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
