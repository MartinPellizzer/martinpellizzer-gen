    "intro": "Leobordea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping leobordea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Leobordea decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
