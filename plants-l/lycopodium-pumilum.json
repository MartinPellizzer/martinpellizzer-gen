    "intro": "Lycopodium pumilum, commonly known as the little clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Lycopodium pumilum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
