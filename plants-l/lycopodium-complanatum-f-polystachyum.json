    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum f. polystachyum, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a fern ally with a distinctive, compact growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in strobili at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
