    "intro": "Leucopogon megacarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a compact manner, typical of heath species. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in sandy soils."
