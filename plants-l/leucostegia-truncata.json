    "intro": "Leucostegia truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive truncate or notched base. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Leucostegia truncata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
