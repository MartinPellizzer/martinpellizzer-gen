    "intro": "Limnophila costaricensis f. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic water lettuce, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Central America. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its morphology is adapted for life in aquatic habitats, with specialized structures for buoyancy and nutrient absorption."
