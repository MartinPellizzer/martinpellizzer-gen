    "intro": "Lythrum flavum, commonly known as yellow lythrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lythraceae family, which includes plants such as the common willow herb. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Yellow lythrum produces clusters of small, pink to yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
