    "intro": "Lagetta linearia, commonly known as the linear leaf vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and linear in shape. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, and is often found in grassland ecosystems. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or through animal activity."
