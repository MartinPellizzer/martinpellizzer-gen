    "intro": "Lindsaea guianensis var. imbricata, commonly known as the Guianan lace fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of leaflets that enhance its ornamental appeal."
