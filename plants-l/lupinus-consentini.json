    "intro": "Lupinus consentini, commonly known as the Mexican lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lupinus consentini has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
