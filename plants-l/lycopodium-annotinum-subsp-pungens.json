    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum subsp. pungens, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This subspecies is distinguished by its spiny structures on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
