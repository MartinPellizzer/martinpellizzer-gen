    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. sabinifolium, commonly known as the sabinifolium clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its sporophytes bear clusters of sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. This variety is notable for its distinctive foliage, which resembles the leaves of the sabin tree, hence its common name."
