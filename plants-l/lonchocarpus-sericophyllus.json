    "intro": "Lonchocarpus sericophyllus, commonly known as the silky-leaf legume, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a silky, smooth texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is native to regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitats."
