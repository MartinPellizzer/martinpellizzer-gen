It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to desert conditions. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Larrea multijuga is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
