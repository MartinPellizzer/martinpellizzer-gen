    "intro": "Lindernia pedunculata, commonly known as the slender lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. The plant produces showy spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lindernia pedunculata is valued in gardens for its attractive foliage and nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators."
