    "intro": "Ligusticum nullivittatum, commonly known as the white ligusticum, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
