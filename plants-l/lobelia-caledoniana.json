    "intro": "Lobelia caledoniana, commonly known as the Caledonian lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia caledoniana is notable for its ecological significance, supporting local insect populations and thriving in nutrient-poor soils."
