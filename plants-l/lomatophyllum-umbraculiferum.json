    "intro": "Lomatophyllum umbraculiferum, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves that provide shade, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lomatophyllum umbraculiferum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal."
