    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a low, carpet-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically reddish-brown and clustered at the base of the stems. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense ground cover make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
