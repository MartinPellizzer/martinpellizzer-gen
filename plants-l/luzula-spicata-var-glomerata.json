It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects and a subject of study in plant morphology and taxonomy."
