    "intro": "Launaea chevalieri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea chevalieri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
