    "intro": "Ligusticum brachylobum, commonly known as the California angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and tall, branched umbels of small, yellowish-green flowers. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a taproot that is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in native ecosystems."
