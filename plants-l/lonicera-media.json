    "intro": "Lonicera media, commonly known as trumpet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces showy, tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant also produces red, fleshy berries that are eaten by birds. Lonicera media is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
