    "intro": "Loranthus heyneanus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of new hosts. Loranthus heyneanus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
