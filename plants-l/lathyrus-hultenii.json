    "intro": "Lathyrus hultenii, commonly known as Hult\u00e9n's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Lathyrus hultenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
