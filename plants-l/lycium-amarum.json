    "intro": "Lycium amarum, commonly known as bitterwolfberry, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are evergreen, and the plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Lycium amarum has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its fruits."
