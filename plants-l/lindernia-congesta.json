    "intro": "Lindernia congesta, commonly known as the clustered lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia congesta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
