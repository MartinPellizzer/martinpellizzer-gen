It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native gardens. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun."
