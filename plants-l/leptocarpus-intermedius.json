    "intro": "Leptocarpus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. Leptocarpus intermedius plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
