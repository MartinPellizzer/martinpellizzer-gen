    "intro": "Lithops inornata, commonly known as the \"Pebble Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, with two fleshy leaves that resemble small pebbles. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It blooms with bright yellow or orange flowers during the winter months. Lithops inornata is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
