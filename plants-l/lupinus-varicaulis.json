    "intro": "Lupinus varicaulis, commonly known as the variable lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. Lupinus varicaulis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
