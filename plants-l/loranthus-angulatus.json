    "intro": "Loranthus angulatus, commonly known as the angular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of the host tree. Loranthus angulatus plays a role in ecological interactions, providing food for birds and insects while also affecting the growth of its host."
