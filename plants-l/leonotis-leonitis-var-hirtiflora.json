It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, resembling a lion's tail. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This ornamental plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
