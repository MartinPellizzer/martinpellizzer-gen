    "intro": "Lindernia subulata, commonly known as the slender lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing herb with small, needle-like leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lindernia subulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
