    "intro": "Leptospermum baccatum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathlands and coastal scrub. Leptospermum baccatum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
