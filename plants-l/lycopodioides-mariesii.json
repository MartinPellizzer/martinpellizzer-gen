    "intro": "Lycopodioides mariesii, commonly known as the Marie's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems that bear spiral arrangements of leaves, typical of many primitive vascular plants. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in cones at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
