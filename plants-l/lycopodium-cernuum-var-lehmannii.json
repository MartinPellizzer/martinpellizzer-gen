It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
