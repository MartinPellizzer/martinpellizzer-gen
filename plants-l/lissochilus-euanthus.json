    "intro": "Lissochilus euanthus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
