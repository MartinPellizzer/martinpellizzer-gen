    "intro": "Luzula spicata f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf woodrush, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and related plants, though it is often classified as a sedge due to its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant features dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with silver or white markings. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and shaded borders, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
