    "intro": "Listrostachys forcipata, commonly known as the hook-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
