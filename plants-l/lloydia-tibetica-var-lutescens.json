    "intro": "Lloydia tibetica var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow lloydia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
