    "intro": "Lobelia macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lobelia macrostachya is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
