It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Lycopodium strictum plays a significant role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
