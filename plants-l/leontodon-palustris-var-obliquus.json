    "intro": "Leontodon palustris var. obliquus, commonly known as the bent-leaved bog grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. This variety is closely related to other members of the dandelion family, Asteraceae, and is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
