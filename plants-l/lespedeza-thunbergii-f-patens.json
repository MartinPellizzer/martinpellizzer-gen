    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii f. patens, commonly known as the spreading lespedeza, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to East Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense ground cover. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It is often used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
