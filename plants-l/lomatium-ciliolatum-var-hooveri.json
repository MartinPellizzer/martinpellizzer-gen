    "intro": "Lomatium ciliolatum var. hooveri, commonly known as the Hoover's lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are fern-like, with ciliate margins, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
