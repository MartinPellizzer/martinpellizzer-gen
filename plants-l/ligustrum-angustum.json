    "intro": "Ligustrum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. Ligustrum angustum is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
