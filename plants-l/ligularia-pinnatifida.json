    "intro": "Ligularia pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (broadly lobed) margin, giving it a striking, tropical appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its foliage is popular in ornamental gardening for its bold, decorative leaves."
