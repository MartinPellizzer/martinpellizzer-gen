    "intro": "Lunathyrium, commonly known as the moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its night-blooming white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its botanical name reflects its association with the moon, as its flowers open only under moonlight. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
