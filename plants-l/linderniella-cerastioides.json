    "intro": "Linderniella cerastioides, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue to violet in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Linderniella cerastioides is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
