    "intro": "Leptocytisus tenellus, commonly known as the creeping rose or sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Leptocytisus tenellus is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub habitats."
