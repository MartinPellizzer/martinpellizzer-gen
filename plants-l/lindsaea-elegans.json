    "intro": "Lindsaea elegans, commonly known as the elegant spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spirally arranged spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lindsaea elegans thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its morphology reflects adaptations to humid, low-light conditions typical of its natural habitat."
