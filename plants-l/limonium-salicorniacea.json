    "intro": "Limonium salicorniacea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plumbagaceae family. It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limonium salicorniacea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
