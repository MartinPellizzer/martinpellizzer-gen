    "intro": "Lygodesmia triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled lygodesmia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of horticultural circles."
