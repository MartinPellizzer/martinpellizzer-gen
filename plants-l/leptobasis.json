    "intro": "Leptobasis, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have palmate leaves and showy, often pink or white, flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. They are characterized by their fibrous bark and the presence of mucilage in their tissues. Leptobasis species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
