It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with multiple small leaflets and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in moist, well-drained habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Lupinus nootkatensis var. perlanatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
