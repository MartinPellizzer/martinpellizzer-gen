    "intro": "Leucopogon brachycephalus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy, acidic soils within coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are typically pink or reddish in color. This variety is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Leucopogon."
