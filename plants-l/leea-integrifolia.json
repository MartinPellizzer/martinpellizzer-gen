    "intro": "Leea integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf leeah, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically broad and entire. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Leea integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
