    "intro": "Leptoloma miliacea, commonly known as the millet mushroom, is a species of edible fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow cap and a slender, often slightly curved stem. The mushroom typically grows in association with grasses and is often found in open, sunny areas. It is notable for its mild, slightly sweet flavor and is sometimes used in traditional cuisines. Due to its delicate structure, it is usually cooked briefly to maintain its texture and flavor."
