    "intro": "Lemboglossum ureskinneri, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant found primarily in the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lemboglossum ureskinneri is considered a vulnerable species."
