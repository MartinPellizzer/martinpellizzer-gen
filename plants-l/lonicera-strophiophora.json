    "intro": "Lonicera strophiophora, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which appear in late summer, are small and black, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Lonicera strophiophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
