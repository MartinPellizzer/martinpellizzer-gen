    "intro": "Lonicera semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East of Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Lonicera semenovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
