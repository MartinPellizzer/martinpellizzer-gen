    "intro": "Lilium gongshanense, commonly known as the Gongshan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly large, pale pink to white flowers with a subtle red tinge. The plant typically grows in high-altitude mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that support the plant's growth and survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
