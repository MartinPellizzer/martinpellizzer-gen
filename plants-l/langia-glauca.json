    "intro": "Langia glauca, commonly known as the blue langia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or bluish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Langia glauca is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
