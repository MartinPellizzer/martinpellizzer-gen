    "intro": "Lagotis glauca, commonly known as blue flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist soil and full sun, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Lagotis glauca plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
