    "intro": "Lindera citriodora, commonly known as lemon thyme or sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a lemony scent when crushed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its berries are bright red and contain small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Lindera citriodora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
