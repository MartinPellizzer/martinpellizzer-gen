    "intro": "Larrea viscosa, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
