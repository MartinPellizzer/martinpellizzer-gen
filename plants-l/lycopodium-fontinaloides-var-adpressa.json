    "intro": "Lycopodium fontinaloides var. adpressa, commonly known as the flattened clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory plant communities."
