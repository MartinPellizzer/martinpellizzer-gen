    "intro": "Leptochilus henryi, commonly known as Henry's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
