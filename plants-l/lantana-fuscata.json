    "intro": "Lantana fuscata, commonly known as the gray lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the verbena family (Verbenaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish or whitish bloom, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Lantana fuscata is typically perennial, though it may behave as an annual in some regions, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
