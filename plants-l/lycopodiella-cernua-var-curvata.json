    "intro": "Lycopodiella cernua var. curvata, commonly known as the nodding clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
