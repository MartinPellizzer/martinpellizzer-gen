    "intro": "Lathyrus kilimandscharicus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in the mountainous areas of Tanzania and Kenya. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soil conditions. Lathyrus kilimandscharicus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
