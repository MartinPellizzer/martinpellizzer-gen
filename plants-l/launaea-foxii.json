    "intro": "Launaea foxii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Launaea foxii is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can go dormant during periods of extreme drought."
