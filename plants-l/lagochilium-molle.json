    "intro": "Lagochilium molle, commonly known as the soft-hair mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in short inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for dispersal. Lagochilium molle plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
