    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. pacyi, commonly known as the Pacific perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This variety is well adapted to moist, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass applications due to its rapid establishment and wear tolerance. However, it is less cold-hardy compared to other ryegrass varieties, limiting its use in colder regions."
