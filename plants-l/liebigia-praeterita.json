    "intro": "Liebigia praeterita, commonly known as the slender liebigia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
