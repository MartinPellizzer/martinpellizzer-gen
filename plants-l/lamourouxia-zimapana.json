    "intro": "Lamourouxia zimapana, commonly known as the Zimapana orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms compact, evergreen shrubs with narrow leaves. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lamourouxia zimapana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
