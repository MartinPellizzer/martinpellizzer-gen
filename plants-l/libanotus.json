    "intro": "Libanotus, commonly known as the bluebell or wild bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. Libanotus species often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of their habitats."
