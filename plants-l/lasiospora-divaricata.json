    "intro": "Lasiospora divaricata, commonly known as the branched hair lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Its structure includes a distinct upper cortex, medulla, and lower cortex, which contribute to its resilience and adaptability."
