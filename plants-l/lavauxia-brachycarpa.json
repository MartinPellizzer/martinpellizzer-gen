    "intro": "Lavauxia brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited lavauxia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, short, spherical fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
