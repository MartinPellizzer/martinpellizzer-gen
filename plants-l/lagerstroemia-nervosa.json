    "intro": "Lagerstroemia nervosa, commonly known as the Chinese flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that range in color from white to deep pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have prominent veins. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Lagerstroemia nervosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
