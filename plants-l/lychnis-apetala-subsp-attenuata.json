It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of pink to red flowers. The subspecies attenuata is distinguished by its elongated, attenuated leaves and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Lychnis apetala. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its early spring blooming period."
