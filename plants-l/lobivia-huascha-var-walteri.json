    "intro": "Lobivia huascha var. walteri, commonly known as the Walter's lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lobivia huascha var. walteri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
