    "intro": "Lewisia triphylla, commonly known as the Three-leaved Lewisia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
