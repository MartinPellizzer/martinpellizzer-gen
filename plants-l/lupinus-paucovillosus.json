    "intro": "Lupinus paucovillosus, commonly known as the sparsely hairy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus paucovillosus is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
