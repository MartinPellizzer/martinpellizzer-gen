    "intro": "Laennecia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved laennecia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are usually pale blue or white. Laennecia parvifolia is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
