    "intro": "Leontodon carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, grass-like leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a cluster of yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds with white pappus that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. Leontodon carolinianus is an annual plant that plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
