    "intro": "Lepidagathis glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features small, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought-resistant nature. Lepidagathis glaucifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
