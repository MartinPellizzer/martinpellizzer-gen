    "intro": "Lithophragma rupicola, commonly known as the rock bladder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Lithophragma rupicola is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
