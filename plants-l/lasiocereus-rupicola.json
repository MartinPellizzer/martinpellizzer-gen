    "intro": "Lasiocereus rupicola, commonly known as the rock candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch out into a candelabra-like shape. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh conditions."
