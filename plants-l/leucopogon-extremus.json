    "intro": "Leucopogon extremus, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate it from extreme cold. Leucopogon extremus is adapted to low nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or barren landscapes."
