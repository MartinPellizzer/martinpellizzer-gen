    "intro": "Loranthus globifer, commonly known as the globeflower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus globifer is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with trees such as elms and maples."
