    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 oellgaardii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a species resulting from the cross between Lycopodium clavatum and Lycopodium annotinum. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact mat. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium \u00d7 oellgaardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
