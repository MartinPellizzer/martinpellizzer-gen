    "intro": "Loranthus cornetii, commonly known as the Cornet's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
