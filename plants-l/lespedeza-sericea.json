    "intro": "Lespedeza sericea, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides. Lespedeza sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
