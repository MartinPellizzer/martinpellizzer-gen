    "intro": "Lebronnecia, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen shrubs with dense, needle-like leaves that resemble those of holly. The flowers are typically small, bell-shaped, and clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of white or pink. Lebronnecia species are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and attractive foliage."
