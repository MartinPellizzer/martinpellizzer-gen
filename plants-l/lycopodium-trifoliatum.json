    "intro": "Lycopodium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium trifoliatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems highlight its significance in both botanical and ecological contexts."
