    "intro": "Listera cordata f. tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed basket lily, is a rare and distinctive variant of the basket lily species. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring four leaves arranged in a whorl, which sets it apart from the typical three-leaf form. The plant is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical interest lies in its rarity and unusual morphology, making it a subject of study in botanic gardens and conservation efforts."
