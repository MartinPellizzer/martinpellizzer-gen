    "intro": "Lithops jacobseniana, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Lithops jacobseniana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
