    "intro": "Lysimachia maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often prostrate or erect depending on the habitat. Lysimachia maritima is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
