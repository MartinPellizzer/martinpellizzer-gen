It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus albertensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
