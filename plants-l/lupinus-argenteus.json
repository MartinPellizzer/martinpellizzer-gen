    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Silver lupine thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
