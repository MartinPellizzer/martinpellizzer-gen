    "intro": "Lotodes cuspidatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. Lotodes cuspidatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
