It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically yellow-green on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its aromatic leaves and twigs have been used historically for their medicinal properties. Lindera bifaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
