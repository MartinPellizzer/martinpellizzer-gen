    "intro": "Linaria elatine var. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sand-rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh maritime environments and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
