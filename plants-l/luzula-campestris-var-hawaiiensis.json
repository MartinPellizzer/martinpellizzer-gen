    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sedge, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grassy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Botanically, it is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants."
