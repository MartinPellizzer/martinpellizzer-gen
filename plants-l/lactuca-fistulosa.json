    "intro": "Lactuca fistulosa, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branching stem with small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats. Lactuca fistulosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
