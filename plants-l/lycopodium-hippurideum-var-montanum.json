    "intro": "Lycopodium hippurideum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its rhizome is often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
