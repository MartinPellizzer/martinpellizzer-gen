    "intro": "Lerchia altissima, commonly known as the tall lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that can be green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Lerchia altissima plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
