    "intro": "Linum sativum, commonly known as flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are harvested for their oil-rich seeds, which are used in food and industrial applications. Linum sativum is also valued for its fibrous stems, which are used in textile manufacturing."
