    "intro": "Linanthus plaskettii, commonly known as Plaskett's linanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. This annual plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
