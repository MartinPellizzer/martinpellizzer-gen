    "intro": "Leontonyx neglectus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, relying on deep root systems to access underground moisture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
