    "intro": "Lobularia intermedia var. argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf lobularia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
