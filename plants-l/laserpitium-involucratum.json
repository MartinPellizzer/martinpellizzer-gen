It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing a yellow-orange color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
