    "intro": "Lotodes obliquum, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are showy, often with white or pink petals. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems support the floating foliage. Lotodes obliquum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shade for various aquatic life."
