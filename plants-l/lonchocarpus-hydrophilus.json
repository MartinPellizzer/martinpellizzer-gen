It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive pod fruits that contain flat, oblong seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its natural habitat."
