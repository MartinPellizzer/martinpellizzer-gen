    "intro": "Limniris lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warm season. Its sap is milky and contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested. Limniris lactea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, well-drained soil conditions."
