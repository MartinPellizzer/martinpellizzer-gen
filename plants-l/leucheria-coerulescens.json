    "intro": "Leucheria coerulescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, blue misty clouds. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. Its showy, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leucheria coerulescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
