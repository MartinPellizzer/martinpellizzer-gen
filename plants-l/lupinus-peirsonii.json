    "intro": "Lupinus peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus peirsonii plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
