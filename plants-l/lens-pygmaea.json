    "intro": "Lens pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lentil, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are typically less than 2 millimeters in diameter. The plant has trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often grown as a cover crop or for its ornamental value. Due to its tiny size, it is sometimes mistaken for a weed in cultivated fields."
