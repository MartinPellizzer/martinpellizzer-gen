    "intro": "Lespedeza bicolor f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping lespedeza, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping inflorescences that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple hue at the base. Native to East Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its feathery foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
