    "intro": "Lesquerella kingii subsp. bernardina, commonly known as the Bernardina lesquerella, is a rare and specialized member of the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and covered in fine, glandular hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
