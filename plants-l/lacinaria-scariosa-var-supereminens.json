    "intro": "Lacinaria scariosa var. supereminens, commonly known as the showy lacinaria, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is heightened by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
