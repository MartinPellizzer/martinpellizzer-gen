    "intro": "Leucaena trichodes, commonly known as the hairy leucaena, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods containing flattened, seed-filled legumes, which are a source of forage for livestock. It is adapted to poor soils and is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Leucaena trichodes is also valued for its rapid growth and potential in soil stabilization and erosion control."
