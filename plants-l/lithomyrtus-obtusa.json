    "intro": "Lithomyrtus obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf hollybush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Lithomyrtus obtusa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
