    "intro": "Loureira albens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its unique appearance and valuable wood, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to both horticulturists and conservationists."
