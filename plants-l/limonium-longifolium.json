    "intro": "Limonium longifolium, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Limonium longifolium is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
