    "intro": "Loxogramme biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed water clover, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into two lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Loxogramme biformis is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from the water."
