    "intro": "Loxocalyx, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 lobes, giving it a distinctive, maple-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red fruits that split open to reveal three winged seeds. Loxocalyx thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
