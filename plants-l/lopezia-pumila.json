    "intro": "Lopezia pumila, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Lopezia pumila is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
