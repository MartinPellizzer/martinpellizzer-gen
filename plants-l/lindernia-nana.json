    "intro": "Lindernia nana, commonly known as dwarf lindernia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
