    "intro": "Ligusticum glaucescens, commonly known as blue ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013100 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
