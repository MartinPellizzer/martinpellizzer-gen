    "intro": "Lomaxeta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lomaxeta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly wavy margin. Lomaxeta is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
