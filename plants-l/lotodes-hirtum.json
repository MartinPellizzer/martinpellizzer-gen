    "intro": "Lotodes hirtum, commonly known as the hairy water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life."
