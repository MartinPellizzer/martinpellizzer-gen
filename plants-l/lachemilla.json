    "intro": "Lachemilla, commonly known as moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, often white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Lachemilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
