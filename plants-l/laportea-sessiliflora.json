    "intro": "Laportea sessiliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, rich soils. It has a woody stem and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Laportea sessiliflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
