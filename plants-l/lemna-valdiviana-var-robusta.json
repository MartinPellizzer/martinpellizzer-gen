    "intro": "Lemna valdiviana var. robusta, commonly known as the robust water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the duckweed family (Araceae) and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green to yellowish in color. The plant reproduces vegetatively through the production of tubers, which allow it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its fast growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
