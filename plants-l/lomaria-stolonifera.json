    "intro": "Lomaria stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping lomaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Lomaria stolonifera is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
