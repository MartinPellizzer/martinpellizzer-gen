    "intro": "Landolphia owariensis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy, tomentose appearance gives it its specific variety name."
