    "intro": "Larix americana var. incurva, commonly known as the American larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling, giving it a striking seasonal appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, with a narrow, conical shape and a rugged, fissured bark. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
