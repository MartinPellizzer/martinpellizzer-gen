    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered lespeadeza, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
