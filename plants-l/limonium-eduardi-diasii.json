It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
