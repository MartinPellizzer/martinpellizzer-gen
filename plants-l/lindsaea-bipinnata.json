    "intro": "Lindsaea bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into secondary pinnae, giving it a finely branched appearance. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea bipinnata is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, demonstrating its adaptability to various substrates."
