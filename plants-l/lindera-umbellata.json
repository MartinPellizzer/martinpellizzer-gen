    "intro": "Lindera umbellata, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. Lindera umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
