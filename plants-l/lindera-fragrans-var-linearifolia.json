    "intro": "Lindera fragrans var. linearifolia, commonly known as the fragrant lindera or narrow-leaved lindera, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is often distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lindera fragrans."
