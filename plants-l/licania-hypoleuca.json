    "intro": "Licania hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-leaf licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Licania hypoleuca is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
