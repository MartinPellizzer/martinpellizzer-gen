    "intro": "Lecanthus peduncularis var. pterocarpa, commonly known as the winged lecanthus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, wing-like structures on its fruit capsules, which aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, with a delicate white or pale green coloration."
