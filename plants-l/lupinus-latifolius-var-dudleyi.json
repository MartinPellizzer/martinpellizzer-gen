    "intro": "Lupinus latifolius var. dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Like other lupines, it plays a vital role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
