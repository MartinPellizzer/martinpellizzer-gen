    "intro": "Lobelia puberula f. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabella' form has reduced or absent pubescence on the upper surface. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland gardens or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
