    "intro": "Leptadenia appendiculata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is known for its latex sap, which is milky and can be toxic, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Leptadenia appendiculata thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to poor soil conditions."
