    "intro": "Loranthus rugulosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rough, waxy texture, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems."
