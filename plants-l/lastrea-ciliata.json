    "intro": "Lastrea ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
