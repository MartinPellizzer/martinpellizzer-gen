    "intro": "Lastrea indecora, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
