    "intro": "Lomatium bentonitum, commonly known as Benton's lomatium, is a member of the parsley family (Apiaceae) and is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its roots are fibrous and have been used historically by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Lomatium bentonitum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas along the coast."
