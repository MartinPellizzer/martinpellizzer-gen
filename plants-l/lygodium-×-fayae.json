    "intro": "Lygodium \u00d7 fayae, commonly known as the hybrid climbing fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Lygodium microphyllum and Lygodium japonicum. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and ability to climb using its wiry, spore-bearing fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in clusters. Its rapid spread makes it an invasive species in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
