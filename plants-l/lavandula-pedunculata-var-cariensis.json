    "intro": "Lavandula pedunculata var. cariensis, commonly known as the Carian lavender, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and mild lavender scent, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lavender species."
