    "intro": "Linum rigidum var. berlandieri, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert and semi-desert regions. Its fibrous stem and leaves have been used historically by indigenous peoples for fiber and medicinal purposes."
