    "intro": "Loranthus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by birds and insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
