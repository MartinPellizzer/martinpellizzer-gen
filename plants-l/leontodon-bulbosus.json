    "intro": "Leontodon bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, robust stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its bulbous base allows it to store nutrients, aiding survival in less favorable conditions. Leontodon bulbosus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
