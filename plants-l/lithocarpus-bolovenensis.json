It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Lithocarpus bolovenensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
