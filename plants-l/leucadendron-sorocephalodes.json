    "intro": "Leucadendron sorocephalodes, commonly known as the silver leaf leucadendron, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its conical, yellow to orange flower head surrounded by pale green to silver bracts. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its foliage is evergreen, with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to the vibrant flower heads. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and coastal conditions."
