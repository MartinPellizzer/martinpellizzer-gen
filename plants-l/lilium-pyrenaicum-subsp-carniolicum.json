    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum subsp. carniolicum, commonly known as the Carniolan lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathians. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous underground storage organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
