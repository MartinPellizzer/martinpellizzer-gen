It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is often found in areas with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
