    "intro": "Leptospermum ericoides, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
