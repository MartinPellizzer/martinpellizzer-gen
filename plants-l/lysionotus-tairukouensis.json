It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
