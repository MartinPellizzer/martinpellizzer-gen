    "intro": "Lepianthes umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Lepianthes umbellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
