    "intro": "Lotus trifoliastrum, commonly known as the three-leaf lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval and glossy. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. Lotus trifoliastrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
