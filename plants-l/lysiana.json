    "intro": "Lysiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Lysiana has small, strap-like leaves that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
