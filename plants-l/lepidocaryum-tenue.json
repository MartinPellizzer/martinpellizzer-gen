It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via runners make it a resilient species in harsh environments.
