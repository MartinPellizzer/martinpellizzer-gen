    "intro": "Lunathyrium pycnosorum, commonly known as the dense-leaved moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, small, and often clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped leaflets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
