    "intro": "Lycianthes purpusii, commonly known as the purple eggplant or Mexican eggplant, is a species native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), characterized by its distinctive purple or violet fruits that resemble small, elongated eggs. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in dry to semi-arid environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other eggplant varieties."
