    "intro": "Lasiandra fontanesiana var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lasiandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated margins, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in understory habitats of tropical forests, where it relies on specific soil conditions and canopy cover for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
