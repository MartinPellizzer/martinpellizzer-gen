    "intro": "Loranthus edouardii, commonly known as the Edouard's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It primarily attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Australia and Southeast Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
