    "intro": "Ligusticum aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless lovage, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent foliage. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, with most of its photosynthetic activity occurring through its stems and flowers. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ligusticum aciphylla is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
