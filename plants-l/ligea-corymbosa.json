    "intro": "Ligea corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered ligea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Ligea corymbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant."
