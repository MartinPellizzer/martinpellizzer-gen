    "intro": "Lophogyne ceratophylla, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Lophogyne ceratophylla is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
