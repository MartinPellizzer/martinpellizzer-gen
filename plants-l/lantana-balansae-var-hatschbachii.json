    "intro": "Lantana balansae var. hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming throughout the year. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various coastal and inland environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
