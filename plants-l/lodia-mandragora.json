    "intro": "Lodia mandragora, commonly known as devil's lettuce, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its historical use in folklore and medicine, it has been the subject of much cultural and scientific interest."
