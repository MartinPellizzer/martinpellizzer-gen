    "intro": "Liparis bituberculata var. hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Hachijo Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
