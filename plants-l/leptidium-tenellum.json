    "intro": "Leptidium tenellum, commonly known as the small bladdergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, bladder-like pods, which aid in seed dispersal. Leptidium tenellum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
