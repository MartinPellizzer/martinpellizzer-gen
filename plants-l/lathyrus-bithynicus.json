    "intro": "Lathyrus bithynicus, commonly known as the Bithynian vetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has slender, branching stems. Lathyrus bithynicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
