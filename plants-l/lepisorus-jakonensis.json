    "intro": "Lepisorus jakonensis, commonly known as the Kajon fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing sporangia on the underside. Lepisorus jakonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
