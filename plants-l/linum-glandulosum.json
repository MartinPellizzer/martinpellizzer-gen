    "intro": "Linum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky flax or glandular flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also bear the same glandular hairs. Linum glandulosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
