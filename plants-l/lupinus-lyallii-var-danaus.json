    "intro": "Lupinus lyallii var. danaus, commonly known as the Dana's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a nitrogen-fixing plant that supports local biodiversity."
