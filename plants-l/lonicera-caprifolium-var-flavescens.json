It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are orange-red and edible, though often consumed by birds rather than humans. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
