    "intro": "Lotus glinoides, commonly known as the water fern or water clover, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are often divided into small, clover-like segments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in its habitat. Lotus glinoides plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
