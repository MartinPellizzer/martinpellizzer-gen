    "intro": "Lepisorus sequipedalis, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Lepisorus sequipedalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
