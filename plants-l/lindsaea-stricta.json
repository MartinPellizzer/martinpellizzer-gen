    "intro": "Lindsaea stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a tight rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. Lindsaea stricta is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
