    "intro": "Leighia angustifolia var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-bracted orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with short, bract-like structures that give it its specific epithet. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for advanced orchid growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
