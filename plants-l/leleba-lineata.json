    "intro": "Leleba lineata, commonly known as the lined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are intricately divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinct lines along the undersides of the fronds."
