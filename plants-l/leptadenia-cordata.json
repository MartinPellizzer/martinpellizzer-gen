It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally in various medicinal practices. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
