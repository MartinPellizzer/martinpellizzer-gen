    "intro": "Lotus australis var. exstipulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system consists of tubers, which store nutrients and help the plant survive dry periods. This species is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or saline environments."
