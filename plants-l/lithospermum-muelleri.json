It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, ovate leaves with a glandular surface. Its root system is known to produce a red dye, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
