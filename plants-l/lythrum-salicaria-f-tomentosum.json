    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria f. tomentosum, commonly known as wooly loosestrife, is a variant of the common loosestrife plant. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking spikes of deep pink to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
