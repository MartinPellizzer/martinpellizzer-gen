    "intro": "Lemna trichorrhiza, commonly known as the three-ribbed duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Lemna trichorrhiza is known for its rapid growth rate, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a potential indicator of water quality."
