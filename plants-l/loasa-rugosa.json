    "intro": "Loasa rugosa, commonly known as the rough loasa, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. Loasa rugosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
