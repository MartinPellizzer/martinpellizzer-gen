It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
