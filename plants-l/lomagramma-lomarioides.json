    "intro": "Lomagramma lomarioides, commonly known as the common lomagramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lomariopsidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in compact, club-like structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lomagramma lomarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
