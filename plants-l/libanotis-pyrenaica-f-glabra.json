    "intro": "Libanotis pyrenaica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Libanotis, is a rare, low-growing perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the species. Its flowers are typically small and white, arranged in clustered umbels, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
