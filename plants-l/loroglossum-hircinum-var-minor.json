    "intro": "Loroglossum hircinum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser pigmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
