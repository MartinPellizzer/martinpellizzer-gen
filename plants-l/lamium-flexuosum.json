    "intro": "Lamium flexuosum, commonly known as creeping deadnettle, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping habit allows it to form dense mats, making it effective for soil stabilization and erosion control."
