    "intro": "Laelia autumnalis var. alba, commonly known as the white winter orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months, typically in late autumn to early winter. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, providing a lush backdrop to the delicate white blooms. This variety is prized for its beauty and adaptability in cultivated settings."
