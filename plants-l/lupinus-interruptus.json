    "intro": "Lupinus interruptus, commonly known as the Sierra lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Lupinus interruptus is adapted to dry conditions and is often seen in mountainous regions. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
