    "intro": "Lappula microcarpa var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments."
