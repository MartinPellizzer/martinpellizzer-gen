    "intro": "Linaria villosa subsp. nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Linaria villosa subsp. nummularia is often found in rocky soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
