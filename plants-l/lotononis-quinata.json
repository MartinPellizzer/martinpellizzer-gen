    "intro": "Lotononis quinata, commonly known as the African violet or the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals that are often marked with purple or violet hues. The leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments."
