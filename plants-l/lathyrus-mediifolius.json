    "intro": "Lathyrus mediifolius, commonly known as the middle-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Lathyrus mediifolius is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
