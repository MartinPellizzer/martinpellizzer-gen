It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds are rich in oils and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of lubricant. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
