    "intro": "Lepigonum salsugineum var. leiospermum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often near water bodies. The plant features simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its most distinctive characteristic is its unique, bladder-like structures that contain specialized cells for trapping small aquatic organisms. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
