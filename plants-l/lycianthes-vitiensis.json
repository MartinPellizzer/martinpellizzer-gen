    "intro": "Lycianthes vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible when ripe, though they are generally not cultivated for commercial use. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Lycianthes vitiensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats within rainforests."
