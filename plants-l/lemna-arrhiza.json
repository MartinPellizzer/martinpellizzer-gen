    "intro": "Lemna arrhiza, commonly known as the water velvet, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family. It has tiny, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to the water surface. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water's surface. Lemna arrhiza is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as habitat for small aquatic organisms."
