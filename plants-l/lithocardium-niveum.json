    "intro": "Lithocardium niveum, commonly known as the snowstone plant, is a succulent species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, grayish-green leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
