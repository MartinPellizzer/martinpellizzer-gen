    "intro": "Loranthus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Dipterocarpaceae family, using a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host, while also performing photosynthesis to some extent. It produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its presence can affect the health of the host tree and is often considered a symbol of ecological interdependence in its native habitats."
