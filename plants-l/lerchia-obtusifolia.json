It belongs to the family Apiaceae, commonly known as the carrot or parsley family, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
