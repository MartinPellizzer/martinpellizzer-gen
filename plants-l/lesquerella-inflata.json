It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in racemes, and it produces a unique, fleshy fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Lesquerella inflata is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and ecological adaptations."
