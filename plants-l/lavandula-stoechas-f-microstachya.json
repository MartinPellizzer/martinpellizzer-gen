    "intro": "Lavandula stoechas f. microstachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed lavender, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces spikes of purple-lavender flowers with distinctive, narrow, pointed bracts. The plant is characterized by its smaller, more compact flower clusters compared to the typical Lavandula stoechas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and essential oil content, used in aromatherapy and perfumery."
