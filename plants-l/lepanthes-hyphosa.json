    "intro": "Lepanthes hyphosa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes hyphosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
