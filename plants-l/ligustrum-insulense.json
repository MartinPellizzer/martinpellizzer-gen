    "intro": "Ligustrum insulense, commonly known as the Island privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by small, black berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
