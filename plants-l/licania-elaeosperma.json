    "intro": "Licania elaeosperma, commonly known as the yellow licania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with large, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Licania elaeosperma is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
