    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. chamaecyparissus, commonly known as the ground cedar, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant forms compact mats or cushions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the base of the plant, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The foliage retains its color year-round, making it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture."
