    "intro": "Lepanthes eciliata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a lady's slipper in shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without being parasitic. Lepanthes eciliata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
