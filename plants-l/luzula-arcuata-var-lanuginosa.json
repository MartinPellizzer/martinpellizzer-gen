    "intro": "Luzula arcuata var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly wood sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
