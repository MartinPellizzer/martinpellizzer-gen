    "intro": "Loranthus floribundus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. Loranthus floribundus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and tropical regions. Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on its host trees."
