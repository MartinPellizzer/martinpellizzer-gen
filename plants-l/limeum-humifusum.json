    "intro": "Limeum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a dense, mat-like growth on soil, rocks, or tree trunks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that allows it to retain moisture. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
