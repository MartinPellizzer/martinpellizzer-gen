    "intro": "Lonicera niagaralli, commonly known as Niagara honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
