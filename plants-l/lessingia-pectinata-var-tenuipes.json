    "intro": "Lessingia pectinata var. tenuipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Lessingia pectinata."
