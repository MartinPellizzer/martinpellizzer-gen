    "intro": "Lupinus nootkatensis f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered lupine, is a rare variant of the lupine species native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It has erect, branched stems and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
