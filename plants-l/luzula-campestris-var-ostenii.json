    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. ostenii, commonly known as the Osten's wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bluish-green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are greenish-white in color, are clustered in dense spikes and are pollinated primarily by insects."
