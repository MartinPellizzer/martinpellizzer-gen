    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. watsonianum, commonly known as the Watson's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, acidic soils."
