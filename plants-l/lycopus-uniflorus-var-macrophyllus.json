    "intro": "Lycopus uniflorus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as broadleaf blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broad and have a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, blue to purple, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from July to September. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
