    "intro": "Lycopsis variegata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lycopsis, is a rare and striking variant of the lycopsis genus. It is characterized by its variegated foliage, which displays a mix of green and white or cream-colored patterns. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
