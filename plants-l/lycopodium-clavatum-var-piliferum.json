    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically scale-like and densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, at the tips of its branches, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. This variant is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
