    "intro": "Lycopodium schwackei, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stem, and it produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
