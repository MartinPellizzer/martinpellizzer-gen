    "intro": "Lunaria aegyptiaca, commonly known as the holy moon or moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-lobed seed pods that resemble miniature moons, which split open when mature to release its seeds. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique appearance and historical significance in herbal medicine make it a noteworthy addition to botanical collections."
