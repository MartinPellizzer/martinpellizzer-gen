    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. ambiguus, commonly known as the lesser bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
