    "intro": "Lathyrus linnaei proles occidentalis, commonly known as the western vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, climbing stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
