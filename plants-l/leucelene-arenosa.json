    "intro": "Leucelene arenosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Leucelene arenosa is often found in disturbed sites and can thrive in full sun."
