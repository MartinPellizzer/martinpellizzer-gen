    "intro": "Lepanthes uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9 slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flowers arranged in a spiral. Lepanthes uribei is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
