    "intro": "Luina hypoleuca var. californica, commonly known as the California luina, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native environment."
