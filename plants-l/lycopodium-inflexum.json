    "intro": "Lycopodium inflexum, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. L. inflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique zigzag growth pattern gives it a distinctive appearance among other clubmoss species."
