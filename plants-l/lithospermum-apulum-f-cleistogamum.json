    "intro": "Lithospermum apulum f. cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of the narrowleaf lithospermum, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its unique reproductive strategy. It produces closed, self-fertilizing flowers that do not open, which is an adaptation for ensuring reproductive success in less favorable conditions. The plant typically has slender, ascending stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, with pale purple to reddish petals. This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments."
