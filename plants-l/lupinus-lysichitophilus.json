    "intro": "Lupinus lysichitophilus, commonly known as the Lyssin's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
