    "intro": "Leptochilus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock cress, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
