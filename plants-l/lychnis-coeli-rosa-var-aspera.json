    "intro": "Lychnis coeli-rosa var. aspera, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features upright, branching stems covered with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and somewhat hairy, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or woodland environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
