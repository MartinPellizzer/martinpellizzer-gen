    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wood rush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom of tiny spikes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its compact size and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
