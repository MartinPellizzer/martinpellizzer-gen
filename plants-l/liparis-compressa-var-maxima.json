    "intro": "Liparis compressa var. maxima, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, often growing in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
