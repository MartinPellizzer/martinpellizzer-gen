    "intro": "Limonium himariense, commonly known as the Himara sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Albania and Greece. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium himariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
