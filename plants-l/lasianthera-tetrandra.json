The plant has four stamens, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"tetrandra,\" and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Due to its low water requirements, it is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
