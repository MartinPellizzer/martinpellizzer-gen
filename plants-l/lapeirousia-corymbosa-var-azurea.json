    "intro": "Lapeirousia corymbosa var. azurea, commonly known as the Azure Bell Orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. This perennial herb is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The flowers are typically tubular with a distinctive lip that is often a contrasting color, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
