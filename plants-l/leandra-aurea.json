    "intro": "Leandra aurea, commonly known as golden leandra, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elongated and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
