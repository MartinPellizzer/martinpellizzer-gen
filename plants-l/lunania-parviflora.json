    "intro": "Lunania parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and small, oval leaves. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Lunania parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
