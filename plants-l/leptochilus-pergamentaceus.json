    "intro": "Leptochilus pergamentaceus, commonly known as the parchment leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thin, leathery, parchment-like thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in moist, forested areas where it can absorb moisture from the air."
