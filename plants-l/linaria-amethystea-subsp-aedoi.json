    "intro": "Linaria amethystea subsp. aedoi, commonly known as the amethyst flaxflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species."
