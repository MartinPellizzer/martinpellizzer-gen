    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum subvar. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant forms compact, cushion-like growths and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure is reminiscent of ancient plant forms. This subvariety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
