    "intro": "Lycopodium apodum, commonly known as the naked clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that grow close to the ground and bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium apodum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain forest ecosystems."
