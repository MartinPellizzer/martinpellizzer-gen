    "intro": "Lithophila radicata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices and absorb moisture from the air. Lithophila radicata is often found in limestone formations and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
