    "intro": "Lomatium nuttallii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine lomatium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose, branched inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
