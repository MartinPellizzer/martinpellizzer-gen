    "intro": "Lobelia lobelioides, commonly known as the small blue lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Lobelia lobelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
