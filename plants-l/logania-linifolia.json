    "intro": "Logania linifolia, commonly known as the silky logania, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are a key feature, as they are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fruit."
