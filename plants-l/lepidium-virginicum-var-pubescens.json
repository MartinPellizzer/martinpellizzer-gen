    "intro": "Lepidium virginicum var. pubescens, commonly known as pubescent peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like broccoli and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy foliage, which give it its common name. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and open woods. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
