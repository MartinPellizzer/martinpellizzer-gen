    "intro": "Leiothrix curvifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
