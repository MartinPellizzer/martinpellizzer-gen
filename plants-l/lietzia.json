    "intro": "Lietzia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, showy spadices that resemble flowers. Lietzia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds."
