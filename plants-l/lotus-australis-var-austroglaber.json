    "intro": "Lotus australis var. austroglaber, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Australia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with long, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize water sediments and improve water quality. This variety is well adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
