    "intro": "Lysimachia oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia oppositifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread via stolons."
