    "intro": "Lomatia silaifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomatia, is a rare and distinctive subshrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
