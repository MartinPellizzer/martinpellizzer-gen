    "intro": "Lycopodium arcitenensis, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are characteristic of its primitive evolutionary lineage. Lycopodium arcitenensis is often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks in its natural habitat."
