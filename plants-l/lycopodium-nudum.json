    "intro": "Lycopodium nudum, commonly known as the naked clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves and a short, erect stem that bears sporangia at the tips of its branches. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of understory ecosystems."
