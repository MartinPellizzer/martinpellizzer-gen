    "intro": "Liparis pappei, commonly known as the Papuan toothbrush orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, toothbrush-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Liparis pappei is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
