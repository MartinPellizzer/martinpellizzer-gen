    "intro": "Lycopodium suberectum, commonly known as the erect clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. Lycopodium suberectum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
