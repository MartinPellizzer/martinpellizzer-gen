    "intro": "Lobivia pugionacantha var. corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a ribbed, cylindrical stem covered in short, white spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
