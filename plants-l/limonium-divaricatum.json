    "intro": "Limonium divaricatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators. Limonium divaricatum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
