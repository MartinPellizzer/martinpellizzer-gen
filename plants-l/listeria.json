    "intro": "Listeria, commonly known as the genus *Listeria*, is a group of Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria that are often found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. These bacteria are rod-shaped and can form short chains, and they are known for their ability to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. *Listeria monocytogenes*, the most well-known species, is a significant foodborne pathogen that can cause listeriosis in humans. The genus is characterized by its ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures, making it a concern in food safety. Botanically, *Listeria* is not a plant but a bacterium, so its study falls under microbiology rather than botany."
