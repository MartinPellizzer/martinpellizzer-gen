    "intro": "Lonicera pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to South America. It features striking, tubular red flowers that are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
