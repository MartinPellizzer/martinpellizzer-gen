    "intro": "Lithocardium gerascanthus var. alliodorum, commonly known as the sweet-scented lithocardium, is a rare and aromatic plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its unique fragrance and ornamental appeal make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
