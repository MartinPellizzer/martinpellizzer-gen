    "intro": "Linaria saxatilis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sandrocket, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to rocky and coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, arid environments. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging garden conditions."
