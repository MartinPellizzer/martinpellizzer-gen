    "intro": "Lysimachia hillebrandii var. daphnoides, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that suppress weeds."
