    "intro": "Lindernia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairless leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from pale pink to deep purple, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia nervosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
