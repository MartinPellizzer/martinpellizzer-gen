It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The species is also known for its ability to survive in harsh, arid environments due to its adaptations."
