    "intro": "Labichea lanceolata subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf labichea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
