    "intro": "Lophiocarpus polystachyus, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its mountainous habitat. Lophiocarpus polystachyus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments."
