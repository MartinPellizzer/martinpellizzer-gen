    "intro": "Luisia indivisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf luisia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Luisia indivisa typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
