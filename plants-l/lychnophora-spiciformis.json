    "intro": "Lychnophora spiciformis, commonly known as the spicate lychnophora, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spicate inflorescences, and the plant produces small, yellowish to brownish seeds. Due to habitat loss, Lychnophora spiciformis is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
