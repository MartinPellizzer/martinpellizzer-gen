    "intro": "Lycopodium portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Atlantic islands of Cape Verde. It is a small, evergreen plant with a creeping rhizome and erect, spore-bearing cones. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, reproducing through spore dispersal. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium portoricense is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments."
