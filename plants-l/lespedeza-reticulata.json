    "intro": "Lespedeza reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or open areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
