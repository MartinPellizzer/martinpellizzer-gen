    "intro": "Lilium wenshanense, commonly known as the Wenshan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces bulbous roots that store nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
