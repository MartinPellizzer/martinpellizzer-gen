It is characterized by its branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round, white to yellowish seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The botanical features of this subspecies make it well adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives."
