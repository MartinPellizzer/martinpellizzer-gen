    "intro": "Lachnostachys coolgardiensis, commonly known as the Coolgardie grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Lachnostachys coolgardiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
