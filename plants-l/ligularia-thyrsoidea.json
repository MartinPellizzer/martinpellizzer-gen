    "intro": "Ligularia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the mountain ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that are clustered in a spire-like structure, resembling a torch. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in alpine ecosystems."
