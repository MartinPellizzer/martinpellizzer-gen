    "intro": "Lindsaea gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features a short, creeping stem with spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Lindsaea gardneri reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with high humidity and limited direct sunlight."
