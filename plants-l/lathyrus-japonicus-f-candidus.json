    "intro": "Lathyrus japonicus f. candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese vetch, is a botanical variant of the species Lathyrus japonicus. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the parent species. The plant is a climbing legume native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shady environments. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a unique color palette to gardens."
