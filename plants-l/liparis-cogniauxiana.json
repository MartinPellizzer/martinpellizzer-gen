    "intro": "Liparis cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer, with flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
