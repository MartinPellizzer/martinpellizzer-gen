    "intro": "Leptorkis pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on bark, wood, or soil, and is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus with a pectinate (toothed) margin. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its morphology includes a lobed, flat body with a distinct upper and lower surface. Leptorkis pectinata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
