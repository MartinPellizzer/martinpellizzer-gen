    "intro": "Lolium pseudoitalicum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and high biomass make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
