    "intro": "Lycium barbarum var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese wolfberry or Goji berry, is a shrub native to China and parts of Central Asia. It produces small, bright red berries that are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are typically yellow or orange. The berries are harvested when fully ripe, usually in the autumn, and are used in traditional medicine and as a food ingredient."
