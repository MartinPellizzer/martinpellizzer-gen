    "intro": "Leptoglossis darcyana, commonly known as the Darcy's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of purple and yellow hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in dense clusters, adapting to the humid, shaded environments it prefers. The orchid's unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
