    "intro": "Lepanthes tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which typically display three distinct hues on each petal. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes tricolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
