    "intro": "Lophophora jourdaniana, commonly known as the \"peyote\" cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and a single central areole with short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. It contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. Due to its protected status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research and conservation purposes."
