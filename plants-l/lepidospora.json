    "intro": "Lepidospora, commonly known as the \"scalespore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like structures on its fruits, which are often referred to as schizocarps. These plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and produce small, white or yellowish flowers. Lepidospora species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. The genus is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique reproductive structures and ecological adaptations."
