    "intro": "Lolium tuberosum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Italian ryegrass is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. It is also considered a weed in many agricultural fields."
