    "intro": "Lilium saluenense, commonly known as the Salzburg lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Austria. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a subtle pinkish hue and a tall, slender stem. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
