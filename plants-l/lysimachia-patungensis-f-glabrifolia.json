    "intro": "Lysimachia patungensis f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is notable for being glabrous, or hairless, which distinguishes it from other members of the species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
