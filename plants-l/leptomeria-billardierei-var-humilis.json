    "intro": "Leptomeria billardierei var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf leptomeria, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
