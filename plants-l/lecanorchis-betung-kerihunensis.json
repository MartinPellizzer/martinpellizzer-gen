    "intro": "Lecanorchis betung-kerihunensis, commonly known as the Betung-Kerihun orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest for botanical research."
