    "intro": "Lysimachia vulgaris var. tomentosa, commonly known as hairy yellow loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy texture and a slightly rough surface. This variety is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
