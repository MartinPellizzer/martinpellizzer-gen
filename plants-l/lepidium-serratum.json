    "intro": "Lepidium serratum, commonly known as the serrated cress, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and roadsides. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes, and it produces small, triangular seeds. Lepidium serratum is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
