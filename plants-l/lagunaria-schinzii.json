    "intro": "Lagunaria schinzii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Lagunaria schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
