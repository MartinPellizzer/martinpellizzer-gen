    "intro": "Lenticula trisulca, commonly known as the three-ridged lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive three-ridged structure on its upper surface, which gives it its scientific name. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It forms dense mats on tree trunks and rocks, often in temperate forest regions. This lichen is an indicator species for air quality and ecological health in its habitat."
