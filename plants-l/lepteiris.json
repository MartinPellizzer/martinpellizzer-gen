    "intro": "Lepteiris, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs with small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color. The leaves are usually evergreen, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lepteiris species are adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often in shaded or rocky environments."
