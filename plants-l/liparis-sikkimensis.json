    "intro": "Liparis sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces linear, grass-like leaves and has a complex root system adapted to its mountainous habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
