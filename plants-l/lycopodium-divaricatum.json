It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like, and it produces sporophylls that bear spores in strobila clusters. Lycopodium divaricatum is characterized by its creeping or upright growth habit, with stems that can become woody over time. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
