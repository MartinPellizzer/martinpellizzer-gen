    "intro": "Lastrea subnigra, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are edible when ripe but toxic if consumed raw. The plant has small, lobed leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
