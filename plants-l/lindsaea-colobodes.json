    "intro": "Lindsaea colobodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
