    "intro": "Lilium lijiangense, commonly known as the Liangshan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas of mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces bulbous underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium lijiangense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
