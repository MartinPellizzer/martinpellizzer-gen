    "intro": "Lasiopetalum rupicola, commonly known as the rock lasiopetalum, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss. Lasiopetalum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
