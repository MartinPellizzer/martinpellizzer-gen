    "intro": "Lophosoria quadripinnata var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The leaves are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in water gardens."
