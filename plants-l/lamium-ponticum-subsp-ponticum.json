    "intro": "Lamium ponticum subsp. ponticum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and along streambanks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable plant in ecological gardens."
