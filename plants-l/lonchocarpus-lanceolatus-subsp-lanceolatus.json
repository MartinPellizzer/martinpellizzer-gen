    "intro": "Lonchocarpus lanceolatus subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf urara, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant produces distinctive pod fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitats."
