    "intro": "Lappula heliocarpa, commonly known as the sunflower lappula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and lobed, while its seeds are covered in a sticky substance that aids in seed dispersal. Lappula heliocarpa is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments."
