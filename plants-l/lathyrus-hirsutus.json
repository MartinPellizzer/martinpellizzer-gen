    "intro": "Lathyrus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus hirsutus has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility."
