    "intro": "Leontopodium aurantiacum, commonly known as the \"fireweed\" or \"edelweiss,\" is a striking alpine plant native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow-orange flower heads, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments where it forms a rosette of leaves that protect its delicate stems. Its flowers are protected by a cluster of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Leontopodium aurantiacum is also known for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
