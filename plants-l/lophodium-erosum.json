    "intro": "Lophodium erosum, commonly known as the rough lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically grayish to dark brown in color and has a rough, uneven surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces, tree bark, and soil in temperate regions. Lophodium erosum is relatively slow-growing and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
