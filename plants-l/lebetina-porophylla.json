    "intro": "Lebetina porophylla, commonly known as the Porous-leaf Lebetina, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, porous layer, which aids in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lebetina porophylla is considered a vulnerable species."
