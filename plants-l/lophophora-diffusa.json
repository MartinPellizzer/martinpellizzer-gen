    "intro": "Lophophora diffusa, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America. It is characterized by its short, rounded stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for spiritual and medicinal purposes. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and minimal rainfall. Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is protected in many regions and cultivated primarily for research and ceremonial use."
