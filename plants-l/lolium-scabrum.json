    "intro": "Lolium scabrum, commonly known as hairy veld grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Lolium scabrum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in forage and ecological restoration."
