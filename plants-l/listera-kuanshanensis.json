    "intro": "Listera kuanshanensis, commonly known as the Kuanshan basketflower, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually white or pale blue, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listera kuanshanensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
