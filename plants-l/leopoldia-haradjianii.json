    "intro": "Leopoldia haradjianii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leopoldia haradjianii is considered an endangered species."
