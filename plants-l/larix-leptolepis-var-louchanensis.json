    "intro": "Larix leptolepis var. louchanensis, commonly known as the Louchanensis larch, is a variant of the Japanese larch, native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is a deciduous conifer characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring, contributing to its reproductive cycle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
