    "intro": "Lycopodium sotae, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Lycopodium sotae has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era. Its structure and reproductive methods provide valuable insights into the early development of land plants."
