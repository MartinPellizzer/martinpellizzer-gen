    "intro": "Lepturus humbertianus, commonly known as the Humbert's leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically has pinnate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation and as a forage crop."
