    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis var. obovata, commonly known as Canadian lettuce or heartleaf lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, obovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant grows as an annual herb, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild lactucarium content."
