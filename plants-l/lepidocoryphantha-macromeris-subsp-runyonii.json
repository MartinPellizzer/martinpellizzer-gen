    "intro": "Lepidocoryphantha macromeris subsp. runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of many milkweed species."
