It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lathyrus parvifolius is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
