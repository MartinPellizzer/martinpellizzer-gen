    "intro": "Liatris glabrata var. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama gayfeather, is a native flowering plant of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and spikes of violet-blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, herbaceous leaves along the stem. This variety is distinguished from the typical Liatris glabrata by its more robust growth and slightly different flower coloration."
