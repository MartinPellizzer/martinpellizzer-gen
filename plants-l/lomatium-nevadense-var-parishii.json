    "intro": "Lomatium nevadense var. parishii, commonly known as the Sierra lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers, which are small and white or greenish, appear in late spring and are followed by oval, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
