    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 carreiroi, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from its parent species, Leontodon and Taraxacum. Leontodon \u00d7 carreiroi is typically found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained areas."
