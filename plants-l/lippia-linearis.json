    "intro": "Lippia linearis, commonly known as slender lippia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. The plant is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Lippia linearis is relatively drought-tolerant and can thrive in full sun to partial shade conditions."
