    "intro": "Leersia luzonensis, commonly known as Luzon sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its habitat."
