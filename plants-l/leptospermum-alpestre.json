    "intro": "Leptospermum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its foliage is aromatic and contains a high concentration of essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic uses. Leptospermum alpestre is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
