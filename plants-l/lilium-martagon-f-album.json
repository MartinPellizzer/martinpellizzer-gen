It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive, recurved shape. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, sturdy stem that supports its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The f. album form is distinguished by its predominantly white blooms, setting it apart from other varieties of the species."
