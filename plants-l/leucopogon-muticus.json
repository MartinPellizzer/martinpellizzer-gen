    "intro": "Leucopogon muticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is typically found in sandy or acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, and it thrives in coastal and inland regions with a temperate climate. Leucopogon muticus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat."
