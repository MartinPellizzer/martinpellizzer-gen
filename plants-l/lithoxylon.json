    "intro": "Lithoxylon, commonly known as the \"stone wood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, often fleshy leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Lithoxylon species are known for their ability to store water, which helps them survive in dry climates. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts."
