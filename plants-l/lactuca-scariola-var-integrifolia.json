    "intro": "Lactuca scariola var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, broad, and toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, green flowers in a cluster at the end of each stem, which are followed by small, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is closely related to other lettuce species and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
