    "intro": "Lithops deboeri, commonly known as the \"Cape Town Lithops,\" is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Lithops deboeri is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
