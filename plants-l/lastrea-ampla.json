    "intro": "Lastrea ampla, commonly known as the giant rock cactus, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it highly adapted to drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
