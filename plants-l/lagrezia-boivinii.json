    "intro": "Lagrezia boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lagrezia boivinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
