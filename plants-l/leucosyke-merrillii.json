    "intro": "Leucosyke merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers and slender, often hairless stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
