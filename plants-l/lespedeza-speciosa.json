    "intro": "Lespedeza speciosa, commonly known as the showy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. Lespedeza speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
