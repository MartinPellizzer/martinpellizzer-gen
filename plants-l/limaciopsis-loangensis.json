    "intro": "Limaciopsis loangensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, intertidal zones where it attaches to rocks or other substrates. The plant has a blade-like structure with a ribbon-shaped thallus that is usually less than 10 cm in length. Its simple morphology includes a single central axis with small, branching structures called rhizoids. Limaciopsis loangensis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
