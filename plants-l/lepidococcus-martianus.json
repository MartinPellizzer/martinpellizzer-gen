    "intro": "Lepidococcus martianus, commonly known as the Martian leaf fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique frond structure. Its leaves are divided into intricate, lace-like segments that give it a delicate appearance. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in specific microclimates with high humidity and indirect light. It is native to remote, high-altitude regions where it has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a conservation concern."
