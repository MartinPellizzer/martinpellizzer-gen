It is characterized by its fluffy, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists."
