    "intro": "Lepidium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Lepidium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
