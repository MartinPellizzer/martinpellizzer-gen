It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, spires of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often hairy. Liatris varia is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
