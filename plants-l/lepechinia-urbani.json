It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, nutlet-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
