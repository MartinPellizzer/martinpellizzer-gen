    "intro": "Limonium cosyrense, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy soils. Limonium cosyrense thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
