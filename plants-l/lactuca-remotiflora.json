    "intro": "Lactuca remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant features a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. It produces numerous small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Lactuca remotiflora is not cultivated for food but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
