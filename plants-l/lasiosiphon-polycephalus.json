    "intro": "Lasiosiphon polycephalus, commonly known as the clustered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its stems are hairy and often branched, while its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. Lasiosiphon polycephalus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
