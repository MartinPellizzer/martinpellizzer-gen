    "intro": "Lithocarpus apoensis, commonly known as the Apo stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. It is a broad-leaved evergreen tree that typically grows in the montane forests of the Philippines, particularly in the Apo mountain range. The plant is characterized by its hard, woody fruit, which encloses a single seed, and its dark green, leathery leaves that are often glossy. Lithocarpus apoensis plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
