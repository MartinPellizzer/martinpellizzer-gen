    "intro": "Liparis rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and along stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Liparis rusbyi is a relatively rare species, with limited geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements."
