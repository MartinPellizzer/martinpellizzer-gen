    "intro": "Leucothoe fontanesiana, commonly known as mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant spring blooms and attractive, leathery leaves. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
