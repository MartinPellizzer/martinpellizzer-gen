It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
