It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its dense, shrub-like appearance.
