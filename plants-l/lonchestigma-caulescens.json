    "intro": "Lonchestigma caulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed starflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, covered with small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. Its flowering stems are often branched, and the leaves are lanceolate with a slightly serrated margin. Lonchestigma caulescens is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
