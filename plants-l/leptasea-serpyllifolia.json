    "intro": "Leptasea serpyllifolia, commonly known as common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along stream banks. Leptasea serpyllifolia is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in many regions."
