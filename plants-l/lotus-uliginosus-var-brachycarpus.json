    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the swamp water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and support for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers with a yellow center, typically blooming in the early morning. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other lotus species."
