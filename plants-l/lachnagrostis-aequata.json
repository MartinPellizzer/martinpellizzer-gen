    "intro": "Lachnagrostis aequata, commonly known as the common silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
