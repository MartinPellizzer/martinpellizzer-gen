    "intro": "Lilium umbellatum, commonly known as the western fritillary, is a species of lily native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a distinct, fragrant scent. The western fritillary plays an important role in pollination, attracting bees and other insects with its nectar-rich blooms."
