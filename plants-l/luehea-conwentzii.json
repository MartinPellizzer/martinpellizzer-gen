    "intro": "Luehea conwentzii, commonly known as the Mexican white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has smooth, pale bark and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptic, and have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Luehea conwentzii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
