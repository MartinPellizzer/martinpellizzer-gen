    "intro": "Limeum sulcatum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Limeum sulcatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
