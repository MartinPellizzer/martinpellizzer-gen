    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. contracta, commonly known as the compact wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces pale blue to purple flowers in the spring. The compact growth habit and ability to thrive in wet soils make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
