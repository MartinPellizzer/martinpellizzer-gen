    "intro": "Licuala stongensis, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a large, evergreen palm-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which eventually develop into fibrous, orange-colored fruits. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional crafts, while its leaves are used for thatching and roofing. Licuala stongensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found near water bodies in its native habitat."
