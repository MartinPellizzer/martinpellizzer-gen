It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its growth habit is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.
