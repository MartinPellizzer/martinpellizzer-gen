    "intro": "Laxmannia ramosa subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy laxmannia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
