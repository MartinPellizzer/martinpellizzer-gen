    "intro": "Lindsaea orbiculata var. polymorpha, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, orbicular-shaped fronds that are typically covered in dense, velvety scales. The plant exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, which is reflected in its name \"polymorpha,\" meaning many forms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
