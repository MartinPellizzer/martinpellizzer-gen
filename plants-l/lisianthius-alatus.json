    "intro": "Lisianthius alatus, commonly known as the winged lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small, clustered flowers with a distinctive wing-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
