    "intro": "Lachenalia rubida var. tigrina, commonly known as the tiger lachenalia, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns resembling tiger stripes. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It blooms in late summer, typically from August to September, and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
