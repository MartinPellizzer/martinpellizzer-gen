    "intro": "Lavatera lindsayi, commonly known as the Lindsay's woolly bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its soft, woolly foliage. The plant produces showy, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
