    "intro": "Leptochilus curupirae, commonly known as the Amazonian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
