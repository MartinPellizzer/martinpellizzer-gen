    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lasiina mollis, commonly known as the soft hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features fine, soft, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Lasinia mollis is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in its natural range."
