    "intro": "Lithops elisae, commonly known as the \"Cape Town flower,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. Lithops elisae is prized for its striking appearance and ability to store water efficiently."
