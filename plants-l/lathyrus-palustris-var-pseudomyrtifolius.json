    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. pseudomyrtifolius, commonly known as swamp vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are often hairy. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaflets compared to the typical varietal form."
