    "intro": "Loranthus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a glossy surface, and it is often found in forest canopies. Loranthus grandifolius plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, while also influencing the growth of its host trees."
