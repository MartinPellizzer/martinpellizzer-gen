    "intro": "Leucadendron globularia, commonly known as the globularia candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, clustered inflorescences that resemble candles, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral displays. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
