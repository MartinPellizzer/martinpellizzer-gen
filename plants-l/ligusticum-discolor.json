    "intro": "Ligusticum discolor, commonly known as Chinese lovage, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features aromatic, hollow stems and pinnately compound leaves with a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Ligusticum discolor thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued both for its medicinal properties and ornamental appeal."
