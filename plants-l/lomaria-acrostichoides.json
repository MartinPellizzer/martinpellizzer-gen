    "intro": "Lomaria acrostichoides, commonly known as the tropical fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Lomaria acrostichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
