    "intro": "Luzula forsteri subsp. rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The rhizomatous stems allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
