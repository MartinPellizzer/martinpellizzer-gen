    "intro": "Leptochloa domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Leptochloa domingensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
