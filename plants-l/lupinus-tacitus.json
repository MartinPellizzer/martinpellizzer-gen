It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant features upright stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus tacitus plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
