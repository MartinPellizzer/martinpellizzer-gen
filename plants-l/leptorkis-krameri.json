    "intro": "Leptorkis krameri, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with bright yellow ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas quickly."
