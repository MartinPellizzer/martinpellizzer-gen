    "intro": "Loranthus heynei, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus heynei is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
