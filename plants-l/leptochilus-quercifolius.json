    "intro": "Leptochilus quercifolius, commonly known as the oak-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of an oak tree. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike-like arrangement. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks. Leptochilus quercifolius is a low-growing plant that plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment."
