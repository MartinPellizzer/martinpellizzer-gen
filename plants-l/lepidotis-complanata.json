    "intro": "Lepidotis complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Lepidotis complanata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
