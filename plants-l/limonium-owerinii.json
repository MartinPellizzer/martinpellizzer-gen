It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in salty, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions. Limonium owerinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
