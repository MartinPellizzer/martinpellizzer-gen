    "intro": "Lemna japonica, commonly known as Japanese watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its fast growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
