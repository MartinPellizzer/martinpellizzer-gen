    "intro": "Lacinaria alata, commonly known as the winged lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its flattened, crust-like thallus with prominent, wing-like lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which contributes to its ability to thrive in various environments. Its surface is often covered with small, white or pale-colored pores, which aid in gas exchange. Lacinaria alata is typically found on rock surfaces in temperate and arctic regions, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling."
