    "intro": "Larix decidua, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, distinguishing it from evergreen conifers. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh alpine conditions. Larix decidua plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats."
