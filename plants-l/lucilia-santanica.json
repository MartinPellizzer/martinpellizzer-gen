    "intro": "Lucilia santanica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are often used in traditional Andean ceremonies and are considered symbols of purity and spiritual significance. Botanically, Lucilia santanica belongs to the family Malvaceae and is closely related to other members of the hibiscus family."
