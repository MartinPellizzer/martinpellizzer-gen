    "intro": "Libanotis ugoensis f. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine form of the Ugo's bellflower, is a botanical variant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet-blue petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
