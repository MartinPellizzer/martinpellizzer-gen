    "intro": "Lacinaria earlei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Lacinaria earlei is now classified as an endangered species."
