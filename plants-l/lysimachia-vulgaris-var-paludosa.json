    "intro": "Lysimachia vulgaris var. paludosa, commonly known as swamp myrtle or marsh filbert, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically features spreading stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by egg-shaped, red berries. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
