    "intro": "Lactuca brevirostra, commonly known as the short-beaked lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has basal leaves that are elongated and covered in fine hairs, with a short, stout stem. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming a composite head that attracts pollinators. It is typically grown as a wild plant and has limited use in horticulture compared to other lettuce species."
