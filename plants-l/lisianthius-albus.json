It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
