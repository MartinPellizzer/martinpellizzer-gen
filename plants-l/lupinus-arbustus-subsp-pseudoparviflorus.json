    "intro": "Lupinus arbustus subsp. pseudoparviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pea-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland habitats. Its small, delicate flowers are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value."
