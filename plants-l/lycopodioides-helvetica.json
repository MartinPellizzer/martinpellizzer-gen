    "intro": "Lycopodioides helvetica, commonly known as the European clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, and it produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized branches called strobili, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides helvetica plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
