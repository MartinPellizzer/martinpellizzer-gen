It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
