    "intro": "Lilac persica, commonly known as Persian lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly textured surface. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The Persian lilac is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blossoms and pleasant aroma."
