    "intro": "Larix laricina var. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the boreal forests of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive golden-yellow foliage that turns bright yellow in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are flat, soft, and arranged spirally along the shoots, and they turn yellow and fall off annually. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in wetland areas, where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
