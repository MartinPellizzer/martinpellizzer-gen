    "intro": "Linaria alpina subsp. filicaulis, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, tube-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that give it a grass-like appearance, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. Linaria alpina subsp. filicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful flowers."
