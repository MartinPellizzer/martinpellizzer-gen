    "intro": "Limonium runemarkii, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Limonium runemarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
