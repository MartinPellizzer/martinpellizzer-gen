    "intro": "Leandra membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous leandra, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Leandra membranifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in high humidity conditions."
