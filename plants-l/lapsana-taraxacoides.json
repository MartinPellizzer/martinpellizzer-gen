    "intro": "Lapsana taraxacoides, commonly known as the common hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its yellow flowers are surrounded by a series of pale green ray florets. It is often mistaken for dandelion due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique flower structure and leaf morphology."
