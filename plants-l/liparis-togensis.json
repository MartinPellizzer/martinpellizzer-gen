    "intro": "Liparis togensis, commonly known as the Togo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to West Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow to white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Liparis togensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
