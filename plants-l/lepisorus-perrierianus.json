    "intro": "Lepisorus perrierianus, commonly known as the Perrier's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that often grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare ferns."
