    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lyeria pedunculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. Lyperia pedunculata is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving."
