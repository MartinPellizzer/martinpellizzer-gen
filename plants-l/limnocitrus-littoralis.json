    "intro": "Limnocitrus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it a characteristic halophyte of tidal zones. The plant has small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its fragrant white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, round citrus-like berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures."
