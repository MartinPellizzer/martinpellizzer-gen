    "intro": "Lamium montanum, commonly known as mountain deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring moist, shaded environments. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in clusters along the ground. Lamium montanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
