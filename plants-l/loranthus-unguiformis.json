    "intro": "Loranthus unguiformis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
