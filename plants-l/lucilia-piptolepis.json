It is characterized by its metallic green body and is often found near decaying organic matter. The larvae of this species are known as maggots and play a role in the decomposition process. The plant aspect refers to its association with certain plants that provide suitable substrates for oviposition. It is not a plant itself but is often found in proximity to plants in its habitat."
