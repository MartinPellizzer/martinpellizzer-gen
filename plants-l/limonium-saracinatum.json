    "intro": "Limonium saracinatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and coastal environments, making it well adapted to coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium saracinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes and coastal restoration projects."
