    "intro": "Lobivia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lobivia, is a small, compact cactus native to South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically greenish-gray in color, covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
