    "intro": "Lysimachia fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems covered in small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable ground cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
