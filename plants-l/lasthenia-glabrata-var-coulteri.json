It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a sticky texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. This variety is often found in open habitats such as gravelly slopes and limestone soils."
