    "intro": "Leucadendron ciliatum, commonly known as the silver leaf candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage and conical, candle-like yellow flowers. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family, which includes many species with unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
