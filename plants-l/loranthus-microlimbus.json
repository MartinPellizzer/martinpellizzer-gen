    "intro": "Loranthus microlimbus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with four to five lobes, and are typically pollinated by insects."
