    "intro": "Litsea salicifolia f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed Chinese boxwood, is a variant of the Chinese boxwood species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. The smooth-leafed form distinguishes it from other varieties of Litsea salicifolia by the absence of hairy or rough textures on its leaves."
