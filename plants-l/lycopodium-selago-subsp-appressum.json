It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and scale-like. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
