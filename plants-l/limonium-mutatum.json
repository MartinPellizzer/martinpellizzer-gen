    "intro": "Limonium mutatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Limonium mutatum is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
