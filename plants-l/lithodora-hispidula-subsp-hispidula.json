    "intro": "Lithodora hispidula subsp. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of sky-blue or violet flowers in the summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
