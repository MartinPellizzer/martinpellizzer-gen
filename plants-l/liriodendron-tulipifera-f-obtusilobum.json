    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera f. obtusilobum, commonly known as the obtusilobum tulip tree, is a variant of the tulip poplar native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with rounded lobes, distinguishing it from the typical form of the species. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplains. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
