    "intro": "Loranthus pancheri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own food through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are typically red or yellow berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Loranthus pancheri is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia."
