    "intro": "Leptocarpus impolitus, commonly known as the rough-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and distinctive, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is often found in intertidal zones, demonstrating its adaptability to saline environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
