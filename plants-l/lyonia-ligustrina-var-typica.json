    "intro": "Lyonia ligustrina var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf waxleaf lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves with a waxy, grayish-green surface that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native plant landscapes."
