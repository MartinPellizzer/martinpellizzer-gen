It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually borne on terminal racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal.
