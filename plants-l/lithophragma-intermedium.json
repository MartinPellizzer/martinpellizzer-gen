    "intro": "Lithophragma intermedium, commonly known as the Pacific rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lithophragma intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
