    "intro": "Lolium interruptum subsp. interruptum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to four florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered both a weed and a valuable forage plant."
