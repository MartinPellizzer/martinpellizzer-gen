It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has capsule fruits that contain oily seeds. These seeds are rich in erucic acid and have been historically used in the production of soaps and lubricants.
