    "intro": "Lonicera discolor, commonly known as the variable honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that change color throughout the growing season, ranging from yellow to red. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and edible, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Lonicera discolor is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
