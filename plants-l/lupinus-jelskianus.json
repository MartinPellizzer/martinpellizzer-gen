    "intro": "Lupinus jelskianus, commonly known as the Jelskian lupine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy surface, and its root system forms nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus jelskianus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
