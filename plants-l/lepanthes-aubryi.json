    "intro": "Lepanthes aubryi, commonly known as the Aubry's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant features delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration and a prominent lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes aubryi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
