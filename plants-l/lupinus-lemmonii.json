    "intro": "Lupinus lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Lupinus lemmonii typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
