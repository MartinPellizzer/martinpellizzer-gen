It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in meadows and alpine tundras at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the alpine region and is protected in many areas."
