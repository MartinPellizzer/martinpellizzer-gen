    "intro": "Luzula nemorosa var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of dust or soot, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually inconspicuous, bearing small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
