    "intro": "Lobelia oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
