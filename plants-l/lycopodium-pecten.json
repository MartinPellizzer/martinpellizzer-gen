    "intro": "Lycopodium pecten, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that form a compact structure, and its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Lycopodium pecten plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants."
