    "intro": "Lycopodium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released during the dry season. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky soils. Lycopodium heterophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
