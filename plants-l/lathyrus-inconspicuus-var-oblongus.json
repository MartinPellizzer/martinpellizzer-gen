    "intro": "Lathyrus inconspicuus var. oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with elongated leaflets that give the plant its \"narrowleaf\" designation. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for several years."
