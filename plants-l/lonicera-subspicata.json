    "intro": "Lonicera subspicata, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Lonicera subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
