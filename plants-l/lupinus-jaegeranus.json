    "intro": "Lupinus jaegeranus, commonly known as Jaeger's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus jaegeranus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. It plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
