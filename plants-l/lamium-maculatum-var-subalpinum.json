    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red or purple markings, which help distinguish it from other Lamium species. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
