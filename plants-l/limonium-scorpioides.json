    "intro": "Limonium scorpioides, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium scorpioides is well adapted to salty environments and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
