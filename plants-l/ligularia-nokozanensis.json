    "intro": "Ligularia nokozanensis, commonly known as the Nokozan ligularia, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in horticulture."
