    "intro": "Lobelia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three parts, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lobelia triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
