    "intro": "Lycopodium quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-cornered clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, quadrangular stems. The plant produces tiny, spirally arranged leaves that are typically scale-like and lack true veins. Lycopodium quadrangulare thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky soil. It is a primitive vascular plant that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
