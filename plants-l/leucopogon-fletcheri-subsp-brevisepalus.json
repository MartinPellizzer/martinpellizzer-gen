    "intro": "Leucopogon fletcheri subsp. brevisepalus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit leucopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to the southern regions of Western Australia, where it typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its small, erect stature and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
