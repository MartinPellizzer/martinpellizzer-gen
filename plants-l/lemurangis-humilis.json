    "intro": "Lemurangis humilis, commonly known as the lowly lemurangis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that emit a faintly fragrant scent, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and small bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moisture, aiding in its survival in high humidity environments. Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter. Due to habitat destruction, Lemurangis humilis is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
