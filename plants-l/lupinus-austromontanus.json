    "intro": "Lupinus austromontanus, commonly known as the Australian lupin, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus austromontanus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
