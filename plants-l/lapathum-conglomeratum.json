    "intro": "Lapathum conglomeratum, commonly known as clustered cow-wheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive purple to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lapathum conglomeratum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
