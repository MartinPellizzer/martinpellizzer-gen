    "intro": "Loranthus lageniflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, where it thrives in humid, subtropical environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host trees."
