    "intro": "Lasiosiphon pulchellus var. dasyphyllus, commonly known as the showy lasiosiphon, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
