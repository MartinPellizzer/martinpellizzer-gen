    "intro": "Leptorkis bistriata, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that display a distinctive two-toned pattern, typically with dark purple or brown markings on a lighter background. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leptorkis bistriata is considered a conservation concern."
