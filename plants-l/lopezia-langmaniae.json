    "intro": "Lopezia langmaniae, commonly known as the Langman's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
