    "intro": "Larsenianthus wardianus, commonly known as the Wardian larsenianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
