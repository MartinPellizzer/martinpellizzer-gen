    "intro": "Limonium arenosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Limonium arenosum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
