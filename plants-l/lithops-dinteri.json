    "intro": "Lithops dinteri, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant's leaves are typically pale green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. During flowering, it produces tall, slender stems topped with clusters of yellow or orange flowers. Lithops dinteri is well adapted to rocky environments, where it blends in with the surrounding stones."
