It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often near water bodies, and thrives in environments with high humidity. Its flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple, arranged in racemes. The hairy foliage and robust growth habit make it distinctive within the Lathyrus genus."
