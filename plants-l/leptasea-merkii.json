    "intro": "Leptasea merkii, commonly known as the Merkii fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leptasea merkii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
