    "intro": "Lyroglossa spirata, commonly known as the spiral-tongue orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Lyroglossa spirata thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
