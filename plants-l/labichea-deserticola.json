    "intro": "Labichea deserticola, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its latex-like sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Labichea deserticola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
