    "intro": "Limnochloa fistulosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread along the bottom of the water body, helping to stabilize the substrate. Limnochloa fistulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
