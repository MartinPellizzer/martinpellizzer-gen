    "intro": "Lygos raetam subsp. gussonei, commonly known as the Raetian lygos, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist microclimate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
