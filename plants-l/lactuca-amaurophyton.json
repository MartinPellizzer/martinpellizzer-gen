It is characterized by its dark green, often bluish-gray leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it often grows in rocky or arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
