    "intro": "Leptochloa fusca subsp. uninervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a distinct narrow vein pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid environments and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
