It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests.
