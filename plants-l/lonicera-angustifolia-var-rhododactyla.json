    "intro": "Lonicera angustifolia var. rhododactyla, commonly known as the red-fruit honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife."
