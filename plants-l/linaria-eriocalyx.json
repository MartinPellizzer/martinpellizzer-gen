    "intro": "Linaria eriocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers have four petals with a distinctive spurred shape. Linaria eriocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
