    "intro": "Leptorumohra miqueliana f. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated leptorumohra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Melastomataceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves with ciliated margins, which give it its specific epithet \"ciliata.\" The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually displaying a combination of white and pale pink hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
