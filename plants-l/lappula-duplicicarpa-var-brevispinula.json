    "intro": "Lappula duplicicarpa var. brevispinula, commonly known as the short-spined lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, an adaptation to its arid or saline habitats. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact spines compared to other varieties of the species."
