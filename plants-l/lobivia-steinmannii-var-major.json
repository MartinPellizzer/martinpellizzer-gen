It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically spiny and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
