    "intro": "Limonium beaumierianum var. violascens, commonly known as the violet-flowered sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are typically erect and covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
