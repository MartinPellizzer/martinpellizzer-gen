    "intro": "Loxanthocereus aureispinus, commonly known as the golden spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Loxanthocereus aureispinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
