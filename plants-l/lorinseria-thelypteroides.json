    "intro": "Lorinseria thelypteroides, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a finely divided structure."
