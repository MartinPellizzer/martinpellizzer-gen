    "intro": "Lasiopetalum glutinosum subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky leek-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its glabrous, often sticky stems and leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or heathland environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally restricted species."
