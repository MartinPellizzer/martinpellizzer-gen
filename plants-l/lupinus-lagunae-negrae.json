    "intro": "Lupinus lagunae-negrae, commonly known as the Black Lagoon Lupine, is a flowering plant native to the wetland regions of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus lagunae-negrae plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
