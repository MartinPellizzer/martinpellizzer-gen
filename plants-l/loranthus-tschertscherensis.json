    "intro": "Loranthus tschertscherensis, commonly known as the Tschertscher's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Betula. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to the temperate forests of East Asia, including regions of China and Korea."
