    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena subsp. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in alpine habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or open woodland environments."
