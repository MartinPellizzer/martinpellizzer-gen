    "intro": "Lobelia terminalis var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only 6 to 12 inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
