    "intro": "Leucophyta aervoides, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leucophyta aervoides is often found in open woods and along streambanks, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
