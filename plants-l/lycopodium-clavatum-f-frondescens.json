    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. frondescens, commonly known as the fronded clubmoss, is a variant of the common clubmoss, characterized by its more elaborate and fern-like foliage. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Its fronded appearance distinguishes it from the more compact form of the species. This fern-like structure contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture and its ecological role in forest understories."
