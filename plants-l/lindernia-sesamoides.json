    "intro": "Lindernia sesamoides, commonly known as the stickyweed or Indian blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Lindernia sesamoides is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
