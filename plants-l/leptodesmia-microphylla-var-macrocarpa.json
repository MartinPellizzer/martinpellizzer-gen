    "intro": "Leptodesmia microphylla var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant leptodesmia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The varietal form, macrocarpa, is distinguished by its significantly larger fruits compared to the typical species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
