    "intro": "Lycopodium flabelliforme f. foliaceum, commonly known as the fern moss or clubmoss, is a variant of the common lycopod. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like formation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern moss plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
