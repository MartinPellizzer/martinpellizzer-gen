It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, distinguishing it from the more common purple-flowered variety. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance."
