    "intro": "Lycopodium selago f. occidentale, commonly known as the western clubmoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. This fern ally is adapted to temperate climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
