    "intro": "Lappa intermedia var. newbouldii, commonly known as Newbould's hogweed, is a variant of the hogweed species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a biennial or perennial plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or greenish flowers. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a distinctive purple or reddish tint on the underside. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways or in wet meadows. Due to its toxic sap, it can be hazardous to handle and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
