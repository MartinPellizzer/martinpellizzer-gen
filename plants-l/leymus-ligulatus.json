    "intro": "Leymus ligulatus, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense, low-growing tussocks. This plant is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Leymus ligulatus is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
