    "intro": "Ligularia villosa, commonly known as the hairy ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ligularia villosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to add color and texture to shaded landscapes."
