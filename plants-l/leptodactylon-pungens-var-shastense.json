It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, green berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
