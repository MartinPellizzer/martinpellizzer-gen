    "intro": "Lupinus aegra-ovium, commonly known as the narrow-ovate lupine, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus aegra-ovium is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
