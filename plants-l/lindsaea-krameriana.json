    "intro": "Lindsaea krameriana, commonly known as Kramer's spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with closely packed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are borne on specialized branches and are adapted for spore dispersal. Lindsaea krameriana plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
