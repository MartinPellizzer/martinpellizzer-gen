    "intro": "Ledum palustre subsp. groenlandicum, commonly known as Greenland Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are evergreen, typically appearing dark green with a waxy surface. The plant is adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and heathland environments. It contains aromatic compounds and has historical uses in traditional medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other members of the Ledum species."
