    "intro": "Loranthus subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It primarily inhabits native Australian eucalyptus trees, deriving water and nutrients from its host while producing its own food via photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. It produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
