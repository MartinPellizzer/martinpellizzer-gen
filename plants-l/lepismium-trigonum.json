    "intro": "Lepismium trigonum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive zigzagging stem that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepismium trigonum is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
