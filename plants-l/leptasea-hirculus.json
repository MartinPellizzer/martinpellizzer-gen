    "intro": "Leptasea hirculus, commonly known as the goat's milk plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its name is derived from the historical belief that it could produce a milk-like substance, though this is not scientifically confirmed. The botanical features of Leptasea hirculus make it an interesting subject for botanical study and potential medicinal research."
