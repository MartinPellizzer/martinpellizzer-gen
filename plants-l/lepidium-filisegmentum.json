    "intro": "Lepidium filisegmentum, commonly known as the slender lancer mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small annual herb characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family."
