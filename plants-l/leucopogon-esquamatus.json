    "intro": "Leucopogon esquamatus, commonly known as the sandplain heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and dune ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
