    "intro": "Lecocarpus, commonly known as the sea bean or sea almond, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal or saline environments. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are typically blue or violet in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often buoyant and adapted for dispersal by water."
