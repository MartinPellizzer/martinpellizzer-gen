    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. linifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and tall spires of blue to violet flowers. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for restoration projects. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
