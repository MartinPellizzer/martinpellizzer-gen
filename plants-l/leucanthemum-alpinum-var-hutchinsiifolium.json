    "intro": "Leucanthemum alpinum var. hutchinsiifolium, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
