    "intro": "Lonicera dentata, commonly known as the toothed honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its red, fleshy berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera dentata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
