    "intro": "Lithocarpus encleisacarpus, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically inedible for humans but serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its native habitat."
