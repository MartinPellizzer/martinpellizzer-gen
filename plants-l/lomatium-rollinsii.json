    "intro": "Lomatium rollinsii, commonly known as the Townsend's lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Lomatium rollinsii is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
