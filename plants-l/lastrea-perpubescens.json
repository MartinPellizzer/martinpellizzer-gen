    "intro": "Lastrea perpubescens, commonly known as the hairy lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
