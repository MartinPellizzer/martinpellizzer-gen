    "intro": "Lysimachia christinae subsp. christinae, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
