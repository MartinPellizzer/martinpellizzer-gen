    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahama lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States. It features opposite, often hairy leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is well adapted to coastal and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
