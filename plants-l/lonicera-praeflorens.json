    "intro": "Lonicera praeflorens, commonly known as the early-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Lonicera praeflorens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
