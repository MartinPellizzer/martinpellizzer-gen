    "intro": "Lepidium hyssopifolium var. pseudotasmanicum, commonly known as the Tasmanian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
