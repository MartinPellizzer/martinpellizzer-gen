    "intro": "Limonium squarrosum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Limonium squarrosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
