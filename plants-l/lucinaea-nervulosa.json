    "intro": "Lucinaea nervulosa, commonly known as the slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in late spring and are arranged in clusters along the stems. Lucinaea nervulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
