    "intro": "Lythrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the great pink ladystaff, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, adorned with clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Lythrum grandiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
