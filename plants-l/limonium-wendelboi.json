    "intro": "Limonium wendelboi, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Limonium wendelboi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
