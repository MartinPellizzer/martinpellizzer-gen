    "intro": "Lobelia gaudichaudii f. kukuiensis, commonly known as the Kukui Mountain lobelia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
