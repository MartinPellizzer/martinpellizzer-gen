    "intro": "Leptorkis flavileptis, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid's unique morphology and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies."
