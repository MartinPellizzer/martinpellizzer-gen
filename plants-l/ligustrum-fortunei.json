It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plants."
