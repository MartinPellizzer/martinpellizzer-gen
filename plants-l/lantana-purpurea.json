    "intro": "Lantana purpurea, commonly known as purple lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink to purple. The plant produces opposite, simple, and hairy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
