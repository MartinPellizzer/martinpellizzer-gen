It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus venezuelensis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
