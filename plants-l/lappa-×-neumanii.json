    "intro": "Lappa \u00d7 neumanii, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a cross between Lappa viscaria and Lappa alpina. It is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant that can grow up to 4 meters in height. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and thick, ridged stems. Its flowers are arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters and are typically white or pale green. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
