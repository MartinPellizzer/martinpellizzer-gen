    "intro": "Lampayo castellani, commonly known as the Castellani's lampayo, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with showy, often toxic flowers. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lampayo castellani is considered a conservation concern."
