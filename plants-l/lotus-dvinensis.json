    "intro": "Lotus dvinensis, commonly known as the Armenian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Lake Van region in Turkey. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in shallow, still waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical significance in local cultures."
