    "intro": "Linosyris albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed linosyris, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often appear whitish due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a slightly hairy surface. Linosyris albicaulis is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
