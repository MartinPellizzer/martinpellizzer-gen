    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. juniperoideum, commonly known as the Juniper-like clubmoss, is a variant of the common clubmoss. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili. This fern ally belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's morphology resembles that of juniper, giving it its common name. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
