    "intro": "Lobelia cliffortiana, commonly known as the cliff lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of the southeastern United States. It features vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in its native ecosystem, supporting local biodiversity."
