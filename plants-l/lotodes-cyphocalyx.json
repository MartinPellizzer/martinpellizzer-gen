It is characterized by its floating, heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in shallow water, while its leaves provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. Lotodes cyphocalyx plays an important role in water ecosystems by helping to control algae growth and improve water quality."
