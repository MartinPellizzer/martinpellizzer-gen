    "intro": "Ludwigia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved Ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Ludwigia trifoliata is also popular as an ornamental plant in aquatic gardens due to its striking foliage and ease of cultivation."
