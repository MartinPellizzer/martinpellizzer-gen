    "intro": "Lobelia luruniensis, commonly known as the Lurun lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters during the cooler months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or well-drained soils. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy, bell-shaped flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
