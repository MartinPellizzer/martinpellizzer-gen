It is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is valued for its rapid growth and is used in forage production and turfgrass mixtures. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
