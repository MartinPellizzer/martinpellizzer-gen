    "intro": "Lycium scoparium var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow boxwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its lighter-colored stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and year-round foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
