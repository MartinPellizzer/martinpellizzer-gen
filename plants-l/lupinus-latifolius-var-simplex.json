    "intro": "Lupinus latifolius var. simplex, commonly known as the broadleaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with broad, oval leaflets, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and dry slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
