    "intro": "Lomandra sonderi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage composed of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Lomandra sonderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
