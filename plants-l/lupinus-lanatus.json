    "intro": "Lupinus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its root system hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Lupinus lanatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
