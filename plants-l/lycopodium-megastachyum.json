It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium megastachyum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
