    "intro": "Lactuca polypodiifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
