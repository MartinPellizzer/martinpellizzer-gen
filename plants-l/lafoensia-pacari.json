    "intro": "Lafoensia pacari, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Pacari tree*, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, though it is less studied compared to other tropical species."
