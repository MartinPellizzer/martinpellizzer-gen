It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of pea-shaped, often blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in coastal and inland cliffs. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
