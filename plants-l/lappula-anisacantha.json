    "intro": "Lappula anisacantha, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by inflated, three-lobed seed pods. Lappula anisacantha thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
