    "intro": "Lactuca cretica, commonly known as Cretan lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in a head, similar to other lettuces. It is often found growing in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Lactuca cretica is typically harvested for its leaves, which can be used in salads or cooked like other lettuces."
