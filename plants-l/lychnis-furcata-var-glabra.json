    "intro": "Lychnis furcata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Lychnis genus."
