    "intro": "Lycopodioides deltoides, commonly known as the deltoid clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its production of spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib, and it possesses a root system that helps it anchor in soil. Lycopodioides deltoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
