    "intro": "Lathyrus stans, commonly known as the evergreen vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus stans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
