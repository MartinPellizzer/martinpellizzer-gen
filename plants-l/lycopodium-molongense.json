    "intro": "Lycopodium molongense, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium molongense thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
