    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. strictum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and a common weed in agricultural settings."
