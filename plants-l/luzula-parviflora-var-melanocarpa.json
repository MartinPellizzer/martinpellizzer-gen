The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like and often form dense clumps, while its inflorescence consists of spikes of small, greenish flowers. The variety is distinguished by its dark purple or black berries, which are a key feature in its identification."
