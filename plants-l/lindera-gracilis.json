    "intro": "Lindera gracilis, commonly known as slender spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. Its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Lindera gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland gardens."
