    "intro": "Leontopodium bonatii, commonly known as the Bonati's edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers surrounded by a ring of bracts. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of alpine resilience. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected species."
