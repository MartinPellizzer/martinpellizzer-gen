    "intro": "Libanothamnus liscanoanus, commonly known as the Liscanoan shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of central Chile. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, woody structure with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
