    "intro": "Lithospermum ireneae, commonly known as the Irene's rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of central and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
