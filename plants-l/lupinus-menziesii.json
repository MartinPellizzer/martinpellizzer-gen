It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, pinnately compound leaves that help it thrive in coastal environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast. Lupinus menziesii plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
