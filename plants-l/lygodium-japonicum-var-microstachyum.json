    "intro": "Lygodium japonicum var. microstachyum, commonly known as the Japanese climbing fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its climbing habit and fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Japan and the Philippines. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its intricate frond structure and ability to climb make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
