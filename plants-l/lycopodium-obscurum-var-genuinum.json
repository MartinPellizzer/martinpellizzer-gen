    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing strobila, which is typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant has scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure, and it produces spores in elongated, cylindrical cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Lycopodium species."
