    "intro": "Leptonychia mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense forest canopies. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in African rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains poorly understood."
