    "intro": "Lepanthes macalpinii, commonly known as the Macalpin's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. The orchid's unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
