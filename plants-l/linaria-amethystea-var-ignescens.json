    "intro": "Linaria amethystea var. ignescens, commonly known as the fiery foxglove, is a striking annual plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its vivid orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. This variety is prized in gardens for its bold, fiery blooms and heat tolerance."
