    "intro": "Lomandra filiformis subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the stiff-leaved lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, stiff, grey-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in summer, which are borne in spike-like clusters. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
