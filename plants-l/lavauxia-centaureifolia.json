    "intro": "Lavauxia centaureifolia, commonly known as the bluebells of the Canary Islands, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic islands of the Canary archipelago. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
