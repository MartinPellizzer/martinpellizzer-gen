    "intro": "Leandra grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant features long, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Leandra grandifolia is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
