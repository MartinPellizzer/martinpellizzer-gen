    "intro": "Lecaniodiscus, commonly known as the floating shield fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Lecaniodiscus species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration. The genus includes several species, with Lecaniodiscus fluitans being one of the most well-known."
