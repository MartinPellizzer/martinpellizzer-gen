    "intro": "Larix decidua subsp. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian larch, is a subspecies of the European larch native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in autumn. The tree has a slender, often twisted trunk and produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds. Its needles are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the shoots. This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the mountain ecosystems of Central and Eastern Europe."
