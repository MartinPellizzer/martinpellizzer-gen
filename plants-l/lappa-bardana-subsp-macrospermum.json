    "intro": "Lappa bardana subsp. macrospermum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and its showy, umbrella-shaped inflorescence with small white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap containing phototoxic compounds, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
