It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
