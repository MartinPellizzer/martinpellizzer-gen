    "intro": "Lindernia reptans, commonly known as the creeping lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it an effective ground cover in arid environments."
