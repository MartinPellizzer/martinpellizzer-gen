    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are palmately divided into 5-7 oval, broad leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in racemes. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
