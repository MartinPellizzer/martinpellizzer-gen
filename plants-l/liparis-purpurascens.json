    "intro": "Liparis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple and pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
