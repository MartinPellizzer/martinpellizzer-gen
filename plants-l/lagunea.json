It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dark green, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Lagunea is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
