    "intro": "Lycopodium philippense, commonly known as the Philippine clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a horizontal, underground stem called a rhizome, from which vertical shoots emerge. Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern and are often scale-like, contributing to its appearance. Lycopodium philippense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
