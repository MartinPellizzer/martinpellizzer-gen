    "intro": "Lotus dendroideus, commonly known as the tree lotus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody, tree-like structure and is often referred to as the \"desert rose\" due to its striking, pink or white blossoms. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Lotus dendroideus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical and cultural significance in traditional medicine and symbolism."
