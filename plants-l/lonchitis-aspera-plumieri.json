    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera plumieri, commonly known as the rough-stemmed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in rough, sandpapery texture, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist conditions. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
