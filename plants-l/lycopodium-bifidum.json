    "intro": "Lycopodium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium bifidum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its historical use in traditional medicine has contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
