    "intro": "Lycium morongii f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in its native habitat."
