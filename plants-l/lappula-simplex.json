    "intro": "Lappula simplex, commonly known as slender lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a dry capsule that contains several small, smooth seeds."
