    "intro": "Lobelia urens, commonly known as small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Lobeliaceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Lobelia urens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms."
