    "intro": "Leptocarpus rigoratus, commonly known as the rigid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or near the shoreline. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Leptocarpus rigoratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
