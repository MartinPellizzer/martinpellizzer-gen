    "intro": "Ligustrum robustum var. walkeri, commonly known as the Florida privet, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
