    "intro": "Leymus ruoqiangensis, commonly known as the Ruoqiang needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert steppe and dune environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Leymus ruoqiangensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of its native habitats."
