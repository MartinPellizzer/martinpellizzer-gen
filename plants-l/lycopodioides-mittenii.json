    "intro": "Lycopodioides mittenii, commonly known as the Mitten's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest, it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight."
