    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum f. gracile, commonly known as the slender marsh helleborine, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers lack the typical showy petals of many orchids, instead featuring prominent, spurred sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
