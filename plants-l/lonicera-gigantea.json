It is characterized by its long, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall. Lonicera gigantea is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
