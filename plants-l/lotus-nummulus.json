    "intro": "Lotus nummulus, commonly known as the small lotus or the nummular lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves that are round and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. The root system of Lotus nummulus is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates while supporting its buoyant foliage."
