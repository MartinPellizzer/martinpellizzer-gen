    "intro": "Lathyrus albidus, commonly known as the white vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lathyrus albidus is typically found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and sustainable agriculture."
