    "intro": "Liparis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth. Liparis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
