    "intro": "Larix gmelinii subsp. cajanderi, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a subspecies of the larch tree native to northern Asia. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves annually, typically turning golden before falling. The tree has slender, straight trunks and grows in cold climates, often in taiga or boreal forest ecosystems. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its timber and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
