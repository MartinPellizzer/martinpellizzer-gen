    "intro": "Lagarostrobos colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's pine, is a unique conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in New Zealand's native flora."
