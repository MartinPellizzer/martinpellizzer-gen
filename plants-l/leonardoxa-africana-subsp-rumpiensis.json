    "intro": "Leonardoxa africana subsp. rumpiensis, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces long, cylindrical pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and mountainous areas. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a valuable species for reforestation and agroforestry projects."
