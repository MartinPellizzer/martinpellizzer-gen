    "intro": "Lemna trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant has three distinct veins running from the base to the tip of each leaf, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Lemna trinervis reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
