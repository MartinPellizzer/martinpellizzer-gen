    "intro": "Lantana subtracta, commonly known as the lesser lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lantana subtracta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems and a compact form."
