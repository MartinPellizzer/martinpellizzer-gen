    "intro": "Lepicaune balsamea, commonly known as the northern balsam, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white. Its scientific name reflects its association with the balsam genus, though it is not closely related to the more well-known wintergreen. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
