    "intro": "Lycopodium crebre, commonly known as the ground pine, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that resemble pine needles. It is a vascular plant that reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in forests or rocky areas. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for small organisms."
