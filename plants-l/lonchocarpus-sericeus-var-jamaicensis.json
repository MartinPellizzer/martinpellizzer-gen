    "intro": "Lonchocarpus sericeus var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican velvet bean, is a tropical leguminous plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds covered in a silky, fibrous coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
