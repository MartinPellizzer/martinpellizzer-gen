    "intro": "Lycium berlandieri var. longistylum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration."
