    "intro": "Lotea, commonly known as the common lote, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing several round seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lotea thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found growing along riverbanks and in disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment."
