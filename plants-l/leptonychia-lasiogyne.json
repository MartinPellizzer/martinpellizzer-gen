    "intro": "Leptonychia lasiogyne, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often scale-like and reduced, adapting to its aquatic lifestyle. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow in color, and are pollinated by insects."
