    "intro": "Loranthus tienyensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host tree. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified to form a spongy, velvety structure. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together, followed by red berries that contain sticky seeds. It is native to China and is often found in forested areas where it thrives on a variety of host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems."
