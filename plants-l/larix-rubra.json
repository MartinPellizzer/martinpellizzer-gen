    "intro": "Larix rubra, commonly known as the red larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking reddish-brown bark and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves turn a vivid yellow before falling in autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty. The red larch is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in forest ecosystems."
