    "intro": "Lepisorus mussooriensis, commonly known as the Kashmir stone fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Lepisorus mussooriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
