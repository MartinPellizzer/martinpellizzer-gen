    "intro": "Linum verruciferum, commonly known as the rough flax or woolly flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to the flax plant used for fiber production. Linum verruciferum is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained conditions."
