    "intro": "Lathyrus cirrhosus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
