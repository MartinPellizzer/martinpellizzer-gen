It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant typically forms mats on the forest floor, with slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms. Its reproductive structures are prominent, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
