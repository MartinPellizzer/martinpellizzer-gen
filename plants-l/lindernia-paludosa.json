    "intro": "Lindernia paludosa, commonly known as marsh lindernia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. Lindernia paludosa is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils through its extensive root system."
