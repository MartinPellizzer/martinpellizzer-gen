    "intro": "Lissochilus kapandensis, commonly known as the Kapanda orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. This orchid is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters."
