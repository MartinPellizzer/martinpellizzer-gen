    "intro": "Limonium maritimum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature. Limonium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
