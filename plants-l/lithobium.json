    "intro": "Lithobium, commonly known as the stone lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found growing on rocks, tree bark, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of both the fungal and algal components. Lithobium is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its presence often indicates a stable, undisturbed ecological environment."
