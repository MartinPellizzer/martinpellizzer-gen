    "intro": "Lechea depressa, commonly known as the flat lechea, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Lechea depressa is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
