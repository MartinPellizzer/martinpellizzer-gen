    "intro": "Lepanthes biloba, commonly known as the biloba orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often dry or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Lepanthes biloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
