    "intro": "Lobelia imperialis, commonly known as the imperial lobelia, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it one of the tallest species in the Lobelia genus. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue and purple, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lobelia imperialis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
