    "intro": "Lupinus geraniophilus, commonly known as the California lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stem and pinnately compound leaves with a silvery-blue appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Lupinus geraniophilus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
