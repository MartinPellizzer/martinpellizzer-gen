    "intro": "Lecanocarpus cauliflorus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a distinctive cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and cones develop directly from the trunk or branches. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its compact appearance. Lecanocarpus cauliflorus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
