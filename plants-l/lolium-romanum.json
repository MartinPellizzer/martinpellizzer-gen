    "intro": "Lolium romanum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. Italian ryegrass is known for its rapid growth and high nutritional value, making it a popular choice for forage and turfgrass. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agricultural and horticultural settings."
