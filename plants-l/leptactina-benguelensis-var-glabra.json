    "intro": "Leptactina benguelensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved leptactina, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
