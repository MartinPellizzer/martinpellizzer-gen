    "intro": "Leucohyle dasyandra, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
