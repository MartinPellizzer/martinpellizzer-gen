    "intro": "Lobivia kuehnrichii var. antennifera, commonly known as the Antennae Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features short, cylindrical stems with a distinctive blue-gray coloration and sparse, woolly covering. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a dense, branching structure with short, hooked spines that give it its common name. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
