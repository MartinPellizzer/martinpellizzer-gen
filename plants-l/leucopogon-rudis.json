    "intro": "Leucopogon rudis, commonly known as the rough leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the heath family, Ericaceae, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Leucopogon rudis is often found in rocky or sandy areas, where it thrives in full sun."
