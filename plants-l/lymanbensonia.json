    "intro": "Lymanbensonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is known for its limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Botanists study Lymanbensonia to better understand its ecological needs and conservation status."
