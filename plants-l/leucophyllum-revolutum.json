    "intro": "Leucophyllum revolutum, commonly known as Texas betony, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
