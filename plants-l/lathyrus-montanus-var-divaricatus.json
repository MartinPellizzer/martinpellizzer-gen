    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus var. divaricatus, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy slopes and rocky habitats."
