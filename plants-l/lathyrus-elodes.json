    "intro": "Lathyrus elodes, commonly known as the water pea, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing small, round seeds. Lathyrus elodes thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
