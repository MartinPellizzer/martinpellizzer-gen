    "intro": "Lepisanthes hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive color pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to thrive in the humid and shaded conditions of the forest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
