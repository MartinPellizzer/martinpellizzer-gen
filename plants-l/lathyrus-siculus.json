    "intro": "Lathyrus siculus, commonly known as Sicilian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by cylindrical pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
