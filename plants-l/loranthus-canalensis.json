    "intro": "Loranthus canalensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red laurier, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as mangroves and other tropical hardwoods. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish or reddish flowers that are often visited by insects and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can be dispersed by wind or animals. Loranthus canalensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth and health of its host trees."
