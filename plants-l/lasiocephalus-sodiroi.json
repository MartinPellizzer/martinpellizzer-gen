    "intro": "Lasiocephalus sodiroi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand the cold and strong winds of its habitat. Lasiocephalus sodiroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
