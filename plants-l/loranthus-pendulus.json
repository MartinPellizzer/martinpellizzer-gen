    "intro": "Loranthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. Loranthus pendulus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments."
