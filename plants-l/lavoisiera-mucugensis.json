It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in moist soil near water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are often bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
