    "intro": "Leichhardtia argillicola, commonly known as the clay soil lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or clay soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
