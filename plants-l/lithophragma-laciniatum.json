    "intro": "Lithophragma laciniatum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Lithophragma laciniatum is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-elevation plant communities."
