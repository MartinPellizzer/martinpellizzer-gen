The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base, while the stems are often woody and branched. Laxmannia arborea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
