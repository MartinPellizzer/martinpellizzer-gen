    "intro": "Lepanthes exposita, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are designed for pollination by specific insects, and it has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lepanthes exposita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
