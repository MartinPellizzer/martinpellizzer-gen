It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming compact clumps with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad, grass-like, and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its elegance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in both indoor and greenhouse settings."
