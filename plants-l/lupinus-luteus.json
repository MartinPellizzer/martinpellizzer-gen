    "intro": "Lupinus luteus, commonly known as yellow lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Yellow lupine is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and grasslands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
