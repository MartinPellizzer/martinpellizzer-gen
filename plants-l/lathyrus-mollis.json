    "intro": "Lathyrus mollis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnate, composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lathyrus mollis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to floral diversity."
