    "intro": "Lazarum weipanum, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its bright blooms. Lazarum weipanum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a critically endangered species."
