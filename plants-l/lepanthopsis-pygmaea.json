    "intro": "Lepanthopsis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is characterized by its compact size and unique floral structure, which includes a spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
