    "intro": "Litsea aurea, commonly known as golden flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, orange-red fruits. Litsea aurea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant foliage and showy floral display."
