    "intro": "Leptopoda helenioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf helenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
