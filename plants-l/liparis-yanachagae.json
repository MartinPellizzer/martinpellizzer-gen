    "intro": "Liparis yanachagae, commonly known as the Yanachaga orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis yanachagae is considered a rare and endangered species."
