    "intro": "Lysimachia tomentosa, commonly known as wooly yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Lysimachia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
