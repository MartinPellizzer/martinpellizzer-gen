It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a rosette-like structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Lepisorus krameri thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth."
