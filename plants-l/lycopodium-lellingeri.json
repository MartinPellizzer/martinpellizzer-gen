It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium lellingeri is a primitive vascular plant, showcasing features similar to those of ancient plant species."
