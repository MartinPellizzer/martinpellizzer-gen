    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. nigricans, commonly known as black tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that are often dark green to black in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its small, triangular leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in early to mid-summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
