    "intro": "Lotodes parvum, commonly known as the small water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems spread across the water's surface. Lotodes parvum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
