It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for its purported healing properties. The silver fern is also a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage and national identity."
