    "intro": "Lyonia lucida f. rubra, commonly known as the redflower lyonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in native plant gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
