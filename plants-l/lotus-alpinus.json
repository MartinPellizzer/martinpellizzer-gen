    "intro": "Lotus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine lotus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lotus alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
