It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle gradient. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Lockhartia pallida is prized in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
