It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodiella sarcocaulos is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems, particularly in regions with limestone substrates."
