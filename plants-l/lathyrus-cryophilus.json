    "intro": "Lathyrus cryophilus, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus cryophilus thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where temperatures are cool. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
