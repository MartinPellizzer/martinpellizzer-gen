    "intro": "Lyrocarpa coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's lyreleaf, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique lyre-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
