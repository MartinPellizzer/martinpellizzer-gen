    "intro": "Leptospermum roseum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Leptospermum roseum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
