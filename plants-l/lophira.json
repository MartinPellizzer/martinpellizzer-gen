    "intro": "Lophira, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often pinnate or bipinnate, and their small, fragrant flowers that typically have five petals. Lophira species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Additionally, some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and unique floral structures."
