    "intro": "Limnophila fragrans, commonly known as sweetflag, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Pontederiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, often contributing to the structure of aquatic ecosystems. Limnophila fragrans is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
