    "intro": "Lotus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, toothed edge on its petals. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
