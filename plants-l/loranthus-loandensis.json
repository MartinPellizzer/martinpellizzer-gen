    "intro": "Loranthus loandensis, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. Loranthus loandensis is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
