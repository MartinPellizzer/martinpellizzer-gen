    "intro": "Lupinus geophilus, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus geophilus is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy species suitable for native plant gardens."
