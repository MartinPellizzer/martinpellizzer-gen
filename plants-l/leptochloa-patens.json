It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its delicate, flat panicles and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
