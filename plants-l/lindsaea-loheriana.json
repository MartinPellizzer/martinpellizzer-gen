    "intro": "Lindsaea loheriana, commonly known as the loher's maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to trees and absorb moisture. Lindsaea loheriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
