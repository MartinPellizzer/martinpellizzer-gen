    "intro": "Litobrochia montbrisonis, commonly known as the Montbrison stone lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Pertusariaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to rock surfaces. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude habitats. It is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates in mountainous regions of Europe. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological monitoring."
