    "intro": "Limonium semenowii var. chrysocephalum, commonly known as the golden-headed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow or golden floral heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread along coastal areas. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate saline and coastal conditions."
