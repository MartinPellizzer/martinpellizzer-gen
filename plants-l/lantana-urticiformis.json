    "intro": "Lantana urticiformis, commonly known as the rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
