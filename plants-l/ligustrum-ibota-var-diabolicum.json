    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota var. diabolicum, commonly known as the devil's ligustrum, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural areas."
