    "intro": "Larnastyra verbenaca, commonly known as the common verbena. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing vibrant purple or blue hues that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Larnastyra verbenaca is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
