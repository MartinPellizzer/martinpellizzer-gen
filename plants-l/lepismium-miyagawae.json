    "intro": "Lepismium miyagawae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
