    "intro": "Lachemilla moritziana, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Lachemilla moritziana is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy and ornamental choice for alpine gardens."
