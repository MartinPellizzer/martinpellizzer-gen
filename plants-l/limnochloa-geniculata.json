    "intro": "Limnochloa geniculata, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, thriving in muddy or waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Limnochloa geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
