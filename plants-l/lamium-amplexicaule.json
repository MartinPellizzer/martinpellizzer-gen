    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule, commonly known as greater calamint, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name \"amplexicaule,\" which means \"embrace the stem.\" The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium amplexicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
