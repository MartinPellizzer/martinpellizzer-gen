    "intro": "Leptopharynx grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered leptopharynx, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
