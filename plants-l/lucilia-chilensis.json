    "intro": "Lucilia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean flesh fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Lucilia chilensis plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for various insectivorous animals."
