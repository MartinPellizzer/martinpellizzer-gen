    "intro": "Leptandra borissovae, commonly known as the Borissov's leptandra, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
