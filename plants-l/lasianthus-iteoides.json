It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
