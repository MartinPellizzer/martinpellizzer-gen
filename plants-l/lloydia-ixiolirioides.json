    "intro": "Lloydia ixiolirioides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Georgia and Florida, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small ghosts, hence its common name. It has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Lloydia ixiolirioides is a short-lived perennial that blooms in late spring and early summer, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
