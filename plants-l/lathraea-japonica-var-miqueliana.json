    "intro": "Lathraea japonica var. miqueliana, commonly known as the Japanese ghost flower, is a rare and unique parasitic plant native to parts of East Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, often grasses or shrubs. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
