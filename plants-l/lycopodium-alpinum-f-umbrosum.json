    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a fern species characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that thrive in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to mountainous regions of Europe. The plant features small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, a typical trait of lycophytes. Its unique coloration helps it absorb more light in low-light conditions, making it well-adapted to its habitat. This fern is often found in rocky soils and is a distinctive addition to woodland and alpine ecosystems."
