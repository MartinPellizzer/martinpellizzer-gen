    "intro": "Lupinus nepubescens, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spindly stems with clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Its root system forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Lupinus nepubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
