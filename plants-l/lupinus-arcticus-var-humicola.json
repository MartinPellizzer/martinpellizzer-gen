    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus var. humicola, commonly known as the Arctic lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Lupinus arcticus var. humicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for herbivores in its native range."
