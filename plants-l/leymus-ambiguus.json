    "intro": "Leymus ambiguus, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Leymus ambiguus is adapted to thrive in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
