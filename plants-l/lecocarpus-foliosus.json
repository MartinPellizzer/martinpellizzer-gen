    "intro": "Lecocarpus foliosus, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are divided into broad, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
