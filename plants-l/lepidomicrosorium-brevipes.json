    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize aquatic habitats. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
