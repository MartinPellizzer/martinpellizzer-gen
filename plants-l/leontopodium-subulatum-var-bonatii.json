    "intro": "Leontopodium subulatum var. bonatii, commonly known as the Bonati's edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil and harsh climatic conditions. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and over-collection."
