    "intro": "Lycium tenuispinosum var. calycinum, commonly known as the narrow-spined boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, spiny leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in landscaping and as a hedging plant."
