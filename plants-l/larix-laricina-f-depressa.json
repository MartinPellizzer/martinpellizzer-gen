    "intro": "Larix laricina f. depressa, commonly known as the creeping larch, is a low-growing variant of the tamarack tree. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in wet, boggy environments. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically green in summer and turn golden in autumn. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh northern climates and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
