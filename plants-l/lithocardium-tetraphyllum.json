    "intro": "Lithocardium tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
