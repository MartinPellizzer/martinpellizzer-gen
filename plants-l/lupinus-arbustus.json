    "intro": "Lupinus arbustus, commonly known as the bush lupin, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of pea-like flowers, usually in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules. Lupinus arbustus is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils."
