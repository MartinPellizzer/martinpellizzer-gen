    "intro": "Lepechinia graveolens, commonly known as the skunk vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Lepechinia graveolens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
