    "intro": "Linaria praecox, commonly known as early toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves are characteristic of its morphology. Linaria praecox is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in marginal conditions."
