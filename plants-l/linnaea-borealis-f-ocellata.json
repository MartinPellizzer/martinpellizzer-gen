    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. ocellata, commonly known as the star flower or the white star, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower. This plant is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in boreal and temperate forests. The foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
