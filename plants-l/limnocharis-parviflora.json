    "intro": "Limnocharis parviflora, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like leaves that float on the surface of water, with each leaf having a spongy, waxy texture that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems."
