    "intro": "Linaria atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and narrow, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Linaria atlantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
