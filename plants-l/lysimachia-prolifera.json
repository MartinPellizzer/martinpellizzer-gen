    "intro": "Lysimachia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively across moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lysimachia prolifera is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wet areas."
