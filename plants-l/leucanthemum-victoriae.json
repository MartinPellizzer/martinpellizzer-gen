    "intro": "Leucanthemum victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's Leucanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of white ray florets surrounding a yellow disk floret. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
