    "intro": "Lecanolepis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. These organisms are composite organisms consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Lecanolepis species are often found growing on rocks, soil, or bark in various habitats, including arid and temperate regions. They are characterized by their crust-like growth form and distinct chemical compositions, which contribute to their ecological roles in nutrient cycling. Due to their slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are valuable indicators of air quality and ecosystem health."
