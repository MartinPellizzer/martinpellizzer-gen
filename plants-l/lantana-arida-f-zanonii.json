    "intro": "Lantana arida f. zanonii, commonly known as the desert lantana, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Lantana arida f. zanonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
