    "intro": "Lepanthes via-incarum, commonly known as the silver star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that have a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
