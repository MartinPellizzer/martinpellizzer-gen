    "intro": "Lysimachia esquirolii, commonly known as the Alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Lysimachia esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in high-altitude environments."
