    "intro": "Lycopsis hispida, commonly known as the rough lycopsis, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Lycopsis hispida is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
