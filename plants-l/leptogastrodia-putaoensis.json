    "intro": "Leptogastrodia putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao sand orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip petal. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
