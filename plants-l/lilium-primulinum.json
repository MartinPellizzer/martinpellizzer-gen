It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. The flowers are tubular at the base and expand into a cup-like shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
