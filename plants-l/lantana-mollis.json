    "intro": "Lantana mollis, commonly known as silver lantana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and orange, depending on the variety. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun. Lantana mollis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
