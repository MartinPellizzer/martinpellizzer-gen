    "intro": "Leptodactylon lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically adorned with a pale lilac or pinkish coloration along the veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Leptodactylon lilacinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
