    "intro": "Luisia alpina, commonly known as the alpine luisia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees. This evergreen shrub typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces dark blue or black berries. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a compact growth form and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss."
