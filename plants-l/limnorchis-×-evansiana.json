    "intro": "Limnorchis \u00d7 evansiana, commonly known as the hybrid water shield, is a wetland plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Limnorchis peltata and Limnorchis minor, both native to North America. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water. Limnorchis \u00d7 evansiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
