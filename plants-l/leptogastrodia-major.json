    "intro": "Leptogastrodia major, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wet tropical forests of northern Australia. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble stars, with vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive red and yellow throat. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. The plant's morphology includes long, strap-like leaves and a robust root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leptogastrodia major is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
