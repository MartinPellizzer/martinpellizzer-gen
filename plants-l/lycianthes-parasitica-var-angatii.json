    "intro": "Lycianthes parasitica var. angatii, commonly known as the Angatii morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. Its unique parasitic behavior and ornamental flowers make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
