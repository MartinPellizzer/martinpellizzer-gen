It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important species in ecological restoration projects."
