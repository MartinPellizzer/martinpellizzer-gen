    "intro": "Lecythopsis, commonly known as the \"cork plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Lecythopsis species are characterized by their distinctive, thick, cork-like leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in whorled arrangements, and come in shades of white, pink, and purple."
