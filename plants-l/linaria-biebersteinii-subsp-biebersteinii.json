    "intro": "Linaria biebersteinii subsp. biebersteinii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
