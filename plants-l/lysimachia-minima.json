    "intro": "Lysimachia minima, commonly known as lesser yellow archangel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces, and its stems are often prostrate or semi-upright. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lysimachia minima is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread through rhizomes."
