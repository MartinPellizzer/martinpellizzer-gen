    "intro": "Leontodon dentatus, commonly known as the toothed hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often have toothed margins, contributing to its common name. The flowers bloom in summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets."
