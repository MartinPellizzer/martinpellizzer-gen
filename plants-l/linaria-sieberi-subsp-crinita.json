    "intro": "Linaria sieberi subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
