    "intro": "Limnorchis saccata, commonly known as the sac-like liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode that primarily infects the liver of various mammals, including humans. It belongs to the family Fasciolidae and is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like body shape. The adult fluke attaches to the bile ducts using a muscular oral sucker and a ventral sucker. Its life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and freshwater crustaceans, before reaching the definitive host. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a parasitic flatworm."
