    "intro": "Leptocarpus barbatus, commonly known as the featherleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal exposure. Leptocarpus barbatus is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
