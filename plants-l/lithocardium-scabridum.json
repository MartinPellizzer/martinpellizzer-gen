It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it stores water in its thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Lithocardium scabridum is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
