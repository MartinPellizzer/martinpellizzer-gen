It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces large, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of white, pink, or red, which appear in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
