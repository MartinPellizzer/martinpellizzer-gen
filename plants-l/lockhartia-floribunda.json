    "intro": "Lockhartia floribunda, commonly known as the orchid mantilla, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive white lip, which are highly fragrant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Lockhartia floribunda is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
