    "intro": "Lupinaster litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii lupinaster, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, often in shades of pink or purple. Lupinaster litwinowii is adapted to harsh, arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
