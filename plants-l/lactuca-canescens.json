It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family.
