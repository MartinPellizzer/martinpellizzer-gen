    "intro": "Lolium linicola, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Lolium linicola is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in agricultural settings."
