    "intro": "Lathyrus gerardii, commonly known as wild vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Lathyrus gerardii plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
