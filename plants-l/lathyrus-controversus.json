    "intro": "Lathyrus controversus, commonly known as the controversial pea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. However, due to the presence of neurotoxic alkaloids, it is considered potentially harmful to humans and animals."
