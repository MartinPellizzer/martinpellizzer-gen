    "intro": "Loranthus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a distinctive spotted pattern, contributing to its common name. Loranthus maculatus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for native wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees."
