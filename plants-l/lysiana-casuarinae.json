    "intro": "Lysiana casuarinae, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its feathery foliage and distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in groups of three. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Lysiana casuarinae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal species."
