It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tint, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a dense, spiny coat that helps protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
