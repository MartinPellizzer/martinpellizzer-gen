    "intro": "Lithospermum rivulare, commonly known as red sandalwood or river lithospermum, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is notable for containing compounds such as lithospermic acid, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Lithospermum rivulare thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near streams or in open woodlands."
