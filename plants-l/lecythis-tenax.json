    "intro": "Lecythis tenax, commonly known as the rubber tree or Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree is notable for its latex-producing properties, which have historically been tapped for natural rubber. Its fruits are large, woody capsules that split open to reveal bright red, edible seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and has been widely cultivated for commercial rubber production."
