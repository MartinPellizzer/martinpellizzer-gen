    "intro": "Lavandula minor, commonly known as narrowleaf lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant lavender-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and often used in perfumery and herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and medicinal cultivation. Lavandula minor is closely related to other lavender species but is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
