    "intro": "Lepionurus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lepionurus, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in spikes, which bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Lepionurus oblongifolius is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
