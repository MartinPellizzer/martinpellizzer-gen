    "intro": "Lygodium palmatilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its fronds are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help retain moisture. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
