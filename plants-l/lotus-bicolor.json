    "intro": "Lotus bicolor, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Asia. It features showy, pink-and-white flowers that bloom on long, slender stems above water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, while its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, woody pod. The lotus is known for its ability to thrive in muddy waters and is often associated with purity and spiritual symbolism in various cultures."
