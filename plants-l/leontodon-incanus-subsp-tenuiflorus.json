    "intro": "Leontodon incanus subsp. tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slenderflower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with ray florets and tubular disc florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender floral stems and reduced flower size compared to other members of the species."
