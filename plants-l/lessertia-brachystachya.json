    "intro": "Lessertia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
