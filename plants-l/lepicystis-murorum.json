    "intro": "Lepicystis murorum, commonly known as the mouse ear cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in urban areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
