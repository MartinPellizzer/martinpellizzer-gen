    "intro": "Leandra pratensis, commonly known as the marsh hollyhock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Leandra pratensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
