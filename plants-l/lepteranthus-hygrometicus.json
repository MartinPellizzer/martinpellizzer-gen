    "intro": "Lepteranthus hygrometicus, commonly known as the moisture-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific humid environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment, and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
