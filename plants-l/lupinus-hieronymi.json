    "intro": "Lupinus hieronymi, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pea-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus hieronymi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
