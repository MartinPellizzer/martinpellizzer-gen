It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, with two lips, characteristic of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
