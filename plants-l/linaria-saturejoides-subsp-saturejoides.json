It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with yellow-orange petals and a distinctive bilabiate structure, typical of the Plantaginaceae family.
