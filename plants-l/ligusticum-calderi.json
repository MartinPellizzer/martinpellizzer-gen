    "intro": "Ligusticum calderi, commonly known as the Calder's lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, appearing in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Ligusticum calderi is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its medicinal and culinary properties in traditional herbal practices."
