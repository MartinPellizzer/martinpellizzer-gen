    "intro": "Lagenophora pumila, commonly known as the small bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
