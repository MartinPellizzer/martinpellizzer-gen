    "intro": "Lutzia fruticosa f. litorea, commonly known as the coastal lutzia, is a shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline conditions and strong coastal winds. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along the coastline."
