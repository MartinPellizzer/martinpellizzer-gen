    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
