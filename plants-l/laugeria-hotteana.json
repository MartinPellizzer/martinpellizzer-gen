It features a cylindrical stem with a star-shaped pattern of raised tubercles, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
