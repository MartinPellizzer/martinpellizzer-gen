    "intro": "Lafoensia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf lafoensia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in small garden spaces or as a container plant. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
