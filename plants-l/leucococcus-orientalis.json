    "intro": "Leucococcus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental white cocoon vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
