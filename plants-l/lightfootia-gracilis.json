    "intro": "Lightfootia gracilis, commonly known as the slender lightfootia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Lightfootia gracilis is typically found in shallow water or damp soil, making it a characteristic species of marshy environments."
