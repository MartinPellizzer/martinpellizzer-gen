    "intro": "Lagenocarpus martii f. typicus, commonly known as the typical form of the genus Lagenocarpus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fruits that resemble small, elongated capsules, which are typically green when mature and turn brown upon drying. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its fibrous, woody structure. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specialized habitats and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
