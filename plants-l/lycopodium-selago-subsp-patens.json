    "intro": "Lycopodium selago subsp. patens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen clubmoss that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically clustered in small groups. It is native to various regions in Europe and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize harsh habitats, it plays a significant role in stabilizing rocky substrates and supporting local biodiversity."
