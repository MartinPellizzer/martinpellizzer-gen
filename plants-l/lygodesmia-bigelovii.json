    "intro": "Lygodesmia bigelovii, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
