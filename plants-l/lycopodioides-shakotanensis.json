    "intro": "Lycopodioides shakotanensis, commonly known as the Shakotan clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the remote Shakotan Island in Japan. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution. This species plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its unique island ecosystem."
