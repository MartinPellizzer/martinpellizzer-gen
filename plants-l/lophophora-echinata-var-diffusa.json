    "intro": "Lophophora echinata var. diffusa, commonly known as the Diffuse Peyote, is a cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a short, thick stem that produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, making it significant in both traditional and modern contexts. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is protected in many regions and is often cultivated in controlled settings."
