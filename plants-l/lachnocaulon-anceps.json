It has a distinctive appearance with a pale green to yellowish thallus and a dense, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Lachnocaulon anceps plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
