It features narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in suitable climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
