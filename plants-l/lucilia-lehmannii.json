    "intro": "Lucilia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive, elongated abdomen. The plant is not a botanical species but rather an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. It is often found in association with decaying organic matter, where it plays a role in decomposition. This species is widely distributed across various regions, including parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa."
