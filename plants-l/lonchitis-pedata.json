    "intro": "Lonchitis pedata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Lonchitis pedata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
