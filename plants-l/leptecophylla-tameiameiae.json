    "intro": "Leptecophylla tameiameiae, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold, windy environments of Antarctica. It is one of the few flowering plants that survive in the extreme conditions of the continent, growing in rocky soil and on bare ground. The plant has very small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common strategy in its harsh habitat. This species plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the fragile Antarctic ecosystem."
