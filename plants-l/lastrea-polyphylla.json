    "intro": "Lastrea polyphylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Lastrea polyphylla is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
