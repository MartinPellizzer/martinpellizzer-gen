    "intro": "Leucothoe tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly Korea and China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are typically elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy texture. Leucothoe tschonoskii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
