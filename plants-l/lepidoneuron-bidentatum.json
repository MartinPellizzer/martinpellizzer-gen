    "intro": "Lepidoneuron bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a unique arrangement of pinnae and small, tooth-like projections. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in moist environments. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
