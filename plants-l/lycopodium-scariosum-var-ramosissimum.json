    "intro": "Lycopodium scariosum var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the branched clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its branching stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems."
