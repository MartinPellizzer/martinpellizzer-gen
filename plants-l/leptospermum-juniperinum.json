    "intro": "Leptospermum juniperinum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a popular plant for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
