    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum f. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in pairs and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
