    "intro": "Luzula campestris proles insularis, commonly known as the island tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to certain island regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
