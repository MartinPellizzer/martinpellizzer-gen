    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's lespeadeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woods, grasslands, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza thunbergii is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality."
