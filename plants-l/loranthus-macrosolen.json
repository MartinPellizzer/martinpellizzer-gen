    "intro": "Loranthus macrosolen, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Loranthus macrosolen is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
