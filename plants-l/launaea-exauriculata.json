    "intro": "Launaea exauriculata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and basal rosettes of fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Launaea exauriculata is adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
