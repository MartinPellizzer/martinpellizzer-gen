    "intro": "Lindmania albicans, commonly known as the white-veined sword fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that have a distinctive white-veined appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Lindmania albicans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
