    "intro": "Lithops triebneri, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant's leaves are typically green or reddish with distinct markings that aid in camouflage. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Lithops triebneri is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
