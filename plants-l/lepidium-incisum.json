    "intro": "Lepidium incisum, commonly known as the cut-leaved peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often notched or cut. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, smooth pods and are dispersed by wind. Lepidium incisum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
