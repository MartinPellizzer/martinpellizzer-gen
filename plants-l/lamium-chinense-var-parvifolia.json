It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201330 centimeters and thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it spreads through rhizomes. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
