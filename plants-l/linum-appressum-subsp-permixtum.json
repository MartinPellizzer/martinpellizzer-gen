    "intro": "Linum appressum subsp. permixtum, commonly known as the mixed flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along woodland edges. This subspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and is sometimes used in botanical studies for its adaptive traits."
