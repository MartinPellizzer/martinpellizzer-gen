    "intro": "Lonicera himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It features opposite, elongated leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant's berries, which are red or yellow, are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals."
