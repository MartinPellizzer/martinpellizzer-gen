    "intro": "Lunathyrium viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronted moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its botanical classification places it within the family Campanulaceae, which includes many bell-shaped flowers. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
