    "intro": "Lupinus canus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus canus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
