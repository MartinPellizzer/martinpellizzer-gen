    "intro": "Lupinus bracteolaris var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets that are often hairy. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
