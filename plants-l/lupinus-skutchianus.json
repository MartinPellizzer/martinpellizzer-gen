    "intro": "Lupinus skutchianus, commonly known as Skutch's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Skutch's lupine is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
