It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and branched stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
