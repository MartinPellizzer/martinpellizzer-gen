It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and colorful fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
