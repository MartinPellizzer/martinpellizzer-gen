    "intro": "Loranthus luteus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Loranthus luteus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
