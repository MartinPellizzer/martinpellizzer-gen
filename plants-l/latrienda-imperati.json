    "intro": "Latrienda imperati, commonly known as the imperial latrienda, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, erect stem that bears clusters of blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
