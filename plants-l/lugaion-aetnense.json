    "intro": "Lugaion aetnense, commonly known as the Aeolian lichen, is a rare and endemic lichen species found exclusively on the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and closely adherent to the substrate. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner allows it to thrive in the harsh, mineral-rich environments of the volcano. Its presence is an indicator of the ecological conditions specific to the volcanic soils of the region. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable species for studying ecological adaptation and conservation in volcanic ecosystems."
