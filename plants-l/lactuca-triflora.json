    "intro": "Lactuca triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Lactuca triflora is sometimes cultivated as a wild edible, though it is not commonly consumed due to its bitter taste."
