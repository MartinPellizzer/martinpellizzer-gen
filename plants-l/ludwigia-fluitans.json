    "intro": "Ludwigia fluitans, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that emerge above the water. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Ludwigia fluitans is sometimes used in ornamental water gardens but can become invasive in non-native habitats."
