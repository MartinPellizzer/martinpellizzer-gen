    "intro": "Lecanopteris celebica, commonly known as the Celebes shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly found in the Moluccas and surrounding islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the presence of high humidity and well-drained soil. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Lecanopteris celebica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
