    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pea vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Its seeds are encased in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
