    "intro": "Lindera puberula, commonly known as roughleaf ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially sunny areas. Lindera puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native wildlife."
