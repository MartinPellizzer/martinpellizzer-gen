    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis subsp. perennis, commonly known as the creeping hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated flower head with ray florets and a central disc of tubular flowers. The subspecies perennis is distinguished by its more robust growth habit and longer flowering stems compared to other subspecies."
