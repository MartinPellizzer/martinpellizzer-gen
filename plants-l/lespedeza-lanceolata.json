    "intro": "Lespedeza lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can help prevent soil erosion. Lespedeza lanceolata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
