    "intro": "Lophiolepis adjarica, commonly known as the Adjara lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to brownish in color, and it often exhibits a granular texture. It is primarily found in temperate and subtropical regions, particularly on calcareous substrates. This lichen is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
