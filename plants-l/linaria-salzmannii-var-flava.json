    "intro": "Linaria salzmannii var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
