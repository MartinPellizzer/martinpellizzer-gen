It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, globe-shaped bulbs that store nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and early blooming habit."
