    "intro": "Lathyrus ochropetalus subsp. holochlorus, commonly known as the yellow pea vine, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
