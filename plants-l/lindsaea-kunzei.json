It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-hued fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Lindsaea kunzei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
