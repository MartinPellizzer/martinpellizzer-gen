    "intro": "Lotus pilosissimus var. filiformis, commonly known as the silky lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and delicate, floating leaves that create a lush, green canopy on the water's surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments. This variety is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
