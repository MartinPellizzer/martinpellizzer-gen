    "intro": "Lotus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
