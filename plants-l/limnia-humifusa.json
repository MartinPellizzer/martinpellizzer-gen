    "intro": "Limnia humifusa, commonly known as the marsh willow or swamp willow, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found along stream banks, marshes, and pond edges. The plant has slender, willow-like stems that are often prostrate or creeping, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are inconspicuous and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in pollination by insects. Limnia humifusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
