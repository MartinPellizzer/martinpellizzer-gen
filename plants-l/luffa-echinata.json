    "intro": "Luffa echinata, commonly known as the spiny luffa, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, fibrous fruits that mature to a woody texture. The outer skin of the fruit is typically rough and covered with small spines, while the inner part develops into a spongy, fibrous material. This fibrous material is commonly used for sponges and scrubbing pads, making it a useful and versatile plant in both culinary and domestic applications."
