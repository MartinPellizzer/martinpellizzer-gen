    "intro": "Lobelia nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf lobelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
