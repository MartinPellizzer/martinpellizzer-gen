The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
