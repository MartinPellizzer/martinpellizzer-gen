    "intro": "Loranthus subalatus, commonly known as the alpine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light that penetrates its host's canopy. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is typically found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas."
