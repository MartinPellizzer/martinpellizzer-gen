It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, yellowish flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
