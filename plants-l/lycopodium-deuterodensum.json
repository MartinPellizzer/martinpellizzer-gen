    "intro": "Lycopodium deuterodensum, commonly known as the dense frond lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium deuterodensum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
