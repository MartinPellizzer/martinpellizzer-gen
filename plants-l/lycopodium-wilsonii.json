It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features whorled leaves that form dense clusters, and it produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores. Lycopodium wilsonii is characterized by its primitive structure, with upright stems and specialized reproductive organs. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various organisms."
