    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf privet, is a variant of the common privet characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and resemble those of boxwood, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate pruning. This variety is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world."
