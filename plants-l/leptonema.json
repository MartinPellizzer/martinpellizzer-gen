    "intro": "Leptonema, commonly known as the small leaf fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its compact, often clustered growth habit and its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically features a short rhizome with dense, fibrous roots, which help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in spadices, a common feature among members of the Araceae family. Leptonema species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they contribute to the biodiversity of forest understories."
