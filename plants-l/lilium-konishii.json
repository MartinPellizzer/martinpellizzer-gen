    "intro": "Lilium konishii, commonly known as the Konishii lily, is a rare and striking species native to Japan. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pinkish-white petals with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
