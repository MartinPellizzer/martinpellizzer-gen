It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its fibrous root system is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This species is often found in open woodlands and meadows, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
