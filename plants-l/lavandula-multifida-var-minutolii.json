It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soothing fragrance and ability to attract pollinators."
