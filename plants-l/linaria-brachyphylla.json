    "intro": "Linaria brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the genus Linaria in the family Plantaginaceae, characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Linaria brachyphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
