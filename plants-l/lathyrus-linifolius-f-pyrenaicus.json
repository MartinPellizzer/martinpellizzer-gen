    "intro": "Lathyrus linifolius f. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
