It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming during the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil. It is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
