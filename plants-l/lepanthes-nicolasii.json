    "intro": "Lepanthes nicolasii, commonly known as the Nicolas's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green to white with intricate patterns, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes nicolasii is considered a conservation concern."
