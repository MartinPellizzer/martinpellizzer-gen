    "intro": "Lepanthes vareschii, commonly known as the Var\u00e8sch's slipper orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, ovate leaves that are usually clustered at the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
