    "intro": "Lathyrus laxiflorus var. rotundatus, commonly known as the round-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, rounded, violet-blue flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with oval leaflets that are hairy and slightly pointed. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
