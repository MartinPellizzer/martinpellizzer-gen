    "intro": "Limeum viscosum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the sticky lime tree, is a variant of the sticky lime plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and contributes to its unique botanical properties. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing fragrant, yellowish blooms that attract pollinators. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe, which is edible but has a mildly acidic and sometimes bitter taste."
