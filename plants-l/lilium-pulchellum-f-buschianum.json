    "intro": "Lilium pulchellum f. buschianum, commonly known as the Buschianum lily, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the Turk's cap lily. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals with a distinctive yellow throat, which sets it apart from other lily species. This perennial plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
