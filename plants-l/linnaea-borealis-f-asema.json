It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic regions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces red berries that contain seeds. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Linnaea borealis."
