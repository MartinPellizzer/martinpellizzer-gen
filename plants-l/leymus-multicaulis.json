    "intro": "Leymus multicaulis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and moderate drought conditions. Leymus multicaulis plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
