    "intro": "Lysimachia deltoidea var. cinerascens, commonly known as silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its delicate, low-growing habit and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The varietal form, cinerascens, is distinguished by its more pronounced silvering of the foliage compared to the typical variety."
