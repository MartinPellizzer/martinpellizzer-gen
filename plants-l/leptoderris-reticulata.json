    "intro": "Leptoderris reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
