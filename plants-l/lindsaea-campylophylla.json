    "intro": "Lindsaea campylophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many diverse and often strikingly beautiful plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, arching leaves that form a rosette, often with a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Lindsaea campylophylla is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
