    "intro": "Lotus palaestinus, commonly known as the Palestine water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its flowers are showy, with pink or white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Lotus palaestinus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
