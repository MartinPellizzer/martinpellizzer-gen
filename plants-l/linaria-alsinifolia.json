    "intro": "Linaria alsinifolia, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of snapdragons, with two lips that are characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves contribute to its delicate appearance. Linaria alsinifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
