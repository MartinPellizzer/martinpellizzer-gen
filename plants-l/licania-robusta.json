    "intro": "Licania robusta, commonly known as the robust licania, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland forest environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Licania robusta is often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability to varying soil conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various insects and birds in its native ecosystem."
