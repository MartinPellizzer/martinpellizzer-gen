    "intro": "Lycium pallidum subsp. exsertum, commonly known as the pale boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
