    "intro": "Lugoa revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Lugoa revoluta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
