    "intro": "Lupinus tarapacensis, commonly known as the Tarapac\u00e1 lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, saline soils, making it a hardy species in extreme environments. Its leaves are typically compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus tarapacensis plays an important role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
