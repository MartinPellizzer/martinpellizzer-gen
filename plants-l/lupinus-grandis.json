    "intro": "Lupinus grandis, commonly known as the large lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of violet or blue-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus grandis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
