    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subochracea, commonly known as the yellow twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Europe. The plant features small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapting to cold climates. This form is distinguished by its more intensely yellow floral coloration compared to the typical white or pink flowers of the species."
