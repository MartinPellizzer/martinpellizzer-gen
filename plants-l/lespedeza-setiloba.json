    "intro": "Lespedeza setiloba, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
