    "intro": "Lepidium capitatum var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits called siliques, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Native to East Asia, it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is edible and has been used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine."
