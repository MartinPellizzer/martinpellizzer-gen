    "intro": "Lilium lishmannii, commonly known as the Lishmann's lily, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium lishmannii is considered a species of conservation concern."
