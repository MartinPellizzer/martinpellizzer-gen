    "intro": "Limonium britannicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flower heads and gray-green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium britannicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
