    "intro": "Listrostachys iridifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring silver-gray foliage and clusters of tiny, blue-violet flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's ornamental value lies in its striking color contrast and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
