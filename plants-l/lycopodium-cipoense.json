    "intro": "Lycopodium cipoense, commonly known as the Cipo clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features whorled leaves that are needle-like and often form dense clusters at the base. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium cipoense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
