The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and resilience in coastal environments."
