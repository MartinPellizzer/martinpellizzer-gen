    "intro": "Lemna perpusilla, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the order Alismatales. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, often appearing in clusters. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable. Lemna perpusilla thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
