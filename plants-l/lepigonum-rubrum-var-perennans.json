    "intro": "Lepigonum rubrum var. perennans, commonly known as red stemmed gothics, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It features striking red stems and clusters of small, showy pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its foliage is typically green with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
