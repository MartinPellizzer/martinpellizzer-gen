It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually ovate with hairy surfaces, and the fruit is a small, green, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. Lycianthes reflexa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in folk medicine."
