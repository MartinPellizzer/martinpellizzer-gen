    "intro": "Leuzea lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf tarragon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a silvery-green appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its aromatic leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though it is not as widely cultivated as common tarragon."
