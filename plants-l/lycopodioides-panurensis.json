    "intro": "Lycopodioides panurensis, commonly known as the Panurensis clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and linear, needle-like leaves. Native to the Andean regions of South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the base of the plant, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
