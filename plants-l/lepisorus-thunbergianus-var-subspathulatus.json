    "intro": "Lepisorus thunbergianus var. subspathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea, where it typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a compact, creeping growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems that produce clusters of small, bright green leaves. Its spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
