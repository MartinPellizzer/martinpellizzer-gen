    "intro": "Lophanthus subnivalis var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered alpine bellflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
