It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lomanthes is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Its compact size and aesthetic appeal make it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
