    "intro": "Lygodium chaerophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in moist forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
