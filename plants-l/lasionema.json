    "intro": "Lasionema, commonly known as the needleleaf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and pinnately compound leaves that resemble pine needles. They produce large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Lasionema species are typically slow-growing and require well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Due to habitat loss, many species are threatened with extinction."
