    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. pectinata, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a pinnate structure, and its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
