    "intro": "Lissochilus corbisieri, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive corolla structure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lissochilus corbisieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with partial shade."
