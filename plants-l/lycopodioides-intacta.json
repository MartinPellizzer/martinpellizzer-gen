    "intro": "Lycopodioides intacta, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodioides intacta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
