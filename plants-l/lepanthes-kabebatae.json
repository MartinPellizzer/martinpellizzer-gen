It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic.

Lepanthes kabebatae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
