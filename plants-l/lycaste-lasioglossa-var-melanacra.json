It is characterized by its dark purple to black sepals and petals, with a contrasting yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but challenging species for cultivation."
