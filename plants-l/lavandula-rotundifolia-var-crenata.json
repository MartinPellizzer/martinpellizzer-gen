It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with rounded, slightly wavy leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of purple flowers in the summer, which are highly fragrant and used in perfumery and aromatherapy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both garden and landscape design."
