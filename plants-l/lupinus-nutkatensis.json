    "intro": "Lupinus nutkatensis, commonly known as the Nuttall's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Lupinus nutkatensis is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules. It plays an important ecological role in soil enrichment and provides nectar for pollinators."
