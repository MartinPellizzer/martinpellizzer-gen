    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis subrostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
