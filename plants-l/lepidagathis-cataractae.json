    "intro": "Lepidagathis cataractae, commonly known as the water lily of the Andes, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators like bees and beetles. Lepidagathis cataractae plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding water bodies."
