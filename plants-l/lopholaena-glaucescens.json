    "intro": "Lopholaena glaucescens, commonly known as the silver-leaved lopholaena, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Lopholaena glaucescens is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in appropriate environments."
