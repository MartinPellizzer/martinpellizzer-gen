    "intro": "Leandra horrida, commonly known as the horrid leandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Strelitziaceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves and showy, banana-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are pollinated by insects and birds. Leandra horrida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, moist climates."
