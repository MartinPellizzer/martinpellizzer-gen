    "intro": "Linanthus arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring and summer. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Linanthus arenicola is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, open habitats."
