    "intro": "Leucothoe editorum, commonly known as the purpleleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal blooms."
