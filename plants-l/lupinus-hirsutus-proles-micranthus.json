    "intro": "Lupinus hirsutus proles micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces spikes of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. Lupinus hirsutus proles micranthus has deep taproots that help stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it valuable for ecological restoration."
