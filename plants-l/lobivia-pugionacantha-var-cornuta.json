    "intro": "Lobivia pugionacantha var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal watering once established."
