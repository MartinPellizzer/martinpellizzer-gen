    "intro": "Lindsaea schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Lindsaea schomburgkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
