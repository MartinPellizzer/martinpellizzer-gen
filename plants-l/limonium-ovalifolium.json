It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium ovalifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
