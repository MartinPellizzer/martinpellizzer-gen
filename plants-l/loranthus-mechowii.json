    "intro": "Loranthus mechowii, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, alternate leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
