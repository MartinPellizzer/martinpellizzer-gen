    "intro": "Loxanthocereus gracilispinus, commonly known as the slender-spined night blooming cactus, is a species native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stem and sparse, sharp spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Its structure and flowering habits make it an adaptation to survive in extreme desert conditions."
