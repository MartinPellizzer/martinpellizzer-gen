It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale blue to white, with five petals and a distinct central yellow spot. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
