    "intro": "Leptoloma cognata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner. This variant is particularly adapted to survive in sandy soils with low moisture and high salinity. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions."
