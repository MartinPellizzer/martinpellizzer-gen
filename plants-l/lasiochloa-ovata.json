    "intro": "Lasiochloa ovata, commonly known as the oval hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Lasiochloa ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
