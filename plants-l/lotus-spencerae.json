    "intro": "Lotus spencerae, commonly known as the Spencers lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water depth. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, which is a key botanical feature. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments. Lotus spencerae is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
