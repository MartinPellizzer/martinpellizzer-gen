    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis flaveola subsp. ricoi, commonly known as the golden marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often emerging through snow-covered ground. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The subspecies ricoi is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and a more compact growth form compared to the typical variety."
