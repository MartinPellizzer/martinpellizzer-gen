    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
