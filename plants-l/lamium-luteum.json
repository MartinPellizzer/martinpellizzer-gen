    "intro": "Lamium luteum, commonly known as yellow deadnettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Yellow deadnettle is a low-growing perennial that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
