    "intro": "Lupinus paucartambensis, commonly known as the Andean lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of vibrant blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system has the ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus paucartambensis is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
