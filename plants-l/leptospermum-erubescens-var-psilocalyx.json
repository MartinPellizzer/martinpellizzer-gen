    "intro": "Leptospermum erubescens var. psilocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves contain high levels of essential oils, making it valuable for both medicinal and aromatic purposes. The variety is distinguished by its reduced calyx lobes, which are shorter and more narrow than in the typical form of the species."
