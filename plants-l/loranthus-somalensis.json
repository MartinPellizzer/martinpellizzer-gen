    "intro": "Loranthus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Horn of Africa. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as Acacia and Commiphora, through its haustellum, which penetrates the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. However, its parasitic nature can weaken its host trees if infestations are severe."
