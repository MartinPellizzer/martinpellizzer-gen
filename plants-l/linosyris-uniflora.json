    "intro": "Linosyris uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower linosyris, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Linosyris uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
