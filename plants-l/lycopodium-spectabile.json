    "intro": "Lycopodium spectabile, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like formations on the underside of the fronds. Lycopodium spectabile is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
