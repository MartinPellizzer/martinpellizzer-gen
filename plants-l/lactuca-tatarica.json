    "intro": "Lactuca tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It contains lactucin, a sesquiterpene lactone, which contributes to its bitter taste and has been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits."
