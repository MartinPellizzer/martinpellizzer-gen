It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, alpine environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lomatocarum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
