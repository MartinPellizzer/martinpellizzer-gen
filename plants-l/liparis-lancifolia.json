    "intro": "Liparis lancifolia, commonly known as the sword-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Liparis lancifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
