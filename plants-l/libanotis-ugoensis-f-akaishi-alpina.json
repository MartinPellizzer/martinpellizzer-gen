    "intro": "Libanotis ugoensis f. akaishi-alpina, commonly known as the Japanese alpine bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
