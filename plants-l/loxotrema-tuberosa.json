    "intro": "Loxotrema tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is usually pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various habitats. It is often found on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate and tropical regions. Loxotrema tuberosa is notable for its ability to tolerate environmental stress and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
