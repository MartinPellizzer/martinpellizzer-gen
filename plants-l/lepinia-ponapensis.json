    "intro": "Lepinia ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Ponap in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy white and pink flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Lepinia ponapensis is considered a vulnerable species."
