    "intro": "Leptochloa virgata var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
