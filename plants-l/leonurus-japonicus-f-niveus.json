    "intro": "Leonurus japonicus f. niveus, commonly known as the white horse-tail. This variant of the horse-tail plant is characterized by its pale or white flower spikes, which distinguish it from the typical green flowers of the species. It is a perennial herb native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
