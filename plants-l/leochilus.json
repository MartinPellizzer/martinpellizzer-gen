    "intro": "Leochilus, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Australia and are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures. The flowers typically feature a showy, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive lip. Leochilus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they rely on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their value in horticultural collections."
