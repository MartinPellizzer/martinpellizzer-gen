    "intro": "Lithocarpus blaoensis, commonly known as the Blao ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains one or two seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
