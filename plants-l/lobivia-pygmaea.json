    "intro": "Lobivia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lobivia, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and specific care to thrive in cultivation."
