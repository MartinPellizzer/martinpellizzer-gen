    "intro": "Leandra violascens, commonly known as the violet-flowered leandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their tubular shape and nectar-rich structure. Leandra violascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
