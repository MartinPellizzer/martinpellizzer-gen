    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum f. simplex, commonly known as the simple clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a dense appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological systems."
