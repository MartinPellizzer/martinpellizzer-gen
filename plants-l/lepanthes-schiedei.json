    "intro": "Lepanthes schiedei, commonly known as the Schied's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes schiedei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and striking appearance make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
