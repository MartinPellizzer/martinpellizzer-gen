    "intro": "Loranthus kimuenzae, commonly known as the Kimuen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the forests of East Africa. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as the African ebony, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered an important component of the forest ecosystem in its native habitat."
