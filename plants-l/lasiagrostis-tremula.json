    "intro": "Lasiagrostis tremula, commonly known as the trembling grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It features fine, silver-green blades that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Lasiagrostis tremula is often found in moist soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
