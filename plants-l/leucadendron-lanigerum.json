    "intro": "Leucadendron lanigerum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive and almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cone-like structures called infrutescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
