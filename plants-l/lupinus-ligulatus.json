    "intro": "Lupinus ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus ligulatus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
