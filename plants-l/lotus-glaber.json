    "intro": "Lotus glaber, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water and maintain buoyancy. Its roots system is extensive, anchoring it in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lotus glaber is also notable for its ability to thrive in both still and flowing water environments."
