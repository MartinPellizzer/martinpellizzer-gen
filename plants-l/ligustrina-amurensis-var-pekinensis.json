    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ligustrina amurensos var. pekinensis, commonly known as the Peking privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
