    "intro": "Loranthus zizyphifolius, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a glossy surface and a distinctive scent. Loranthus zizyphifolius is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in forested areas."
