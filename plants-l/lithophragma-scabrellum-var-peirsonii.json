It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving it a distinctive texture. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
