    "intro": "Loranthus exocarpi var. coccineus, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, and it produces red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various host trees."
