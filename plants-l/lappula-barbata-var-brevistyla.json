    "intro": "Lappula barbata var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled lappula, is a variant of the lappula species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in loose spikes, typically ranging in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. This variety is distinguished by its shorter styles compared to the typical form, a trait that may influence pollination dynamics. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
