    "intro": "Lonicera pilosa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which appear in late summer, are small and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Lonicera pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
