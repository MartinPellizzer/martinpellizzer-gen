    "intro": "Lupinus bakeri, commonly known as Baker's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, with several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus bakeri is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
