    "intro": "Lussa quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved lussa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of an oak tree, with lobed edges and a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Lussa quercifolia is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
