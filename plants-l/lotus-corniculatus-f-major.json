    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. major, commonly known as the greater bird's-beak, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved pods that resemble a bird's beak, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a typical pea-like structure, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and beneficial role in soil enrichment."
