    "intro": "Leptospermum umbellatum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
