    "intro": "Lepidium campestre var. glabrum, commonly known as field peppergrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, green, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is hairless. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits known as siliques. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. This plant is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
