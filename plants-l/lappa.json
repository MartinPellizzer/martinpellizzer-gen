    "intro": "Lappa, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems that exude a milky sap when broken. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic properties, it can be dangerous to handle."
