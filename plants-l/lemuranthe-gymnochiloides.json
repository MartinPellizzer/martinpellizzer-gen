    "intro": "Lemuranthe gymnochiloides, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
