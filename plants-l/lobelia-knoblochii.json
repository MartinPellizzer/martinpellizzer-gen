    "intro": "Lobelia knoblochii, commonly known as Knobloch's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
