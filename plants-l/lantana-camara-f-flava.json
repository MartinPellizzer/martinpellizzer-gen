    "intro": "Lantana camara f. flava, commonly known as yellow lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant is known for its high ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to native plant species."
