    "intro": "Leptotaenia minor, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has delicate, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Leptotaenia minor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
