    "intro": "Licania occultans, commonly known as the hidden licania, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or white, are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Licania occultans remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
