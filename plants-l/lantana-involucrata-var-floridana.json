    "intro": "Lantana involucrata var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often changing hue as they mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
