    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum f. skottsbergii, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a fern ally characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. It is native to southern South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its sporophytic structures are typically clustered at the base of the plant, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology that reflects its adaptation to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
