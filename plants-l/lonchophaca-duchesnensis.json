    "intro": "Lonchophaca duchesnensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Lonchophaca duchesnensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
