    "intro": "Lepanthes ophelma, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Lepanthes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive white and green coloration. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes ophelma is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in the warm, moist climates of the tropics."
