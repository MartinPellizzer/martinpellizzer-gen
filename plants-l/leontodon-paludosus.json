    "intro": "Leontodon paludosus, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is well adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, with specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates."
