    "intro": "Lecanocnide, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its toxic sap, which contains urushiol, a potent allergen. Lecanocnide is often found in moist, shaded areas and can grow as a vine or shrub. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to humans and animals."
