    "intro": "Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius subsp. fraxinifolius, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers arranged in drooping clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
