    "intro": "Lepanthes nycteris, commonly known as the night orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom at night, a feature that aligns with its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by nocturnal insects. Lepanthes nycteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of tropical rainforests."
