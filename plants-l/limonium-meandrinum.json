    "intro": "Limonium meandrinum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems. Limonium meandrinum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
