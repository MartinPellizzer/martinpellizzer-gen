    "intro": "Lasiandra frigidula, commonly known as the cold leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lasiandra frigidula is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
