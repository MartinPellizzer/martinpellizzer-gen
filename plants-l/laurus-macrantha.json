    "intro": "Laurus macrantha, commonly known as the large-leaved laurier or sweet bay, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that emit a pleasant aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Laurus macrantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and historical use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
