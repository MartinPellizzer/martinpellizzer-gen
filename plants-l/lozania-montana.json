    "intro": "Lozania montana, commonly known as the mountain lozania, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid climates. Lozania montana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
