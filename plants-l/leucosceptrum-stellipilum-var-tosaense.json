It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically evergreen, glossy, and elliptical in shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
