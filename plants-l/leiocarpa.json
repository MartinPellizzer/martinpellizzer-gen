    "intro": "Leiocarpa, commonly known as the yellow false truffle, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its smooth, yellowish cap and a slender, often curved stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on the soil surface in forested areas. It is saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling. While not edible, it is sometimes mistaken for edible truffles due to its appearance."
