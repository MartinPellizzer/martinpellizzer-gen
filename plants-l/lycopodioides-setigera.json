    "intro": "Lycopodioides setigera, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, which are typically clustered in a single umbel at the tip of each stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Lycopodioides setigera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
