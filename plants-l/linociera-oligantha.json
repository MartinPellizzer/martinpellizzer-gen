    "intro": "Linociera oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as Ficus species, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are small, oval, and often clustered, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds. Linociera oligantha plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
