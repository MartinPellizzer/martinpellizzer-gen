It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
