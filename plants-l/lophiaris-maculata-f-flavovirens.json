    "intro": "Lophiaris maculata f. flavovirens, commonly known as the golden green agave, is a unique variant of the agave genus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with a mix of green and yellow-green tones. The plant features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to yellow flowers, typical of the Agavaceae family. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
