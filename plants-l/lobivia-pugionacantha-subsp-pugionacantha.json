    "intro": "Lobivia pugionacantha subsp. pugionacantha, commonly known as the horned lobivia, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by bright red fruits. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lobivia pugionacantha subsp. pugionacantha is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
