    "intro": "Linnaea borealis var. pallida, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral color, which contrasts with the more commonly found pink or red-flowered forms of the species."
