The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green hues, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
