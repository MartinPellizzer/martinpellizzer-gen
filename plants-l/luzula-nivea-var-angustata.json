    "intro": "Luzula nivea var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Luzula nivea."
