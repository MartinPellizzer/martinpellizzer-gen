    "intro": "Limonium spicatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in saline or well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ornamental value. Limonium spicatum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
