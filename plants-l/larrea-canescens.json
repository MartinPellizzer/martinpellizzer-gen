    "intro": "Larrea canescens, commonly known as screwbean, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water. Larrea canescens is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
