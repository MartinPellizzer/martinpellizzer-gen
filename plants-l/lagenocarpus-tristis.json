    "intro": "Lagenocarpus tristis, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild apple, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling apples. The fruits are often bitter and contain a single seed, making them unsuitable for human consumption. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
