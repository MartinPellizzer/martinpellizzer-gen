It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, delicate florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and dunes, thriving in saline environments. It produces showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Limonium gougetianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to coastal conditions."
