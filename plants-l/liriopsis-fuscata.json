    "intro": "Liriopsis fuscata, commonly known as the dark grass or black grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
