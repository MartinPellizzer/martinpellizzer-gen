    "intro": "Lonicera tatarica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often trail or climb, making it suitable for trellises or ground cover. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
