    "intro": "Lycopodium rubricaule, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. Lycopodium rubricaule thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and scientific interest."
