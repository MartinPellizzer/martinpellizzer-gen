    "intro": "Lysimachia stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia stricta is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread via rhizomes."
