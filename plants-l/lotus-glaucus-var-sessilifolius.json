    "intro": "Lotus glaucus var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the pale lotus or sessile-leaved lotus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
