It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea mesarum is characterized by its unique morphology, with some species exhibiting a distinctive spiky appearance. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
