    "intro": "Lycopodioides oregana, commonly known as the Oregon clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that grows from a rhizome. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
