    "intro": "Lonas annua, commonly known as annual morning glory, is an herbaceous plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its rapid growth and heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
