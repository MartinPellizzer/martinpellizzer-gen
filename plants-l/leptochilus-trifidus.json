    "intro": "Leptochilus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
