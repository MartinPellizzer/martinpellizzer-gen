    "intro": "Lonchocarpus verrucosus, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces pods containing spherical, yellowish seeds. The plant is notable for its high nitrogen content, which makes it useful as a green manure crop. It also contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
