    "intro": "Lepanthes marthae, commonly known as the Martha's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes marthae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
