    "intro": "Lotus tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments. Lotus tetraptera plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
