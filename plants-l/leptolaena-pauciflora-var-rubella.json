    "intro": "Leptolaena pauciflora var. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered leptolaena, is a shrub native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
