    "intro": "Loranthus brunneus var. butayei, commonly known as the Butayev's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
