It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in the autumn, contrasting with the typical red or orange hues of its parent species. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces ornamental red berries that persist through winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin and unique floral display."
