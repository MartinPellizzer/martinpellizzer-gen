It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
