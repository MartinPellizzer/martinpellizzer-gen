    "intro": "Leptochilus decurrens subsp. hemionitideus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or shrubland habitats. The plant has slender, creeping stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments."
