    "intro": "Lysimachia multiflora, commonly known as the golden thread, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has thin, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance. Lysimachia multiflora thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, making it a common sight in riparian zones."
