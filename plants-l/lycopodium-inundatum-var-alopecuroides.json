    "intro": "Lycopodium inundatum var. alopecuroides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine, branched hairs that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically forms compact, spreading clumps with small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. The velvet fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
