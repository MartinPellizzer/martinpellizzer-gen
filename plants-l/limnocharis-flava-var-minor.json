    "intro": "Limnocharis flava var. minor, commonly known as the yellow water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, typically from spring to fall. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, rounded leaves that are often submerged. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a nuisance in aquatic ecosystems if not managed properly."
