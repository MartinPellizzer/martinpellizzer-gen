    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
