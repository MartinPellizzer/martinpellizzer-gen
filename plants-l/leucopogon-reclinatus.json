    "intro": "Leucopogon reclinatus, commonly known as the leaning heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heather. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. Leucopogon reclinatus plays a role in providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
