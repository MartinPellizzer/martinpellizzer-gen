    "intro": "Lygistum confertiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flower lygistum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
