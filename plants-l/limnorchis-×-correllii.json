    "intro": "Limnorchis \u00d7 correllii, commonly known as the hybrid water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant that results from the cross between Limnorchis fluitans and Limnorchis sanguinea. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are usually pale yellow and are borne in clusters near the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
