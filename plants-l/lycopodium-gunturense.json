    "intro": "Lycopodium gunturense, commonly known as the Guntur clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium gunturense is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
