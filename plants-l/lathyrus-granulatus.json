    "intro": "Lathyrus granulatus, commonly known as the rough vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus granulatus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
