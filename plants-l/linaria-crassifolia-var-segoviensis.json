It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
