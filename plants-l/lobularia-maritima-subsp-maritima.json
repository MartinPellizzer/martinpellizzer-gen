    "intro": "Lobularia maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as coastal candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. The plant has aromatic, fuzzy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
