    "intro": "Lobelia gruina subsp. gruina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lobelia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Lobelia gruina subsp. gruina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
