    "intro": "Lotus tristis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom on tall, slender stalks above the water surface. Its leaves are large, circular, and floating, with a waxy surface that repels water. The lotus is noted for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its ability to purify water through natural filtration."
