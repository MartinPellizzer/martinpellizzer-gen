    "intro": "Lindera pentantha, commonly known as sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Lindera pentantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
