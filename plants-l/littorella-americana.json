    "intro": "Littorella americana, commonly known as American marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in brackish or saltwater marshes, often in muddy or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Littorella americana is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and salinity."
