    "intro": "Lactuca azerbaijanica, commonly known as Azerbaijani lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Caucasus region, particularly Azerbaijan, and is characterized by its rosette of broad, wavy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, spiky fruits. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Lactuca azerbaijanica is valued for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste similar to other lettuce species."
