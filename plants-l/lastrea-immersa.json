    "intro": "Lastrea immersa, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has thick, waxy leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the water's surface, while its leaves float on top. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
