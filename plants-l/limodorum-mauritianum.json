    "intro": "Limodorum mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
