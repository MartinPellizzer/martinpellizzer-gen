    "intro": "Livistona tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin palm, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and southern China. It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, grayish trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Livistona tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for cultivation."
