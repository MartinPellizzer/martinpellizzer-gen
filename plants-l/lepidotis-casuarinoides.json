It has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, showing resilience to salt spray and drought. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
