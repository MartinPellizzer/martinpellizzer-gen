    "intro": "Lupinus magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalena lupine, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Lupinus magdalenensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
