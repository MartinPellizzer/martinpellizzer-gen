It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft pubescence, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
