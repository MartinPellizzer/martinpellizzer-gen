    "intro": "Lepidium cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf cress, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a small annual herb with distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments, such as sand dunes and rocky shores. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
