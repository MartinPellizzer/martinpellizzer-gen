    "intro": "Ligularia talassica, commonly known as the coastal ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and humid climates, though it is sensitive to drought and frost."
