    "intro": "Lethedon ciliaris, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It features fine, silver-tipped leaves that give it its distinctive appearance, and it typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its landscape. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small wildlife. Lethedon ciliaris is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
