    "intro": "Limonium articulatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium articulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
