    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus subsp. ingratus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and spiny, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
