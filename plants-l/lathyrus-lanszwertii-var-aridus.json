    "intro": "Lathyrus lanszwertii var. aridus, commonly known as the desert pea, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
