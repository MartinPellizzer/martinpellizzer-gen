    "intro": "Lespedeza formosa f. sericea, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a silky texture due to the fine hairs covering them. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
