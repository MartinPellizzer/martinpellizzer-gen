    "intro": "Leptolepia maxima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
