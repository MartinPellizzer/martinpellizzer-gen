It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
