    "intro": "Leptodaphne subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine leptodaphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
