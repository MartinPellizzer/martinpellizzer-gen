    "intro": "Lepidium gramineum, commonly known as field cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and somewhat grass-like in appearance. It produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
