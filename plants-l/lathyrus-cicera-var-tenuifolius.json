    "intro": "Lathyrus cicera var. tenuifolius, commonly known as slender-leaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range from pink to violet in color. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing one or two kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
