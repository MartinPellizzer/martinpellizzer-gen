    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red-leaf deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking red-veined foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to gardens. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its vibrant foliage, though it also attracts pollinators with its blossoms."
