    "intro": "Loxocarpus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, feathery foliage that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Loxocarpus littoralis is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating wind, salt spray, and periodic inundation."
