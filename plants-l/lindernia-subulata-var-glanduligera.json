    "intro": "Lindernia subulata var. glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular spikeweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern California. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
