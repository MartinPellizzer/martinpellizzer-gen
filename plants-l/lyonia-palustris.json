    "intro": "Lyonia palustris, commonly known as swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and moist woodlands, preferring acidic soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Lyonia palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
