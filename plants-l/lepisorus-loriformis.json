    "intro": "Lepisorus loriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed forest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Lepisorus loriformis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
