    "intro": "Lupinus tenuispicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, sparsely haired stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus tenuispicus is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
