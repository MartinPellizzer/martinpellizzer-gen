It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits with a thick, yellowish rind and a sour, acidic pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of citric acid. Limonia octandra thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
