    "intro": "Lonicera interrupta, commonly known as the redbank honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, which bloom in the spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Lonicera interrupta is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
