    "intro": "Lepidium deserti, commonly known as desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small annual herb with a compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and succulent to conserve moisture. Lepidium deserti has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is an important part of the local flora in desert ecosystems."
