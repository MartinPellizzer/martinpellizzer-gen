    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. eximea, commonly known as the silver mat fern, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
