    "intro": "Liriope spicata, commonly known as hardy lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a compact clump, and it produces upright, spike-like clusters of small, white or light blue flowers in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form attractive ground covers, while its ornamental value extends throughout the growing season."
