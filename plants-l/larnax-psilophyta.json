    "intro": "Larnax psilophyta, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lepidoziellales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright, spore-bearing cones. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Larnax psilophyta exhibits a unique reproductive structure with distinct sporophyte and gametophyte phases. Its simple morphology reflects its evolutionary position as a transitional form between non-vascular and more advanced vascular plants."
