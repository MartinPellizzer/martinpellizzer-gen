    "intro": "Laurus camphorata, commonly known as the camphor laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from its leaves and bark. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
