It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in shaded areas."
