    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas cardinalflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
