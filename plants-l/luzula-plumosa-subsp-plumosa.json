    "intro": "Luzula plumosa subsp. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, upright clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in cool, temperate climates. Luzula plumosa subsp. plumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
