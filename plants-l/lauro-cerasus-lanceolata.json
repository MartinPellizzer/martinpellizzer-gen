It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and have a pleasant aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Lauro-cerasus lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
