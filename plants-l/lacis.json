    "intro": "Lacis, commonly known as the lac insect, is a small, sap-sucking insect that produces a resinous substance called lac. This substance is harvested from the excretions of the insect and is used in various industries, including varnishes and jewelry. The plant associated with lacis is the tree species on which the insect feeds, such as the Indian lac tree (Ricinus communis). The botanical significance of lacis lies in its role as a natural resource and its ecological impact on the trees it inhabits. Its life cycle and secretion process are closely tied to the health and growth of the host plant."
