    "intro": "Limonium commune, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and silvery, strap-like leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium commune is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
