    "intro": "Loricalepis duckei, commonly known as the duck's foot fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which gives the plant its scientific name. Loricalepis duckei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes."
