It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
