It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and its ability to climb using aerial roots. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
