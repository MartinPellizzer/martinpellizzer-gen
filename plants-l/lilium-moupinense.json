    "intro": "Lilium moupinense, commonly known as the Moupin lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing bell-shaped or cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Its leaves are long and grass-like, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered an endangered species."
