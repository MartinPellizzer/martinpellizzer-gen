    "intro": "Lingnania intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lingnania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lingnania intermedia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded wetlands."
