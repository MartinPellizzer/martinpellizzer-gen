    "intro": "Leptogramma intermedia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
