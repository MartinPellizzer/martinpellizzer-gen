    "intro": "Leptoglottis confusa, commonly known as the New Zealand flat moss fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
