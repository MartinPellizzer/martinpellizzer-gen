    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment."
