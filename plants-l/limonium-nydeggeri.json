    "intro": "Limonium nydeggeri, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Limonium nydeggeri is often found in dunes and along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its blooming period typically occurs from late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to coastal landscapes."
