    "intro": "Lycopodium arbusculum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low mats. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are called strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear the spores. Lycopodium arbusculum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
