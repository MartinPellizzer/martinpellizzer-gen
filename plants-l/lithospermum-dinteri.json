    "intro": "Lithospermum dinteri, commonly known as Dinter's rock pepper, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
