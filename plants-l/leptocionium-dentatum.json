    "intro": "Leptocionium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a serrated or toothed margin, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures called thallus. Leptocionium dentatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
