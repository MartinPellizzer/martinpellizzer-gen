It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of purple or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often considered a weed in cultivated areas but has ornamental value in natural landscapes."
