    "intro": "Lepanthes huehuetenangensis, commonly known as the Huehuetenango orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Guatemala and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on trees. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and are often fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
