    "intro": "Lupinus pusillus var. barbiger, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its short stature and dense growth habit make it an attractive ground cover in gardens. Lupinus pusillus var. barbiger is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding plants."
