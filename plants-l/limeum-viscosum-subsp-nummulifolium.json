    "intro": "Limeum viscosum subsp. nummulifolium, commonly known as the nummulifolium limeum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, adding ornamental value. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its unique leaf structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
