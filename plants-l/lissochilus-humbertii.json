    "intro": "Lissochilus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it is found. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
