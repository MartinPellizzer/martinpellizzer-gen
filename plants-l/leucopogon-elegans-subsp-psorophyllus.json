    "intro": "Leucopogon elegans subsp. psorophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
