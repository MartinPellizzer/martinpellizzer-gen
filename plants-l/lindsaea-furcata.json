    "intro": "Lindsaea furcata, commonly known as the forked lindsaea, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic fern, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous short, branching stems that bear lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in pairs on the undersides of the leaves. Lindsaea furcata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
