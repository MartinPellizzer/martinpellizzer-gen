    "intro": "Lockhartia dipleura, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in successive shoots rather than from a single point. Its leaves are typically elongated and lance-shaped, providing a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil."
