    "intro": "Lindsaea obscura, commonly known as the dark lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cavity, which helps collect water and nutrients. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale flowers. Lindsaea obscura is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
