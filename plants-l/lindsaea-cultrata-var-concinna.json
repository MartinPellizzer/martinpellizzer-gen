    "intro": "Lindsaea cultrata var. concinna, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
