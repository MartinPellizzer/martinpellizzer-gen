    "intro": "Luehea tomentella, commonly known as the silky tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
