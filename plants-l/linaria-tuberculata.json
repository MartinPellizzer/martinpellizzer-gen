    "intro": "Linaria tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces bright yellow or orange flowers with two lips, characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear and covered in small, raised tubercles, giving it its common name. Linaria tuberculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
