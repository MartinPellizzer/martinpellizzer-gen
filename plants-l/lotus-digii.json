    "intro": "Lotus digii, commonly known as the African lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa. It features striking pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. Lotus digii is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in some cultures."
