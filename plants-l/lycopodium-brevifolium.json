    "intro": "Lycopodium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are short and narrow, contributing to its overall dense, moss-like appearance. Lycopodium brevifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
