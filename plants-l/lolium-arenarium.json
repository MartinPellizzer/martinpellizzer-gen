    "intro": "Lolium arenarium, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, two-lobed flowers. Lolium arenarium plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
