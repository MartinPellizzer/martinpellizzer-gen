    "intro": "Lithospermum tubatum, commonly known as the tuberous lithosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers during the summer months, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its unique appearance. Lithospermum tubatum is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments."
