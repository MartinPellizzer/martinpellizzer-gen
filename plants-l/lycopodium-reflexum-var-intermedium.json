    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along streams. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
