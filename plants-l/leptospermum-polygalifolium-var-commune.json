    "intro": "Leptospermum polygalifolium var. commune, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds. Its foliage is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine, and it is also cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is notable for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
