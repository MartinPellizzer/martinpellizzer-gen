    "intro": "Lomaria biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Lomaria biformis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
