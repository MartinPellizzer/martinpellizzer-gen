    "intro": "Lagarostrobos, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepper tree, is a unique evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain oily seeds, which are used in traditional Aboriginal practices. Lagarostrobos is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a rare and ecologically significant species. Its habitat is primarily restricted to the wetter regions of Tasmania, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
