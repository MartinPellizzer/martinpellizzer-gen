    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Lathyrus vestitus var. puberulus is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
