    "intro": "Loranthus glabriflorus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has woody stems and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered. Its leaves are lance-shaped and lack stipules, and it relies on its host for water and nutrients. The berries it produces are typically red or orange, containing adhesive seeds that aid in dispersal by birds."
