    "intro": "Lindera thomsonii var. vernayana, commonly known as the Thomson's spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats, often forming dense thickets. Its small, yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and emit a spicy scent when crushed."
