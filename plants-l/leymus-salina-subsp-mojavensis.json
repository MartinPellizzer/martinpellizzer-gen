    "intro": "Leymus salina subsp. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a key component of desert ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in environments with limited water availability. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in harsh desert conditions."
