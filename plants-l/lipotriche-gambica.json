    "intro": "Lipotriche gambica, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
