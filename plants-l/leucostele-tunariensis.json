    "intro": "Leucostele tunariensis, commonly known as the Tunari leucostele, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Euphobiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive anatomical features, including a leucostele, which is a type of vascular arrangement with a central bundle of xylem surrounded by a ring of phloem. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to the low light conditions of the dense forest canopy. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucostele tunariensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
