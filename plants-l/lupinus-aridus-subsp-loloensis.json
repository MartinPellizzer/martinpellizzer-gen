    "intro": "Lupinus aridus subsp. loloensis, commonly known as the Lolo Indian pea, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples."
