    "intro": "Leucothoe serrulata, commonly known as the serrated leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers appear in clusters during late spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The berries that follow are dark blue and remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing food for wildlife."
