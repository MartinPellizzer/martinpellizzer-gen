    "intro": "Lomaria patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's lomaria, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
