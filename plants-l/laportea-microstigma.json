    "intro": "Laportea microstigma, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive white or pale green underside, and are covered in fine hairs. Laportea microstigma thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
