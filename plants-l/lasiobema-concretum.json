    "intro": "Lasiobema concretum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
