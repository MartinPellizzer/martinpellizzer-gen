    "intro": "Lathyrus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and as a cover crop. Lathyrus hirtus is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
