    "intro": "Leucopogon insularis, commonly known as the island heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salt exposure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Leucopogon insularis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
