    "intro": "Luffa striata, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy, lightweight structures. These fruits are often used in cooking or as natural exfoliating tools due to their texture. Botanically, Luffa striata is characterized by its hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers."
