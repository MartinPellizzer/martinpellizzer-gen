    "intro": "Lepidurus incurvus, commonly known as the curled water flea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Anomopoda. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled body shape and is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant-like appearance of Lepidurus incurvus is due to its segmented exoskeleton, which resembles the structure of certain aquatic plants. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems as both a predator of small plankton and a prey species for larger organisms. Despite its name, it is not a plant but a crustacean, often mistaken for algae or other aquatic vegetation."
