    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed or toothed, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though the plant is generally more valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
