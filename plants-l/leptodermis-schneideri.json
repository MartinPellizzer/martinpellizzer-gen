It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, green stem covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Leptodermis schneideri is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
