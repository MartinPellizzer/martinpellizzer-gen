    "intro": "Lepechinia spicata, commonly known as silverleaf buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its silver-gray foliage is due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Lepechinia spicata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its low maintenance requirements."
