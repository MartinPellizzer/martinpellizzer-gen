    "intro": "Larrea tridentata subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are coated with a resinous substance that helps reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
