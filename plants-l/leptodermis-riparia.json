    "intro": "Leptodermis riparia, commonly known as the river lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is typically found growing on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in humid regions. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that is tightly adhered to the substrate. Leptodermis riparia plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
