    "intro": "Leptosiphon croceus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
