    "intro": "Lasiocladus chlorotrichos, commonly known as the green-haired cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, greenish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
