    "intro": "Luzula \u00d7 gayana, commonly known as the silver tuft grass, is a hybrid species within the plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of dense trichomes on its leaves. The plant typically forms compact clumps and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Luzula \u00d7 gayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
