    "intro": "Lathyrus ochraceus, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Lathyrus ochraceus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
