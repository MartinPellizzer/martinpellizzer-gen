    "intro": "Litsea salicifolia var. polyneura, commonly known as the Chinese-laurel or broad-leaved litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Litsea salicifolia. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in gardens and parks."
