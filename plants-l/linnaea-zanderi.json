    "intro": "Linnaea zanderi, commonly known as the Zander's twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its two small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaea zanderi is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
