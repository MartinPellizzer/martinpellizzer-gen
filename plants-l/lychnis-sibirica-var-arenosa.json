It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, xerophytic conditions."
