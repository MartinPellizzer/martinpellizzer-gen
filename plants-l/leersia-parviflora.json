    "intro": "Leersia parviflora, commonly known as small-flower sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetlands. Leersia parviflora plays a role in providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
