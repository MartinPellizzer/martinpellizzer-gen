It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Lagopus timbali is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
