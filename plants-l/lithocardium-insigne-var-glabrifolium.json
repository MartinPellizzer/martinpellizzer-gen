    "intro": "Lithocardium insigne var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, glabrous (hairless) leaves that form a compact cluster. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters along the stem, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
