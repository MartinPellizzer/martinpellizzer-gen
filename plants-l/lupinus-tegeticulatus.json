    "intro": "Lupinus tegeticulatus, commonly known as the slender lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Lupinus tegeticulatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
