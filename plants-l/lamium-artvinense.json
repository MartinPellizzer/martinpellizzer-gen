    "intro": "Lamium artvinense, commonly known as Artvin dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and opposite leaves. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
