    "intro": "Lecosia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf lecosia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae, which includes plants known for their ornamental and sometimes medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs on either side of the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lecosia oppositifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
