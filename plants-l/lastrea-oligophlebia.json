    "intro": "Lastrea oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined lastrea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has slender stems and narrow leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid native habitat. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
