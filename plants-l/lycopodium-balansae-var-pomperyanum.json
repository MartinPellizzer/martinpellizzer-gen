    "intro": "Lycopodium balansae var. pomperyanum, commonly known as the Pompeian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. This variant is notable for its historical association with the ancient city of Pompeii, where it was found preserved in volcanic ash."
