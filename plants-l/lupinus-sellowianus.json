    "intro": "Lupinus sellowianus, commonly known as Sellow's lupin, is a perennial legume native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus sellowianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
