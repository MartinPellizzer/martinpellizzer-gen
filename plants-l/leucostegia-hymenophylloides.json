    "intro": "Leucostegia hymenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a small, perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, bipinnate leaf structure and is part of the family Hymenophyllaceae."
