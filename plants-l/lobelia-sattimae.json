    "intro": "Lobelia sattimae, commonly known as the Sattima lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lobelia sattimae is considered a rare and endangered species."
