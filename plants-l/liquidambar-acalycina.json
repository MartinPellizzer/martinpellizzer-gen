    "intro": "Liquidambar acalycina, commonly known as the Mexican sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Aceraceae family, though it is now classified under the broader Betulaceae family. The tree is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a spherical, spiky capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
