    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 subnutans, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a hybrid perennial grass species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Timothy grass is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to many other regions, including North America. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in soil stabilization."
