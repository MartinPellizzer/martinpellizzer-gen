    "intro": "Leandra subulata, commonly known as the silverleaf leandra, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
