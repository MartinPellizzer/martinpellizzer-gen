    "intro": "Limniris odaesanensis, commonly known as the Odaesan water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its delicate, lace-like foliage makes it a unique addition to aquatic gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
