    "intro": "Lepanthes elusiva, commonly known as the elusive orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers that are often white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Lepanthes elusiva is noted for its fragrant blooms and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
