    "intro": "Lactuca repens, commonly known as the creeping lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant has lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers in clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. The plant is characterized by its ability to spread along the ground through its stolons, making it a common weed in cultivated areas."
