    "intro": "Limniris missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of the central United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a slight lavender tint. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Limniris missouriensis is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique adaptations to its wetland habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
