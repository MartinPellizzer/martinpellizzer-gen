    "intro": "Leiocarpus arborescens, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is characterized by its aerial roots, which help it anchor in tidal mud. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in mangrove forests."
