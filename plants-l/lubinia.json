These plants are characterized by their trumpet-shaped flowers, which often open in the morning and close in the evening. Lubinia species are typically herbaceous, with climbing or trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
