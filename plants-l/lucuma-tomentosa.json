    "intro": "Lucuma tomentosa, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp that resembles custard. The fruit is encased in a thick, leathery rind and contains several seeds. Lucuma is valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of beta-carotene and minerals, making it a popular ingredient in both traditional and modern cuisines."
