    "intro": "Leandra deflexa var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet leandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface and a slightly waxy texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
