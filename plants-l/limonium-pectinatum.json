    "intro": "Limonium pectinatum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Limonium pectinatum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting pollinator populations."
