    "intro": "Leidesia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping leidesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its small, white to pale green flowers appear in clusters during the spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
