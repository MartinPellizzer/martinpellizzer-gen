    "intro": "Ligularia stenocephala var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved ligularia, is a striking perennial plant native to East Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a bold, tropical look in shaded garden beds."
