    "intro": "Lecythis platycarpa, commonly known as the Amazonian oil tree, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, smooth, dark green leaves and produces distinctive, woody fruits that contain a rich oil used for various purposes. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense canopy, contributing to the forest's biodiversity. Its flowers are yellow and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies and beetles. The plant is also valued for its durable wood and has cultural significance among indigenous communities."
