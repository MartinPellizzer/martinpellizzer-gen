The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, and the plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
