    "intro": "Lunaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered moonflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, resembling tiny, rounded cups that split open to release tiny, lens-shaped seeds. Lunaria parviflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
