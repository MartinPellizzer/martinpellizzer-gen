    "intro": "Lepidium culminicola, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation for survival in its harsh environment. Lepidium culminicola thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
