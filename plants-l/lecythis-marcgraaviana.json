It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a heavy, oily fruit with a hard, woody seed. The tree is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its fruit is also edible, though the pulp is typically consumed fresh or fermented. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
