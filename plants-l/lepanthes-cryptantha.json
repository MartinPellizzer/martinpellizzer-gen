    "intro": "Lepanthes cryptantha, commonly known as the hidden orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for nutrients rather than soil. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Lepanthes cryptantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
