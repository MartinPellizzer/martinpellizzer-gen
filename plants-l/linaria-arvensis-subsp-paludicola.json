    "intro": "Linaria arvensis subsp. paludicola, commonly known as the marsh toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
