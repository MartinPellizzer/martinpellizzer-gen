    "intro": "Lantana ruiz-teranii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming throughout the year. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various coastal and inland environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
