    "intro": "Lannea, commonly known as the African lac tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to eastern and southern Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The tree is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Lannea species are valued for their ability to produce a resinous sap used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural lac. The genus includes several species, such as Lannea microcarpa and Lannea ferruginea, which are often found in dry forest and woodland habitats."
