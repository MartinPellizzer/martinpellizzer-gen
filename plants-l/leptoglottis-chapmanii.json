    "intro": "Leptoglottis chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's sword fern, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
