    "intro": "Laelia dawsonii f. chilapensis, commonly known as the Chilap\u00e9nensis laelia, is a rare orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its high-altitude, arid environment. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
