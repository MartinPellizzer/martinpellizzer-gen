    "intro": "Lentibularia, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are often found in wetland environments. They are notable for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often relying on symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Some species of Lentibularia are carnivorous, using specialized structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The genus includes both terrestrial and aquatic species, showcasing a wide range of ecological adaptations."
