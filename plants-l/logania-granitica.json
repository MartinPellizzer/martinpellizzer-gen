    "intro": "Logania granitica, commonly known as the granite logania, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often on granite outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Logania granitica is considered a vulnerable species."
