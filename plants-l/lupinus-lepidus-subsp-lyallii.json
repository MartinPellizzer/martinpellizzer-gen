    "intro": "Lupinus lepidus subsp. lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus lepidus subsp. lyallii plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules."
