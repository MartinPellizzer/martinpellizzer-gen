    "intro": "Linaria microcalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Linaria microcalyx is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
