    "intro": "Leiotulus involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
