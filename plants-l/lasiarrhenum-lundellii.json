    "intro": "Lasiarrhenum lundellii, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on rock surfaces, especially on sandstone, in arid and semi-arid environments. The thallus is leathery and dark brown to black in color, with a finely granular texture. It lacks distinct medulla and is composed of a dense cortex. This lichen is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
