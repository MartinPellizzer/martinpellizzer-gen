It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a shallow root system to thrive in harsh desert conditions. Leptocereus ekmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
