    "intro": "Leptorkis montana, commonly known as the mountain leptorkis, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss in arid conditions. Leptorkis montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
