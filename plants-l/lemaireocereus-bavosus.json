    "intro": "Lemaireocereus bavosus, commonly known as the Bavarian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
