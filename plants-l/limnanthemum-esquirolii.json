    "intro": "Limnanthemum esquirolii, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, while its leaves and flowers float on the water. Limnanthemum esquirolii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
