It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
