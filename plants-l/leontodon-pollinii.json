    "intro": "Leontodon pollinii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it blooms during the short summer season. Leontodon pollinii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
