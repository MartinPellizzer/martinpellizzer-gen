    "intro": "Leaoa monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its solitary, large, fan-shaped leaf that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
