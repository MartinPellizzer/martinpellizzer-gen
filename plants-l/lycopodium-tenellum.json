    "intro": "Lycopodium tenellum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its production of spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and its sporophytic structures are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodium tenellum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
