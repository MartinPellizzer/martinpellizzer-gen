    "intro": "Loranthus mbogaensis, commonly known as the East African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of East Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its leaves. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating its spread."
