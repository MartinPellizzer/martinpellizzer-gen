It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in terminal spikes. Lysimachia maxima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
