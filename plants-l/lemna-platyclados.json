    "intro": "Lemna platyclados, commonly known as the broad-leafed duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its flat, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. The plant reproduces vegetatively through the production of daughter plants that detach from the parent plant. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can form dense mats on the water surface, impacting water quality and light penetration."
