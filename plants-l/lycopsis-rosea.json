    "intro": "Lycopsis rosea, commonly known as the pink moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy stem and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of non-vascular plants. Lycopsis rosea is often found in forest floors and rock crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
