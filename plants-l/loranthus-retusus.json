    "intro": "Loranthus retusus, commonly known as the rough or smooth mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fabaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
