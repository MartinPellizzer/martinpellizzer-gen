    "intro": "Lippia plicata, commonly known as Mexican mint or lemon verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and thrives in subtropical climates. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their citrus-like scent. Lippia plicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
