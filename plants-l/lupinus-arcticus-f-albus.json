It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive blue to white flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This variety is notable for its pale coloration, which sets it apart from other lupine species."
