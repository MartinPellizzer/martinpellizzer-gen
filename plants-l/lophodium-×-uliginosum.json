    "intro": "Lophodium \u00d7 uliginosum, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a thallus made up of the fungal mycelium and algal cells. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat. Due to its sensitive nature, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and air quality."
