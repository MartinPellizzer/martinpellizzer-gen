    "intro": "Lettsomia roseopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-rose bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple petals that resemble bells, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss. Lettsomia roseopurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
