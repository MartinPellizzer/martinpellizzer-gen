    "intro": "Lepidium graminifolium, commonly known as slender cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and moist woodlands. Lepidium graminifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
