    "intro": "Lonchocarpus pedunculatus, commonly known as the red root or Brazilian bean, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its root system is notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties. Due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
