    "intro": "Leucadendron muirii, commonly known as the yellow fire bush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is known for its showy inflorescences and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the bright yellow floral displays. Leucadendron muirii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
