    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum subsp. monostachyon, commonly known as the club moss, is a small evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing strobila, which is typically clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant has a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which produces spores in a spiral arrangement. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological succession make it an ecologically significant species."
