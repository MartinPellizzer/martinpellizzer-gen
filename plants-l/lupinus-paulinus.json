    "intro": "Lupinus paulinus, commonly known as the Pauline lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and has a deep taproot system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus paulinus is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
