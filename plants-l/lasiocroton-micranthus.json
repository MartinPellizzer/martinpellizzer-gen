    "intro": "Lasiocroton micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
