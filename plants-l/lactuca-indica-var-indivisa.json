    "intro": "Lactuca indica var. indivisa, commonly known as the wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant contains lactucopicrin and other lactucin compounds, which contribute to its mild sedative effects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a subject of botanical study and a plant with historical use in traditional medicine."
