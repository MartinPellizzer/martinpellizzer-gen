    "intro": "Luetkea caespitosa elatior, commonly known as the greater marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist habitats. Luetkea caespitosa elatior plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
