    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. cryptanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine with cryptic flowers, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, sparsely branched inflorescences. The flowers are typically pale blue to white, with a prominent yellow keel. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
