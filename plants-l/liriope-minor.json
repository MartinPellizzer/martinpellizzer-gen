    "intro": "Liriope minor, commonly known as woodland lily or false lily, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features grass-like, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in late summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Liriope minor is also valued for its ability to spread and form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent erosion."
