    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum var. saxatile, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its unique morphology includes a rosette of leaves surrounding a central flower head, which is typical of the genus Leontopodium. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh conditions."
