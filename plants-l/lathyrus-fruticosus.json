    "intro": "Lathyrus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus fruticosus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
