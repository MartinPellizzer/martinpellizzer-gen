    "intro": "Lasiocarpus multiflorus, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray foliage that provides ornamental value throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens, borders, or as a foundation plant."
