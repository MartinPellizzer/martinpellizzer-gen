    "intro": "Lobelia tsotsorogensis, commonly known as the Transkei lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's semi-arid climate. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
