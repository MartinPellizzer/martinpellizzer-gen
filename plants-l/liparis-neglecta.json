    "intro": "Liparis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat overlooked species in the orchid family."
