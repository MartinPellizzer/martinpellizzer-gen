    "intro": "Lippia jangadensis var. eitenorum, commonly known as the Eiten's lippia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is well adapted to dry climates, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in rocky areas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The species is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
