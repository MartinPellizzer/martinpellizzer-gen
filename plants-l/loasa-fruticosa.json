    "intro": "Loasa fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow loasa, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Loasa fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
