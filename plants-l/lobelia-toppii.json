    "intro": "Lobelia toppii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and stream banks. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Lobelia toppii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
