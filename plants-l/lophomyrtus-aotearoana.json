    "intro": "Lophomyrtus aotearoana, commonly known as the Kauri miro, is a rare and endangered New Zealand native plant belonging to the Myrtaceae family. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is typically found in the understorey of temperate rainforests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
