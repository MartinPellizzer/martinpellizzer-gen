    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lithops dinteri var. fredericiii, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a species of succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, rock-like appearance, with two closely fused, fleshy leaves that mimic the surrounding environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
