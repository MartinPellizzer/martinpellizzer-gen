    "intro": "Lomelosia graminifolia subsp. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like lomelosia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
