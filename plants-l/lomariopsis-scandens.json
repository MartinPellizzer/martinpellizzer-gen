    "intro": "Lomariopsis scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with rhizomes that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are typically bright green. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Lomariopsis scandens thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests or shaded areas with high moisture levels."
