    "intro": "Leontopodium schlothauerae, commonly known as the Schlothauer's edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky slopes and meadows. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
