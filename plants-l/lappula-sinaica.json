It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and succulent leaves adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Lappula sinaica plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments."
