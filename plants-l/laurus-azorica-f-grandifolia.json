    "intro": "Laurus azorica f. grandifolia, commonly known as the Azorean laurel, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the Azores. It features broad, dark green, leathery leaves that are aromatic and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
