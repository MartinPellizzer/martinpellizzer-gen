    "intro": "Limonium cornusianum, commonly known as the Cornish sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal cliffs. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Limonium cornusianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
