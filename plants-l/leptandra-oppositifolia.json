    "intro": "Leptandra oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native plant gardens."
