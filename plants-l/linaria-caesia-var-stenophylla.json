    "intro": "Linaria caesia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
