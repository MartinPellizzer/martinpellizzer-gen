    "intro": "Limonium sedodes, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species in stabilizing sandy environments. Limonium sedodes is also popular in gardens for its ornamental value and drought resistance."
