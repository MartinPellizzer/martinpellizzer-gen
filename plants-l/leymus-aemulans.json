    "intro": "Leymus aemulans, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Leymus aemulans is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
