    "intro": "Lampranthus lewisiae, commonly known as the Lewisia's ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
