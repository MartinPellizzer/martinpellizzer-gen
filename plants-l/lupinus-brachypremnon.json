    "intro": "Lupinus brachypremnon, commonly known as the short-stemmed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces upright spikes of blue to purple flowers. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Lupinus brachypremnon plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
