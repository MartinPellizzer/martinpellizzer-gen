    "intro": "Lepanthes zygion, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking inflorescence of pink to purple flowers that resemble a cascade of tiny bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes zygion is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
