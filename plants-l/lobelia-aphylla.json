    "intro": "Lobelia aphylla, commonly known as the nakedleaf lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves on the flowering stems, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Lobelia aphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
