    "intro": "Lannea stuhlmannii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white stembark tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy bark that gives it a distinctive appearance and provides protection against fire and herbivory. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a fine, white pubescence, contributing to its tomentose appearance. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
