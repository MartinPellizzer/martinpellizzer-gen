    "intro": "Lupinus albifrons var. austromontanus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding plant life."
