    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. flammea, commonly known as the flame twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers, which contrast sharply with its typically green foliage. This subspecies is native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces delicate, two-lipped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical interest lies in its unique coloration and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
