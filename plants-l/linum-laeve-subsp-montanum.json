    "intro": "Linum laeve subsp. montanum, commonly known as mountain flax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or white flowers with showy, spurred petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its fibrous stems and seeds have been historically used for textile and culinary purposes."
