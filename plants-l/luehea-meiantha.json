    "intro": "Luehea meiantha, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that help it breathe in waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its small, white flowers are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Luehea meiantha plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life."
