    "intro": "Leptospermum marginatum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other leptospermum species."
