    "intro": "Limniris longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often at night. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for aquatic life and help in water filtration. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Limniris longipetala plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetlands."
