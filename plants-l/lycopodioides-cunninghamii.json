    "intro": "Lycopodioides cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
