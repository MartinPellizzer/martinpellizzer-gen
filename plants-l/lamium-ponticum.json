    "intro": "Lamium ponticum, commonly known as greater dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium ponticum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
