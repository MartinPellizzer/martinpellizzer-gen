It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with dense clusters of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage often exhibits a reddish or rusty hue, particularly on the underside, which gives it its common name."
