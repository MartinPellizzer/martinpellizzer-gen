It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small toadflax flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant. Linaria circinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
