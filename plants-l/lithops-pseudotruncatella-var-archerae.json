It features thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rocky appearance. It requires minimal water and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique morphology and low maintenance make it a fascinating subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
