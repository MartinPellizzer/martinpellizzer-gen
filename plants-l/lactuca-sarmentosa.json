    "intro": "Lactuca sarmentosa, commonly known as wild lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lactuca sarmentosa contains lactucopicrin and other sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its mild sedative properties."
