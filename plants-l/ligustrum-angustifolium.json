    "intro": "Ligustrum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
