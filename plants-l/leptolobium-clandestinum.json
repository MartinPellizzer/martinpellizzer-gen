    "intro": "Leptolobium clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden lobe balm, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
