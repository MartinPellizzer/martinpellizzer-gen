    "intro": "Lamiella, commonly known as the velvet fungus, is a genus of fungi in the family Lamiellaceae. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood, where they play a role in decomposition. Lamiella species are characterized by their dense, velvety, and often colorful fruiting bodies. They are generally small to medium in size and have a distinctive, almost sponge-like texture. While not plants, they are often mistaken for lichens or other fungi due to their appearance."
