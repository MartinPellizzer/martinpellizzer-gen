    "intro": "Leontodon alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Leontodon alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and serves as a food source for various pollinators."
