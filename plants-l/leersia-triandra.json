It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and pointed, with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered together.
