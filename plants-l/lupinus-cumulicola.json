It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus cumulicola plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
