It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that give it a lush, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The leaves are rich in chlorophyll, contributing to its role in photosynthesis and ecological balance."
