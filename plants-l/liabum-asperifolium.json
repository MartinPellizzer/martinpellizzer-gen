    "intro": "Liabum asperifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf liabum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in its native ecosystem."
