    "intro": "Lankesterella costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican starfish plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies, and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically brightly colored to attract pollinators. Lankesterella costaricensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
