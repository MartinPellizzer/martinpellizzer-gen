    "intro": "Lycopodium coriaceum, commonly known as the leatherleaf clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branching stems. Lycopodium coriaceum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
