It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lipochaeta setosa is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
