    "intro": "Launaea glabra, commonly known as the smooth launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Launaea glabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
