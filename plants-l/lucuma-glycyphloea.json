It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive yellow-orange fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it has a sweet, nutty flavor with a texture similar to a mix between a pear and a banana. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is valued not only for its unique taste but also for its traditional use in Andean cuisine and medicine."
