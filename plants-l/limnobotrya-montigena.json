    "intro": "Limnobotrya montigena, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit. The plant typically features a single, upright stem with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pale pink or white coloration, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Limnobotrya montigena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
