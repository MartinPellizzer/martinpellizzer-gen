    "intro": "Lepidophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf dewflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are often clustered in umbels, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, which contribute to its common name. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southern United States. They are often found in rocky or limestone soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
