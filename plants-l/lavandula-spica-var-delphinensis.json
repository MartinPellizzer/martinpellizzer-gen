    "intro": "Lavandula spica var. delphinensis, commonly known as Delphinian lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, spike-like inflorescences composed of purple or blue-gray flowers. The leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and mild lavender scent, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lavender species."
