    "intro": "Lycopodium polytrichoides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and simple, linear leaves. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or rocky areas. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle, with a distinct gametophyte stage that is often small and short-lived. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, consisting of a stem with whorled leaves and strobila that produce spores. Lycopodium polytrichoides plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
