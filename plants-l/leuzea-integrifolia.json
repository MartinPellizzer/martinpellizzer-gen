    "intro": "Leuzea integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf leuzea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth-edged and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Leuzea integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
