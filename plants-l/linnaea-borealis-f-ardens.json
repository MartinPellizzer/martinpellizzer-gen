    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. ardens, commonly known as the fiery twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. This form is distinguished by its vivid orange-red flowers, which contrast sharply with the typical white or pink blooms of the species. The botanical features include small, heart-shaped leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in coniferous or mixed forests. The plant's unique coloration makes it a notable subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
