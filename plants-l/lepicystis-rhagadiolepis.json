    "intro": "Lepicystis rhagadiolepis, commonly known as the desert candelabra cactus, is a unique plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candlestick, which help it store water and withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Lepicystis rhagadiolepis is well adapted to extreme climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
