It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
