    "intro": "Lepsia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy lepsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Lepsia foliosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
