    "intro": "Labourdonnaisia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the island's unique climate. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species."
