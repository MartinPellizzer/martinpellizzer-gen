    "intro": "Licania membranacea, commonly known as the membranous licania, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, lowland environments. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with large, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Licania membranacea is often found in secondary forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
