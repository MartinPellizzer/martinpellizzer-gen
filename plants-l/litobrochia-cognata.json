    "intro": "Litobrochia cognata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color and often has a leathery texture. This lichen is commonly found growing on rocks, especially in shaded, moist environments. It plays an important role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Litobrochia cognata is also used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
