    "intro": "Luzula parviflora subsp. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
