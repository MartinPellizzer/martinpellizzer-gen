    "intro": "Languas microlophon, commonly known as the small-lobed fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
