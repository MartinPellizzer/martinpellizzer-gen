    "intro": "Linum rupestre var. cymosulum, commonly known as the rock flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun exposure. Linum rupestre var. cymosulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
