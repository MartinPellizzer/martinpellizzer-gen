    "intro": "Lappago occidentalis, commonly known as the western lappago, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Lappago occidentalis plays a minor but important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its arid environment."
