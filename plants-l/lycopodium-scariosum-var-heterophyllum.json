    "intro": "Lycopodium scariosum var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyllous clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphological variation, where different parts of the plant exhibit distinct leaf shapes, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and thrives in temperate climates. Its sporophyte stage consists of a creeping stem with scale-like leaves, and it produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila. This variation in leaf morphology is an adaptation that may enhance its survival in diverse microhabitats."
