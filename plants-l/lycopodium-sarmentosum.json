    "intro": "Lycopodium sarmentosum, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils. Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
