    "intro": "Landoltia punctata, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has bright yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are usually submerged, though some may emerge above water. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Landoltia punctata is often found in association with other aquatic plants and plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
