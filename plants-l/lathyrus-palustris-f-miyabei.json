    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris f. miyabei, commonly known as the Miyabei marsh vetch, is a rare and ornamental variant of the marsh vetch. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, showcasing slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The foliage is usually alternate, with trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This form is notable for its unique floral structure and is valued in botanical gardens for its ecological and aesthetic significance. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
