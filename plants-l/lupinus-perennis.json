    "intro": "Lupinus perennis, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves composed of three to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, hard seeds. Lupinus perennis is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
