    "intro": "Leptecophylla juniperina subsp. oxycedrus, commonly known as the Cyprus cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the island of Cyprus. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely arranged. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
