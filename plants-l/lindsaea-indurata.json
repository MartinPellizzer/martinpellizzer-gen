    "intro": "Lindsaea indurata, commonly known as the hardy lindsaea, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Native to regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Lindsaea indurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
