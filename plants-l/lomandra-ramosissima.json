    "intro": "Lomandra ramosissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Lomandra ramosissima is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
