    "intro": "Liparis neuroglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
