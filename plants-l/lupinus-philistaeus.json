    "intro": "Lupinus philistaeus, commonly known as the Philistine lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Lupinus philistaeus is often found in coastal and semi-arid habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
