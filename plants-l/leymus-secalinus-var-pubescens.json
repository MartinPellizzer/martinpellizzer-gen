    "intro": "Leymus secalinus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, pubescent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in forage agriculture and ecological restoration projects."
