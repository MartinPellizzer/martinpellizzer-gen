    "intro": "Landolphia elliptica, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, lantern-like flowers that open at night. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
