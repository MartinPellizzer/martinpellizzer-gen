    "intro": "Lemaireocereus griseus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry environments. Lemaireocereus griseus is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun."
