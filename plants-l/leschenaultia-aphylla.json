It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the stem bearing the flowers directly. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
