    "intro": "Lactaria kilneri, commonly known as the kilner's milk cap, is a species of bolete fungus characterized by its distinctive cap and stem. It belongs to the family Boletaceae and is found in various regions of Europe. The fruiting bodies typically have a pale yellow to brown cap that becomes darker with age, while the stem is usually lighter in color. The pores of Lactaria kilneri are yellow and do not change color when bruised, a key identifying feature. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in forest soils, and is often found in association with coniferous trees."
