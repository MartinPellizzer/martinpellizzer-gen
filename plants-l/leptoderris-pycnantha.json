    "intro": "Leptoderris pycnantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
