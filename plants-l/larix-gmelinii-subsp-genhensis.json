    "intro": "Larix gmelinii subsp. genhensis, commonly known as the Korean larch, is a subspecies of the larch tree native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous conifer that produces cone-like structures containing winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree has needle-like leaves that turn yellow in the fall before shedding, and its bark is typically reddish-brown with a flaky texture. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
