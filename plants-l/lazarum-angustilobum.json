    "intro": "Lazarum angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rocks and tree bark in various environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
