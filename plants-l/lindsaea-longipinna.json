    "intro": "Lindsaea longipinna, commonly known as the long-needle lindsaea, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Lindsaea longipinna is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
