    "intro": "Lantana salicifolia, commonly known as silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can be invasive in some areas, posing a challenge to native plant species."
