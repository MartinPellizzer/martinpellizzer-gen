    "intro": "Leocereus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The genus includes several species, such as Leocereus triangularis and Leocereus trigonus, which are often cultivated for their unique appearance. These plants are typically epiphytic, growing on other plants or rocks, and require well-draining soil and minimal water. Their nocturnal blooming habit makes them a fascinating subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts."
