    "intro": "Leposma, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs with distinctive, often showy flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Leposma species are adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or alpine environments. Their flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they play an important role in the ecological systems of their native habitats."
