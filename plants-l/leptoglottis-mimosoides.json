    "intro": "Leptoglottis mimosoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kauri. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy berries. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
