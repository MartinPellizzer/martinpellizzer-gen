    "intro": "Leiboldia leiboldiana, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
