    "intro": "Litostigma coriaceifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved litostigma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Litostigma coriaceifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats where it thrives under harsh climatic conditions."
