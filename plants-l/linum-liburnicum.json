    "intro": "Linum liburnicum, commonly known as the Balkan flax, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces blue or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fibrous seeds are used for both ornamental and practical purposes, while the plant itself is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Linum liburnicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
