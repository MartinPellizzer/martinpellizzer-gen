    "intro": "Limnophila punctata var. subracemosa, commonly known as water willow or marsh willow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in loose, raceme-like inflorescences and are usually pale green to yellowish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
