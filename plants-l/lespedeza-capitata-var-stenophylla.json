    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist to mesic habitats, such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
