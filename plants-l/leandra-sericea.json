It is characterized by its delicate, silky-textured leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leandra sericea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific tropical conditions."
