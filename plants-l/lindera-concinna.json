    "intro": "Lindera concinna, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange-red berries that mature in the fall. Its aromatic foliage and showy fruit make it an ornamental plant, while its leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal uses. Lindera concinna thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
