    "intro": "Lavoisiera minor, commonly known as the lesser lavoisiera, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
