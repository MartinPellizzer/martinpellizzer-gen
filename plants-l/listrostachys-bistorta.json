    "intro": "Listrostachys bistorta, commonly known as bistort, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, often hairy stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pinkish-purple to red flower spikes that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. Bistort is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
