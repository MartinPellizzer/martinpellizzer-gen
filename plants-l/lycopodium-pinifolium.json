    "intro": "Lycopodium pinifolium, commonly known as the pine fern, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a prostrate or erect stem with simple, linear leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. Lycopodium pinifolium reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
