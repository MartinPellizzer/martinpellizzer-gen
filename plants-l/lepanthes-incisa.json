    "intro": "Lepanthes incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Lepanthes incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
