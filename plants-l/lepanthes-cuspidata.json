    "intro": "Lepanthes cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shaded environments. Lepanthes cuspidata is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical regions."
