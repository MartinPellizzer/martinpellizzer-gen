    "intro": "Lomandra spicata, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale blue flowers, which are pollinated by insects. It is adapted to sandy or coastal soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal landscapes. Lomandra spicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
