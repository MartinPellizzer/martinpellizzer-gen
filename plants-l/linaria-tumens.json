    "intro": "Linaria tumens, commonly known as the swollen toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. Linaria tumens is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
