It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to native plant landscapes."
