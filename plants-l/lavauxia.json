    "intro": "Lavauxia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to rocky and arid environments, Lavauxia is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The plant is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia."
