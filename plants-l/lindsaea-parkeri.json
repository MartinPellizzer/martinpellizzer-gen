    "intro": "Lindsaea parkeri, commonly known as the silver sprout fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense clusters. Lindsaea parkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
