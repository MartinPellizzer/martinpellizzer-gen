    "intro": "Licuala leprosa, commonly known as the yellow-veined palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves with prominent yellow veins, which give it its common name. It typically grows in wet tropical lowland areas, often near water bodies. The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage."
