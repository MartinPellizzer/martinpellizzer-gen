    "intro": "Lobivia klusacekii, commonly known as the Klusacek's lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a low-growing, compact plant that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
