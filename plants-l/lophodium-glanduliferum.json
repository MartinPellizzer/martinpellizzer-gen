    "intro": "Lophodium glanduliferum, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Lophodium glanduliferum is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where it thrives in full sun."
