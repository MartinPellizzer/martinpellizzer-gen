    "intro": "Loranthus hallieri, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a unique symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters, thriving in temperate and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
