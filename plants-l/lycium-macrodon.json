    "intro": "Lycium macrodon, commonly known as the large-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible when ripe, though they are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Lycium macrodon is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
