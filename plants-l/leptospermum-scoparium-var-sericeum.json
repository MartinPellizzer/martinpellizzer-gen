    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. sericeum, commonly known as silver matweed, is a variant of the native New Zealand tea tree. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Its small white or yellowish flowers appear in spring and are followed by red or orange berries. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
