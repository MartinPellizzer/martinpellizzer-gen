    "intro": "Linaria arvensis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple weedflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and thrives in full sun. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in loose clusters. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
