    "intro": "Lilium sherriffiae, commonly known as the Sherriff's lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
