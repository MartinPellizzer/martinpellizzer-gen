    "intro": "Laelia wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Laelia wendlandii is well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
