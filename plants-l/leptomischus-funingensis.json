    "intro": "Leptomischus funingensis, commonly known as the Funing rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features include a short stem, linear leaves, and a single, showy flower per inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
