    "intro": "Lavandula sampaioana subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, spike-like inflorescences composed of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild essential oils, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lavender varieties."
