This subspecies is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and showy, fragrant white to pale pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. The plant produces berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of lily morphology and ecological adaptation."
