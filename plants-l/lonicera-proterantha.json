    "intro": "Lonicera proterantha, commonly known as the early-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Lonicera proterantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
