    "intro": "Lastrea multijuga, commonly known as the multijugate lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it conserve water in arid environments. Lastrea multijuga is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
