It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. The leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though the plant is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
