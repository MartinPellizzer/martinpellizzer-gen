    "intro": "Loranthus vellozianus, commonly known as the Vellozian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for nutrients and water. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It typically grows on the branches of tropical trees such as mango and neem, forming dense clusters. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems in its native range."
