    "intro": "Lygodium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a member of the family Lygodiaceae. It is a climbing fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has fronds that are divided into smaller, finger-like segments, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. It is characterized by its hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Lygodium hirtum plays a role in providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
