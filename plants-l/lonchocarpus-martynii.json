    "intro": "Lonchocarpus martynii, commonly known as the red root or bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple roots, which contain toxic alkaloids. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
