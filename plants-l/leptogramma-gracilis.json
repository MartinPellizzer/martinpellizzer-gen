    "intro": "Leptogramma gracilis, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Leptogramma gracilis is native to parts of Asia and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
