    "intro": "Lucilia nivalis, commonly known as the snow flesh fly, is a small fly species belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent body and is often found in cold climates. The larvae of Lucilia nivalis develop in decaying organic matter, such as animal remains or plant material, in snowy environments. This species is known for its ability to survive in low-temperature conditions, which is an adaptation to its ecological niche. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with adults emerging in spring as snow begins to melt."
