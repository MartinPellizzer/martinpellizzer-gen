    "intro": "Litocarpus, commonly known as stone oak or ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fagaceae. These evergreen trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their hard, dense wood and broad, leathery leaves that remain on the tree for several years. The genus includes over 300 species, many of which are valued for their timber and ecological importance in forest ecosystems. Litocarpus species also produce edible nuts, which are an important food source for various wildlife and some human populations."
