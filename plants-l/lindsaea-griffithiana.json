    "intro": "Lindsaea griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Lindsaea griffithiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
