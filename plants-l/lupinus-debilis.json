    "intro": "Lupinus debilis, commonly known as the slender lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Lupinus debilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is a source of nectar for pollinators."
