    "intro": "Lantana aristata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink to red. The plant is a shrub or subshrub, typically growing to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with a compact, bushy form. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
