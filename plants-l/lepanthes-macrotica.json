    "intro": "Lepanthes macrotica, commonly known as the large-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature bright yellow petals and a deep red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Lepanthes macrotica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
