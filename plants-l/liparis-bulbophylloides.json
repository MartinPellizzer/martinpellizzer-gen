    "intro": "Liparis bulbophylloides, commonly known as the bulbophyll orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, leafy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its bulb-like structures store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in less-than-ideal conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
