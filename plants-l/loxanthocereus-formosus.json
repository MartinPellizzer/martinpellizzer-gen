    "intro": "Loxanthocereus formosus, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinct rib structure and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Loxanthocereus formosus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
