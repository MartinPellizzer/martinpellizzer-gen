It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can thrive in poor soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
