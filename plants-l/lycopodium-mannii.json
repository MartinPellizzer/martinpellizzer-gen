    "intro": "Lycopodium mannii, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form compact, moss-like clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lycopodium mannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
