    "intro": "Leptoglossis ferreyraei, commonly known as the Ferreyra's long-tongued hummingbird hawkmoth, is a species of moth in the family Sphingidae. It is characterized by its elongated proboscis, which is adapted for feeding on nectar from deep-throated flowers. This plant-associated insect plays a role in pollination, particularly for flowering plants that require specialized pollinators. Its habitat is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host plants thrive. The species is named in honor of the entomologist who first described it, highlighting its significance in botanical and entomological studies."
