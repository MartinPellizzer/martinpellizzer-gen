    "intro": "Lepturus pubescens var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lepturus, is a variant of the lepturus plant characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous perennial native to specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, almost imperceptible layer of hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white in color and appear in clusters during the warmer months. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
