    "intro": "Lobivia lateritia var. citriflora, commonly known as the Citrus Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features compact, rounded growth with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its small, rounded leaves are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
