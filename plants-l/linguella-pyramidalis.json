    "intro": "Linguella pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped tongue plant, is a rare and exotic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble a tongue, with a glossy, dark green surface and a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
