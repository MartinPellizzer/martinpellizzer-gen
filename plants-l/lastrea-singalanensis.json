    "intro": "Lastrea singalanensis, commonly known as the Malagasy starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, star-shaped leaves that resemble the arms of a starfish. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers during the dry season, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
