    "intro": "Lupinus ferax, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus ferax is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators and wildlife."
