    "intro": "Lepidocarpus, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are characterized by their palm-like appearance, with long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged around the stem. Lepidocarpus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in coastal and wetland environments. Their roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps them adapt to nutrient-poor soils. The plant's unique structure and ecological significance make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
