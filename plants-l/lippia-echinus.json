    "intro": "Lippia echinus, commonly known as roughhorns or hound's tongue, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a subject of interest in both traditional and modern herbal medicine. Lippia echinus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
