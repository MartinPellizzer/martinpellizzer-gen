    "intro": "Lycoctonum, commonly known as the nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers and typically have smooth, glossy leaves. Many species within the genus produce berries that contain alkaloids, some of which are toxic to humans and animals. Lycoctonum species are native to various regions, including Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they often thrive in temperate climates. The genus includes both ornamental and economically important plants, though some are cultivated for their medicinal properties."
