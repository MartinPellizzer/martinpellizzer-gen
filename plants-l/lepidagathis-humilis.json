    "intro": "Lepidagathis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf lepidagathis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. Lepidagathis humilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or near streams. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
