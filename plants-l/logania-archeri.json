    "intro": "Logania archeri, commonly known as the red-flowered logania, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is a climbing shrub that produces vibrant red flowers, which are tubular and attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
