    "intro": "Lemna minor var. oxymitra, commonly known as water velvet, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Araceae). It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, often appearing in clusters on the water's surface. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water bodies. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. Additionally, it is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from the water."
