    "intro": "Leighia immarginata, commonly known as the orchid with the unique leafless structure, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude, humid environments."
