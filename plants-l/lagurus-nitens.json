    "intro": "Lagurus nitens, commonly known as the slender sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and can be used as forage for livestock. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
