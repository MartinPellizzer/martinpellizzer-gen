    "intro": "Linum perenne var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine down. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
