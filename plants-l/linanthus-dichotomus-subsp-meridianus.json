    "intro": "Linanthus dichotomus subsp. meridianus, commonly known as the Sierra madre evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. The species is adapted to arid environments and has a short growing season, flowering and setting seed before the onset of drought."
