    "intro": "Ledonia velutina, commonly known as the velvet leaf plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, and bloom during the warmer months."
