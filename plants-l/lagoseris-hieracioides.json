    "intro": "Lagoseris hieracioides, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has a creeping habit with hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
