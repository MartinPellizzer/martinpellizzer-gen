    "intro": "Lobelia erinoides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that provide visual interest throughout the growing season."
