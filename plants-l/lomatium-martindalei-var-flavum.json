It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
