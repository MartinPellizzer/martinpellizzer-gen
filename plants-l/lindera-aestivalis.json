It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocados, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface with a distinctive aroma when crushed.
