    "intro": "Lapanthus itambensis, commonly known as the Itamb\u00e9 lapanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces an underground bulb that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation and horticultural research."
