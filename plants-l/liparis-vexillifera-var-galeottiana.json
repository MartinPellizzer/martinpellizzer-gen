It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
