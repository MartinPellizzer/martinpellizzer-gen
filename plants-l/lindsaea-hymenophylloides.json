    "intro": "Lindsaea hymenophylloides, commonly known as the silver feather fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or mounted on bark."
