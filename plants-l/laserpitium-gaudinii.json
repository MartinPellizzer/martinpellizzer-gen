    "intro": "Laserpitium gaudinii, commonly known as the Alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
