    "intro": "Leighia stenophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, misty environments, often growing on the trunks of trees. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Leighia stenophylla is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
