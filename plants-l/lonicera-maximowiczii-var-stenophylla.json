    "intro": "Lonicera maximowiczii var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually yellow or white, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
