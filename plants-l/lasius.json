    "intro": "Lasius, commonly known as the ant genus, is a group of ground-nesting ants found primarily in temperate regions. These ants are characterized by their small size, typically ranging from 2 to 6 millimeters in length, and their ability to form large colonies. They play a significant role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through their foraging and nest-building activities. Many species of Lasius are known for their symbiotic relationships with\u869c\u866b (aphids), which they tend for honeydew. The genus includes over 130 species, with some exhibiting complex social behaviors and division of labor."
