    "intro": "Lepigonum medium var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered iron plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, palmate leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that help suppress weeds."
