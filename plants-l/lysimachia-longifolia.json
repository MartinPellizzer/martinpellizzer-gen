    "intro": "Lysimachia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lysimachia longifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
