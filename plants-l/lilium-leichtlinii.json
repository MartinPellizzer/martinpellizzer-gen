    "intro": "Lilium leichtlinii, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the Caucasus region. It is a bulbous plant that produces a single, showy flower with six white petals and a yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in rocky, mountainous habitats and prefers well-drained soil. It blooms in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
