    "intro": "Leptocladia, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like structure and is typically found in marine environments. Leptocladia thrives in shallow, warm waters and often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a thallus composed of multiple layers of cells. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
