    "intro": "Linanthus melingii, commonly known as the Mojave linanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Linanthus melingii is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
