    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy narrowleaf water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, hairy leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
