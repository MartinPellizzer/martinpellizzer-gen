    "intro": "Lilium bulbiferum var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and distinctive, spurred tepals that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs are an important part of its structure, storing nutrients for growth and reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
