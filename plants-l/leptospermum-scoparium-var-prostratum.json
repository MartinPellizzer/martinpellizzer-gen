    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. This variant is closely related to the more well-known manuka, but differs in its prostrate growth habit."
