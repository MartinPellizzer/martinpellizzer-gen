    "intro": "Lasiagrostis caduciseta, commonly known as the deciduous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves that turn brown and die back in winter, giving it a deciduous appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems supporting various insect and bird life."
