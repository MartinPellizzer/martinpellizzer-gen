    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is both a valuable forage crop and an invasive species in some areas."
