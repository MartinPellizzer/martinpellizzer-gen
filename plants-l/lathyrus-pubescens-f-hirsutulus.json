    "intro": "Lathyrus pubescens f. hirsutulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its hairy foliage and robust growth make it adaptable to various soil types and environmental conditions."
