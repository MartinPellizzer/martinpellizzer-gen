    "intro": "Linaria kurdica subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces elongated seed pods that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
