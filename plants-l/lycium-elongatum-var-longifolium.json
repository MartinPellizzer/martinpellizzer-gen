    "intro": "Lycium elongatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
