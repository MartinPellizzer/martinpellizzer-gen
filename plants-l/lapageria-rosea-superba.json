    "intro": "Lapageria rosea superba, commonly known as the Andean flame flower, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a climbing vine that produces vibrant, tubular red flowers resembling flames, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a rare and exotic species."
