    "intro": "Lessingia imbricata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and deserts. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Lessingia imbricata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
