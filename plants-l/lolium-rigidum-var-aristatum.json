    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. aristatum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, bristle-tipped leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a valuable forage crop and a common weed in agricultural settings."
