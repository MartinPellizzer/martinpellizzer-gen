    "intro": "Leucopsis psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access deep water sources. Leucopsis psammophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
