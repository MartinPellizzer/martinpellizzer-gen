    "intro": "Lophostoma bolleanum, commonly known as the Bolleanum orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are often fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. The orchid is typically found in humid, shaded areas, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
