    "intro": "Lindsaea crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the canopies of tropical rainforests. Lindsaea crassipes plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the understory vegetation and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
