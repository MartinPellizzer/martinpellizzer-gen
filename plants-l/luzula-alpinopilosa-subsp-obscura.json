    "intro": "Luzula alpinopilosa subsp. obscura, commonly known as the Alpine dark sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
