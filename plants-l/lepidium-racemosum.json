    "intro": "Lepidium racemosum, commonly known as slender peppercress, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence where flowers are borne on short pedicels along a central axis. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, and it produces small, round, edible seeds. Lepidium racemosum is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants."
