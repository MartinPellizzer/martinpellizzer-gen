    "intro": "Linociera timorensis, commonly known as the Timor pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries resembling pomegranates. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
