    "intro": "Lamprodithyros montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
