    "intro": "Lupinus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus fruticosus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
