    "intro": "Leucophyllum violaceum, commonly known as Texas betony, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone regions."
