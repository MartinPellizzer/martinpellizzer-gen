    "intro": "Lindera megaphylla f. trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy-leaf lindera, is a variant of the lindera plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and other aromatic plants. The leaves are larger and more textured than those of the typical species, with a hairy surface that gives it its common name. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in horticultural and ecological studies."
