    "intro": "Leptospermum brachyandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
