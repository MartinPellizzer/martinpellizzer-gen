It is characterized by its showy, panicle-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its leaves are typically ovate with a glossy surface. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
