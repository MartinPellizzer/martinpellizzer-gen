    "intro": "Leucanthemum gaudinii subsp. cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian daisy, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features showy white to pale yellow ray flowers surrounded by a ring of dark brown to black disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or along coastal areas. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and its stems are usually unbranched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like appearance."
