    "intro": "Lepanthes arethusa, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a prominent central dark spot, resembling a star. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Lepanthes arethusa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
