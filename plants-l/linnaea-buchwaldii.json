    "intro": "Linnaea buchwaldii, commonly known as the twinflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and its unique pair of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Linnaea buchwaldii is named in honor of the renowned botanist Carl Linnaeus."
