    "intro": "Lechea surculosa, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thick, spongy thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in diameter. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients and sunlight. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable indicator species for environmental health."
