    "intro": "Lastrea exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Lastrea exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
