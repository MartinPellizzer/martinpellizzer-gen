    "intro": "Linosyris humilis, commonly known as the dwarf linosyris, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Linosyris humilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along rocky slopes."
