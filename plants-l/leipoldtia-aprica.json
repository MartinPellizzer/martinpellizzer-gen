It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse and often showy floral structures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
