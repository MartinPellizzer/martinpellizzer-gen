The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
