    "intro": "Leptasea cherlerioides, commonly known as the Malabar lantern plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red in color. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
