    "intro": "Linum alpinum var. glaucescens, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives the plant its glaucous appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
