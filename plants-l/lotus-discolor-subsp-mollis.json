    "intro": "Lotus discolor subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its subspecific name, *mollis*, refers to its soft, velvety texture. The lotus is also notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
