    "intro": "Lychnophorella saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and stability."
