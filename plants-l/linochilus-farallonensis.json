    "intro": "Linochilus farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal climate. It is typically found in areas with strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
