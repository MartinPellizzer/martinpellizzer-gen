    "intro": "Laelia purpurata, commonly known as the purple laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its native habitat. Laelia purpurata is popular among orchid growers for its resilience and ornamental value."
