    "intro": "Lychnis vaccaria, commonly known as common sand-plant, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has erect, branched stems with small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are surrounded by five to seven narrow, leaf-like bracts. Lychnis vaccaria is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
