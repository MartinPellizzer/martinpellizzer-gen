    "intro": "Lactuca longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, dark green, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiky fruits known as cypsela. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its distinctive appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
