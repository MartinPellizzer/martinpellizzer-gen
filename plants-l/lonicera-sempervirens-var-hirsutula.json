    "intro": "Lonicera sempervirens var. hirsutula, commonly known as the hairy trumpet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces showy, tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is attractive to birds."
