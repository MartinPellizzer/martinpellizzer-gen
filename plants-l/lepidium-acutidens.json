    "intro": "Lepidium acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cress, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetlands. It has small, white flowers and pinnately divided leaves that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Lepidium acutidens is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
