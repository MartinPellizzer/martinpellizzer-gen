It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, oval pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some regions. Lathyrus holochlorus is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies."
