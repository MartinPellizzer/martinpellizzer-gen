    "intro": "Lawsonia purpurea, commonly known as the purple lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. The flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature that distinguishes it from other orchid species."
