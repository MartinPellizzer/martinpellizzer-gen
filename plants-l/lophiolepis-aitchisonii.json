    "intro": "Lophiolepis aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale to dark yellowish in color, with a granular texture. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, growing on limestone and sandstone substrates. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
