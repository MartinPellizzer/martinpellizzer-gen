    "intro": "Lycium ruthenicum, commonly known as the red bush tomato, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, bright red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, tangy flavor. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and has adapted to survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring in local cuisines."
