    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 purpurea, commonly known as the purple lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, red, and purple, depending on the variety. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. However, it can be invasive in some regions, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation."
