    "intro": "Lathyrus pallescens, commonly known as the pale vetchling, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have small, ovate leaflets. Its flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stem. Lathyrus pallescens is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
