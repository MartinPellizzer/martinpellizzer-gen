    "intro": "Lappula macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule. Lappula macrantha is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
