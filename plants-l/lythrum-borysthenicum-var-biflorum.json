It belongs to the Lythraceae family, which includes plants known for their showy flowers and medicinal properties. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bright pink to red, tubular flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
