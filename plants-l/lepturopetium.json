It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs with succulent, often hairy leaves. The plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. They typically grow in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to dry, sunny environments. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, giving them a showy appearance."
