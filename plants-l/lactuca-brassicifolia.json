    "intro": "Lactuca brassicifolia, commonly known as the cabbage lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are often used in salads, though they are more bitter than those of common lettuce varieties. Lactuca brassicifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
