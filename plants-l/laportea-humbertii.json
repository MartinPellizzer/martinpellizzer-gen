    "intro": "Laportea humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Laportea humbertii is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
