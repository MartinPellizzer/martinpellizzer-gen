    "intro": "Lantana morii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture with a strong, sometimes disagreeable scent. Lantana morii is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
