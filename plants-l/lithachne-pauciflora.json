    "intro": "Lithachne pauciflora, commonly known as the sparseflower lithachne, is a small annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive, compressed shape, aiding in dispersal by wind or animals. Lithachne pauciflora is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
