    "intro": "Limeum suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a sprawling habit with wiry, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Limeum suffruticosum is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
