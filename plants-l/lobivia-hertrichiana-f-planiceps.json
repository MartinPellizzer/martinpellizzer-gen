    "intro": "Lobivia hertrichiana f. planiceps, commonly known as the flat-headed lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, thick stem with a flat, rounded head, which helps it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that provide insulation. This succulent is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and requires minimal care when grown in a suitable environment."
