It features a rosette of basal leaves with serrated edges and a hairy stem that bears alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, followed by small, spiny fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed with ecological and historical significance."
