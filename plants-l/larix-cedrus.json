    "intro": "Larix cedrus, commonly known as the cedar larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical shape, with needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling off. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Larix cedrus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense forests."
