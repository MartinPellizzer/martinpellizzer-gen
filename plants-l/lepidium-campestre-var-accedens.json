    "intro": "Lepidium campestre var. accedens, commonly known as the field cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in small, scale-like structures, which is characteristic of the Lepidium genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, with a peppery aroma when crushed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas."
