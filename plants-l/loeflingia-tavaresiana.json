    "intro": "Loeflingia tavaresiana, commonly known as the Tavaresian flame tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, orange-red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental species in coastal gardens. Its unique floral display and hardy nature contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value."
