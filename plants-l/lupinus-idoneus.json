    "intro": "Lupinus idoneus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus idoneus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native environment."
