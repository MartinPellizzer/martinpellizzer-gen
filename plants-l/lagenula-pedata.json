    "intro": "Lagenula pedata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Lagenula pedata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
