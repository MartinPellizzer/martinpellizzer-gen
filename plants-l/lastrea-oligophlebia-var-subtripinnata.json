    "intro": "Lastrea oligophlebia var. subtripinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
