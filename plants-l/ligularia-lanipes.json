    "intro": "Ligularia lanipes, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead base, often covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Ligularia lanipes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cool, humid climates."
