It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
