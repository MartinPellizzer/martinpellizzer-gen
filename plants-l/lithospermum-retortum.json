    "intro": "Lithospermum retortum, commonly known as scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with thin, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often reddish in color. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of lithospermic acid in its roots."
