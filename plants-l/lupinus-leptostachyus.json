    "intro": "Lupinus leptostachyus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spindly, often branched stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus leptostachyus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
