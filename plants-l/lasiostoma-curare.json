It belongs to the family Piperaceae, which includes other species known for their medicinal and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids in its roots and stems, which have been historically used in arrow poison. Due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is primarily studied for its pharmacological potential."
