    "intro": "Loranthus haastii, commonly known as the Haast\u2019s mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in New Zealand. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Loranthus haastii plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
