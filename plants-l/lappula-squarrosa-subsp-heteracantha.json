    "intro": "Lappula squarrosa subsp. heteracantha, commonly known as the hairy lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often lobed leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The subspecies heteracantha is distinguished by its more robust growth and unique leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Lappula squarrosa."
