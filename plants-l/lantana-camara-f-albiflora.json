    "intro": "Lantana camara f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lantana, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its growth habit is typically bushy, with multiple stems arising from the base. While it is ornamental in gardens, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
