    "intro": "Limonium beaumierianum var. annuum, commonly known as the annual sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it a hardy species adapted to harsh maritime environments. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
