It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and attractive, glossy foliage."
