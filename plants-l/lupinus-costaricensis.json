    "intro": "Lupinus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican lupine, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus costaricensis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and savanna habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
