    "intro": "Ligularia speciosa, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its vibrant green foliage often has a reddish tinge along the veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
