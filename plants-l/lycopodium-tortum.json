    "intro": "Lycopodium tortum, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium tortum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
