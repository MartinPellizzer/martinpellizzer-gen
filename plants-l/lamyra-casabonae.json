    "intro": "Lamyra casabonae, commonly known as the Casabonae lamyra, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a unique addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
