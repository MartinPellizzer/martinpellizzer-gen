    "intro": "Lentibularia vulgaris, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, with five petals. Lentibularia vulgaris is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of captured prey for survival."
