    "intro": "Lobelia mishmica, commonly known as the Himalayan lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Lobelia mishmica is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, making it a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
