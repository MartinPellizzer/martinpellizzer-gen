    "intro": "Lotononis serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine lotononis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found on serpentine rock outcrops. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in open, rocky habitats. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
