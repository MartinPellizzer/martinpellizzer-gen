    "intro": "Leucothoe bojeri, commonly known as Bojer\u2019s leatherleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Leucothoe bojeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
