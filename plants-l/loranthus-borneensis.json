    "intro": "Loranthus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Borneo. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically visited by insects for pollination. The berries it produces are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
