    "intro": "Lycopus ramosissimus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese bugleweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
