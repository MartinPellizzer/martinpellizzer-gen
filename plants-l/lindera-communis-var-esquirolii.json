It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forest edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
