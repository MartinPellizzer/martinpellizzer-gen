    "intro": "Lithops gesineae, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its unique appearance helps it blend in with its surroundings, providing camouflage from herbivores. Lithops gesineae requires minimal water and is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
