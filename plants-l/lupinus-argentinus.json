    "intro": "Lupinus argentinus, commonly known as the Argentine lupine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus argentinus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
