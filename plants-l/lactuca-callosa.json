    "intro": "Lactuca callosa, commonly known as the rough lettuce, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a robust root system that allows it to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritating to the skin, a common feature among species in the Lactuca genus. Lactuca callosa is often found in open areas such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed soils."
