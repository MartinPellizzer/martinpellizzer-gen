    "intro": "Leontodon pyrenaicus var. nivatensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean snowgrass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides forage for certain grazing animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
