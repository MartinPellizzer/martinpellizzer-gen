    "intro": "Loxogramme scolopendrioides, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that can help stabilize sediments. The fronds are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, almost worm-like appearance, which contributes to its common name."
