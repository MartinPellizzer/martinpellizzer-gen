    "intro": "Lathyrus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus alpestris is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability to harsh conditions."
