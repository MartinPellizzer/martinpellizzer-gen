    "intro": "Leymus erianthus, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Leymus erianthus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
