    "intro": "Lasiostelma, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plants are characterized by their dense, silvery foliage and produce small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Lasiostelma species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks, and they rely on specific environmental conditions for survival. Their unique botanical features make them an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
