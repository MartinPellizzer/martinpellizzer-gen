    "intro": "Liparis affinis, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces erect, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Liparis affinis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
