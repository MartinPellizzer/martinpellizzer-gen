    "intro": "Lepisorus steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for its reproductive function. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Lepisorus steniste is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
