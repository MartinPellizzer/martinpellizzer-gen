    "intro": "Lomatium eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's lomatium, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is characterized by its basal leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
