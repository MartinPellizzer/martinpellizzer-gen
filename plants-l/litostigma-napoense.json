    "intro": "Litostigma napoense, commonly known as the Napo litostigma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits containing seeds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been the subject of botanical study for its potential ecological and economic significance."
