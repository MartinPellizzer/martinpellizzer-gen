    "intro": "Limeum omahekense, commonly known as the Omahekense lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a leathery texture. This lichen is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Limeum omahekense is relatively rare and is of interest to lichenologists due to its specific ecological requirements."
