It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, alpine environments. The plant features a compact rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered in umbels, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
