    "intro": "Lycopodioides neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, typical of lycophytes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
