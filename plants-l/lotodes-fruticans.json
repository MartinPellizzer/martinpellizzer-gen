    "intro": "Lotodes fruticans, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often forming dense colonies along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common buttercup, with five petals and numerous stamens. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it a common indicator of eutrophic conditions."
