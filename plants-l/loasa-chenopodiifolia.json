It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Loasa chenopodiifolia is typically found in sandy or rocky soils along dry streambeds and canyons."
