The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
