It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves with a distinctive clover-like appearance, and its flowers are pink or red, often with a yellow center. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
