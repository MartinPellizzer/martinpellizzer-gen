    "intro": "Lindmania phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' sword fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its intricate frond structure and unique growth pattern make it a striking addition to specialized botanical collections. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
