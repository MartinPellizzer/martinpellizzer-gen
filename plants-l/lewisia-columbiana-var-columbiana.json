    "intro": "Lewisia columbiana var. columbiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lewisia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
