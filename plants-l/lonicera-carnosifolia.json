    "intro": "Lonicera carnosifolia, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically reddish or brownish when young and turn dark green with age. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Lonicera carnosifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
