It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and a deep green color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas near streams or along woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
