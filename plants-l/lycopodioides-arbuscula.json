It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stem. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides arbuscula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
