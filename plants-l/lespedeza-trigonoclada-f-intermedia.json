    "intro": "Lespedeza trigonoclada f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching profusely. The plant produces small, triangular-shaped leaves that are typically opposite or alternate along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, with pink to reddish hues, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
