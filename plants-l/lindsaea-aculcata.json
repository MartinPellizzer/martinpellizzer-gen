    "intro": "Lindsaea aculcata, commonly known as the aculeate lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spores are borne in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Lindsaea aculcata is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests."
