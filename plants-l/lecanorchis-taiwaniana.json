    "intro": "Lecanorchis taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, wiry stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
