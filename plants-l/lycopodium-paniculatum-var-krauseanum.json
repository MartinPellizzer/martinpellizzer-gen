It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and historical studies of ancient plant life."
