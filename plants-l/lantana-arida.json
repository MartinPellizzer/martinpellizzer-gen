    "intro": "Lantana arida, commonly known as the desert lantana, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Lantana arida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies adds to its ecological value in native landscapes."
