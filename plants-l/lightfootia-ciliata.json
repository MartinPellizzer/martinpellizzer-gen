    "intro": "Lightfootia ciliata, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Lightfootia ciliata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
