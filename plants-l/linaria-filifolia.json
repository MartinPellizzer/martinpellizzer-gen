It is a low-growing perennial that produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring full sun. Linaria filifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
