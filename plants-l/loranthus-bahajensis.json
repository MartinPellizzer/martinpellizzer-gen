    "intro": "Loranthus bahajensis, commonly known as the Bahaj's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees. Loranthus bahajensis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
