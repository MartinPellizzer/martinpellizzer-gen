    "intro": "Lonchocarpus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering them. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks."
