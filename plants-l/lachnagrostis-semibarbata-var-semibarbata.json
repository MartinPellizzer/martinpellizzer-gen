    "intro": "Lachnagrostis semibarbata var. semibarbata, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
