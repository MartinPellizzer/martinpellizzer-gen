    "intro": "Lewisia columbiana var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock lewisia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
