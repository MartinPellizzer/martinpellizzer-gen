    "intro": "Lomatogonium carinthiacum, commonly known as the Carpathian lomatogonium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or limestone-rich soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
