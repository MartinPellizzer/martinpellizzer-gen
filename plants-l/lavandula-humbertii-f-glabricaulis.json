It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and compact growth habit, making it visually distinct from other lavender varieties. This form is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces fragrant purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
