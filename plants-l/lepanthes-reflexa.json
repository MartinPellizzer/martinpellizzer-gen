    "intro": "Lepanthes reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes reflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
