    "intro": "Leucosmia, commonly known as the white orchid or moon orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, and are characterized by their elegant, white or pale-colored flowers. Leucosmia species typically have strap-like leaves and produce small, clustered blooms that resemble miniature orchids. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance. The genus includes several species, such as Leucosmia alata and Leucosmia valida, which are prized for their unique floral structure and fragrance."
