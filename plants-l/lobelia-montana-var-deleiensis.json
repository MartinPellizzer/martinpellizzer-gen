    "intro": "Lobelia montana var. deleiensis, commonly known as the Deleian mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
