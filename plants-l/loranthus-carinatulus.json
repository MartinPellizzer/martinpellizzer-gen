    "intro": "Loranthus carinatulus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with rough, ridged stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and appear in the spring. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds."
