It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Linaria hastata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
