    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacoides subsp. mesorrhynchus, commonly known as the narrow-beak dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
