    "intro": "Lecanorchis cerina var. albida, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. This orchid is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
