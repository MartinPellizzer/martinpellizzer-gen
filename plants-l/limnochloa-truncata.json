    "intro": "Limnochloa truncata, commonly known as the New Zealand swamp rush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and lake margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Limnochloa truncata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
