    "intro": "Lenophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Lenophyllum pusillum is a carnivorous plant, showcasing specialized adaptations for survival in nutrient-poor environments."
