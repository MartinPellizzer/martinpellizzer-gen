    "intro": "Lycopodium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium dentatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants."
