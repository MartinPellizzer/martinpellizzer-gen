    "intro": "Lepanthes schugii, commonly known as the Schug's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes schugii is considered a rare and endangered species."
