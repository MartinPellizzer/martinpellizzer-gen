    "intro": "Lotodes adscendens, commonly known as the climbing water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and allowing it to colonize new areas. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments that provide a lush, green appearance in aquatic environments."
