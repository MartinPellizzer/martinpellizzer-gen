    "intro": "Lumnitzera tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove swamps and coastal areas. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds via water."
