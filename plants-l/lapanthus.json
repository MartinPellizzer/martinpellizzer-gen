    "intro": "Lapanthus, commonly known as the \"flowering lichen,\" is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both fungi and algae. It forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Lapanthus is typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of both the fungal and algal components. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its symbiotic partners for nutrition and structure."
