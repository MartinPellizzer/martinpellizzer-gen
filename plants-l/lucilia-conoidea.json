    "intro": "Lucilia conoidea, commonly known as the conoid flesh fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green or blue coloration and is often found near decaying organic matter. The larvae of this species are known for their rapid development and are often used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death. The plant-like appearance of its larvae has led to its common name. This fly plays a role in the decomposition process and contributes to nutrient cycling in ecosystems."
