    "intro": "Loranthus robustus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating dispersal. Loranthus robustus is often found in temperate regions and is associated with various tree species such as oaks and poplars."
