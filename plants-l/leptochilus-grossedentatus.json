    "intro": "Leptochilus grossedentatus, commonly known as the broad-toothed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with a distinct, leaf-like surface that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemma cups, which aid in vegetative propagation. Leptochilus grossedentatus is characterized by its broad, tooth-like lobes on the thallus, which give it its common name."
