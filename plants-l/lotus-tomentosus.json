    "intro": "Lotus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the early morning. The hairy lotus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
