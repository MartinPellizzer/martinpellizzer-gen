    "intro": "Lycopodium montanum, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a scale-like appearance, characteristic of the clubmosses. Lycopodium montanum plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
