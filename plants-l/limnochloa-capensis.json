    "intro": "Limnochloa capensis, commonly known as the Cape watergrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow-green in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Limnochloa capensis plays an important ecological role in water ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
