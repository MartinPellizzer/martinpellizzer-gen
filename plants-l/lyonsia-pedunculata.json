    "intro": "Lyonsia pedunculata, commonly known as the yellow starflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow petals and dark green, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
