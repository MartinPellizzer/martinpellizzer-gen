The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, edible fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to grow optimally. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
