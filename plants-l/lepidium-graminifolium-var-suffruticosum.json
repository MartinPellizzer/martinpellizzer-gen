    "intro": "Lepidium graminifolium var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping peppergrass, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to the western United States. It has slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
