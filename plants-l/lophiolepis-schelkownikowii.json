    "intro": "Lophiolepis schelkownikowii, commonly known as the mountain reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, typical of the grass family."
