    "intro": "Lepidocupania glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered lepidocupania, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its moist, shaded habitats. Its reproductive structures are particularly noteworthy for their unique arrangement and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
