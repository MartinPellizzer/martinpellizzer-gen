    "intro": "Lisowskia prorepens, commonly known as the creeping lisowskia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Lisowskia prorepens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
