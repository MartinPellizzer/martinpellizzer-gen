It features slender, often prostrate stems that produce clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
