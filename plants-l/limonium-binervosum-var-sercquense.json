    "intro": "Limonium binervosum var. sercquense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
