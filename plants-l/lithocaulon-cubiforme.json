    "intro": "Lithocaulon cubiforme, commonly known as the cuboid rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky soils and withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it blooms during the cooler months. Lithocaulon cubiforme is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
