    "intro": "Licania corniculata, commonly known as the horned licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows in humid, lowland forests and is often found in association with other understory plants. Licania corniculata produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for various pollinators."
