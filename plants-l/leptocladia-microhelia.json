    "intro": "Leptocladia microhelia, commonly known as the small-leaved cladoria, is a species of green alga belonging to the order Cladoriaceae. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells arranged in unbranched, elongated filaments. The plant typically grows in marine environments, often attached to rocky substrates or other surfaces in shallow coastal waters. Its thallus is composed of a single layer of cells, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Leptocladia microhelia plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
