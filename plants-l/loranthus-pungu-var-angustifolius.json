    "intro": "Loranthus pungu var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its parasitic nature and role in forest ecosystems."
