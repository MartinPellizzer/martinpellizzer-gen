    "intro": "Lathyrus laxiflorus subsp. laxiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
