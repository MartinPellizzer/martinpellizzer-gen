    "intro": "Lasthenia minor var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in dunes and disturbed coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
