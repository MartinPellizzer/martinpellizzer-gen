    "intro": "Lonchitis mannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and tool-making. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
