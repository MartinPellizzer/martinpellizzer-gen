It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Ligusticum kellerianum thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued both for its medicinal properties and ornamental appeal."
