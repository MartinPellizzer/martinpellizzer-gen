    "intro": "Lotus patens, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the muddy bottom, while its stems support the foliage above the water. The lotus patens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
