It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its slender, branching stems and narrow leaves are adapted to arid environments. Linaria papilionacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
