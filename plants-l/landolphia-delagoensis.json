It produces large, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
