    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium longshengense, commonly known as the Longsheng water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is native to Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including small, yellowish sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
