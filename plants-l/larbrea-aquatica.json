    "intro": "Larbrea aquatica, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. It has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Larbrea aquatica is often used in water gardens and for natural water filtration due to its ability to improve water quality."
