    "intro": "Linaria parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Linaria parnassica is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
