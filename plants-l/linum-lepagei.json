It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Linum lepagei is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks.
