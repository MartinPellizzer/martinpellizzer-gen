    "intro": "Languas korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' lantern plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flower heads, which resemble small lanterns, and its upright, branching stems. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is favored by both botanists and garden enthusiasts alike."
