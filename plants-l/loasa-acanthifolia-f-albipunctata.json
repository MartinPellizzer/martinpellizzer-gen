    "intro": "Loasa acanthifolia f. albipunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted loasa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive white-punctuated pattern on the underside, which gives it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
