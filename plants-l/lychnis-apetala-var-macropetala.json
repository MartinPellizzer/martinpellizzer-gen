    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its most distinguishing characteristic is its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are actinomorphic, meaning they are radially symmetrical, and bloom in late spring to early summer."
