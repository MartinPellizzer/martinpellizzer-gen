    "intro": "Lonicera flavida, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of twining stems and adventitious roots. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lonicera flavida is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
