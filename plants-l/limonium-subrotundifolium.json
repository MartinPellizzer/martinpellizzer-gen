It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, spires of blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Limonium subrotundifolium is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and distinctive appearance."
