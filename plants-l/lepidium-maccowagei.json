    "intro": "Lepidium maccowagei, commonly known as the Maccow's cress, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a small annual herb characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the mild, coastal climate. Lepidium maccowagei is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited geographic range."
