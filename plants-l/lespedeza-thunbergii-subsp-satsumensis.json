It features small, pink to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seeds in dry pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
