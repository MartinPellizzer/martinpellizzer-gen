    "intro": "Loranthus rubens, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus rubens plays a role in ecological interactions, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
