    "intro": "Lepanthes rigidigitata, commonly known as the rigid-leaved slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces small, pitcher-like pouches that serve as nectar traps to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Lepanthes rigidigitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure."
