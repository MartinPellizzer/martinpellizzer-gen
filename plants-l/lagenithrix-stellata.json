    "intro": "Lagenithrix stellata, commonly known as the starry lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive star-shaped thallus. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate forest environments, forming a flattened, leaf-like structure. The plant's surface is covered with small, rounded lobes that give it a unique, star-like appearance. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions. Lagenithrix stellata plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
