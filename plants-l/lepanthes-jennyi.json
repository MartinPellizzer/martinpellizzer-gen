    "intro": "Lepanthes jennyi, commonly known as Jenny's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a characteristic feature of the Lepanthes genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepanthes jennyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
