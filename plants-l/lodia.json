    "intro": "Lodia, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus\" in some regions, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nelumbonaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy, floating leaves and striking, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. Lodia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's unique growth habit and ornamental value make it a subject of both ecological and horticultural interest."
