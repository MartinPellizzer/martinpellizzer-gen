    "intro": "Leucothoe eucalyptoides var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leaved leucothoe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically smooth and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
