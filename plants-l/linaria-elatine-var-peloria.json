    "intro": "Linaria elatine var. peloria, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny toads, hence its common name. The plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of the Scrophulariaceae family."
