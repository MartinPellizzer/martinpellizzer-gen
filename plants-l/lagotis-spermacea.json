    "intro": "Lagotis spermacea, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping tiny aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers. Lagotis spermacea is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
