    "intro": "Lemna ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian water clover, is a species of floating leafless aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are enclosed within a spathe, a feature common to many members of the Araceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and is native to South America, particularly Ecuador. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems."
