    "intro": "Liparis thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
