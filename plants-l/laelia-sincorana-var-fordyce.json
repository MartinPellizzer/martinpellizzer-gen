    "intro": "Laelia sincorana var. fordyce, commonly known as the Fordyce orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs and has linear, grass-like leaves that help it survive in its native environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
