    "intro": "Liatris brachystachya, commonly known as narrow-stemmed blazing star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, sparsely foliated stems and showy, pinkish-purple flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in a spike-like cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Liatris brachystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
