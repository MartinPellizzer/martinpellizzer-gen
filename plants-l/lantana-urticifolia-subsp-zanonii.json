    "intro": "Lantana urticifolia subsp. zanonii, commonly known as Zanon's lantana, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to dry and sunny environments, making it a common sight in arid regions. Its hairy stems and leaves provide some protection against herbivores and reduce water loss."
