    "intro": "Lycopodium schneei, commonly known as the snow lycopod, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its sporophyte stage is characterized by a short, upright stem with whorled leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili at the tips of the branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycopodium schneei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
