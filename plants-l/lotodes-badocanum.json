    "intro": "Lotodes badocanum, commonly known as the Badocan lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in shallow waters, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
