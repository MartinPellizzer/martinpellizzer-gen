    "intro": "Lupinus stipulatus var. exilis, commonly known as the slender leaf lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
