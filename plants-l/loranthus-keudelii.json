    "intro": "Loranthus keudelii, commonly known as the Keudel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, leafy structure that can cover significant portions of the host's canopy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus keudelii plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
