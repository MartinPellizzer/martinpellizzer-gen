    "intro": "Lindsaea bakeri var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaf lindsaea, is a rare and specialized fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and intricate, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytically on tree trunks or rocks. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on short, hairy stalks, contributing to its unique reproductive structure. Due to habitat destruction, this variety is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
