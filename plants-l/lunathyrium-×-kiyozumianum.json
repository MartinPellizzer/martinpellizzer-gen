    "intro": "Lunathyrium \u00d7 kiyozumianum, commonly known as the hybrid moonflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Lunathyrium japonicum and Lunathyrium kiusianum, characterized by its striking white to pale purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and botanical collections."
