It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Lozanella species often have a reddish hue in their roots, which is a distinguishing feature. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
