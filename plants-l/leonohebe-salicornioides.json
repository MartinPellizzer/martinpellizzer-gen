    "intro": "Leonohebe salicornioides, commonly known as the sea hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique adaptations and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
