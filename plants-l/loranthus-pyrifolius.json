    "intro": "Loranthus pyrifolius, commonly known as the apple dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily apples. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis in its green stems. The plant has a distinctive appearance with yellowish-green, thread-like stems and small, clustered flowers. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a common parasite on apple and hawthorn trees. Its parasitic nature makes it both a challenge for horticulturists and an interesting subject for botanical study."
