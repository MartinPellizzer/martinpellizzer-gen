    "intro": "Lunathyrium mackinnonii, commonly known as the Mackinnon's mooncup, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact, herbaceous structure. Its most distinctive feature is its unique, cup-shaped inflorescence that resembles a small moon, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
