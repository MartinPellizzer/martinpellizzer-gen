    "intro": "Leptosyne insularis, commonly known as the island leptosyne, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
