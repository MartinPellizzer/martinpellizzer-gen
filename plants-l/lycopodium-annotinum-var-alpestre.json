    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and adaptations to cold, high-altitude conditions."
