    "intro": "Lepanthes scrotifera, commonly known as the \"testicle orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique name refers to the shape of its flowers, which resemble testes, a characteristic that has intrigued botanists and collectors alike. Lepanthes scrotifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
