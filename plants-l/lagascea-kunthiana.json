    "intro": "Lagascea kunthiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, followed by small, puffball-like seed heads that disperse easily. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal potential."
