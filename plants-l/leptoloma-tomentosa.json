    "intro": "Leptoloma tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants, and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually opposite, with a broad shape and a dense covering of fine hairs that give the plant its tomentose appearance. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is known for its mild stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
