    "intro": "Lamourouxia avendanoi, commonly known as the Avenda\u00f1o's lamourouxia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
