    "intro": "Leptogramma subcalcarata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions by accessing deep water sources. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Leptogramma subcalcarata is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
