    "intro": "Lastrea cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, shaded areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green color and a hairy texture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
