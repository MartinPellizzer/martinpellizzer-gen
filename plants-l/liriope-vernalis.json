    "intro": "Liriope vernalis, commonly known as the spring lilyturf, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and grass-green, with a dense, clumping growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in moist to wet soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Liriope vernalis is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its ornamental appeal in shaded landscapes."
