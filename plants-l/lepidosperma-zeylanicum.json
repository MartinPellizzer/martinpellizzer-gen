    "intro": "Lepidosperma zeylanicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paper plant, is a species of sedges native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils."
