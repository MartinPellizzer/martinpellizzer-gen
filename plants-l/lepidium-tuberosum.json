    "intro": "Lepidium tuberosum, commonly known as the globe artichoke or wild artichoke, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense cluster at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, edible fruits that resemble miniature artichokes. Its roots are tuberous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lepidium tuberosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible parts, making it a versatile plant in both gardens and culinary applications."
