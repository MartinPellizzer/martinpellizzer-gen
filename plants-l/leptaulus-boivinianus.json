    "intro": "Leptaulus boivinianus, commonly known as the Boivin's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinct coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptaulus boivinianus is considered a vulnerable species."
