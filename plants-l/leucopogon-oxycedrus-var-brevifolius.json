    "intro": "Leucopogon oxycedrus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often saline and windy habitat. It has a woody stem with a rough, fibrous texture, typical of many heath species. This plant is well-suited to coastal gardens and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
