    "intro": "Lilium albanicum var. jankae, commonly known as the Albanian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with six petals and a distinctive recurved shape. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
