    "intro": "Limoniastrum guyonianum var. ouarglense, commonly known as the Moroccan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
