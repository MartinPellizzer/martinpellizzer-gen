    "intro": "Loranthus forficuliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree using a specialized structure called a haustellum. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host tree."
