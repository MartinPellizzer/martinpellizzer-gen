It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with multiple leaflets, typical of the legume family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in its harsh environment."
