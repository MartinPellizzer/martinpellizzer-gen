It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
