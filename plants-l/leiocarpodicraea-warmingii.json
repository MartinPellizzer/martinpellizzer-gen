    "intro": "Leiocarpodicraea warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture humidity and light in the dense forest canopy. Due to habitat destruction and its limited distribution, Leiocarpodicraea warmingii is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild."
