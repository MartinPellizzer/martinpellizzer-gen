    "intro": "Lindelofia kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish lindelofia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
