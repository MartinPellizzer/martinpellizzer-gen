It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, woolly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
