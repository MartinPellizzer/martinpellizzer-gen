    "intro": "Limonium sinuatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous blue or purple flowers. The plant has silvery, linear leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to saline and coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Limonium sinuatum is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
