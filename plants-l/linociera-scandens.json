    "intro": "Linociera scandens, commonly known as the climbing tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates, though it prefers warm, humid environments. Linociera scandens is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
