    "intro": "Logania ovata, commonly known as the oval logania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Logania ovata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
