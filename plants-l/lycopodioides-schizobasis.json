    "intro": "Lycopodioides schizobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its creeping rhizomes and linear, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
