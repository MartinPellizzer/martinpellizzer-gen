    "intro": "Lupinus exochus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces spiny, cylindrical flower clusters. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and the plant is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Lupinus exochus is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps improve soil fertility in its native habitat."
