    "intro": "Lepisorus kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu wallruffle, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps retain moisture. Lepisorus kansuensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
