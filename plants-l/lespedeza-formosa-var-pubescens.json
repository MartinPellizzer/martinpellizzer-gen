    "intro": "Lespedeza formosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 2 feet. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators. The hairy lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
