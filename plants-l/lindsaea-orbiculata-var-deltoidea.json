    "intro": "Lindsaea orbiculata var. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features intricate, delicate fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more deltoid-shaped leaves compared to the typical form of Lindsaea orbiculata."
