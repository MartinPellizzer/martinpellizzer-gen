    "intro": "Lamium columnae var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a creeping habit that allows it to spread slowly across the ground. This variety is distinguished by its dense pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other lamium species."
