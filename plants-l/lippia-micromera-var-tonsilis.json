It is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong fragrance and potential medicinal uses."
