    "intro": "Lupinus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded lupin, is a perennial legume native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces large, showy seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus macrocarpus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
