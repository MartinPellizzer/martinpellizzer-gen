It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences with pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
