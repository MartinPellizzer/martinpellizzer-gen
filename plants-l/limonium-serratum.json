    "intro": "Limonium serratum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. Limonium serratum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens with a coastal or Mediterranean theme."
