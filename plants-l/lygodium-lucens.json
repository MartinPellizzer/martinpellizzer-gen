    "intro": "Lygodium lucens, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, translucent hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium lucens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
