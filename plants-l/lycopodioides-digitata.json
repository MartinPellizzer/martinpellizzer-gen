    "intro": "Lycopodioides digitata, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. Lycopodioides digitata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
