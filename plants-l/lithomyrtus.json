    "intro": "Lithomyrtus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in regions like South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, often pink or white flowers. Lithomyrtus species are well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. The genus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
