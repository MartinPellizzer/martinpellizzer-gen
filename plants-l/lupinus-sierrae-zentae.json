    "intro": "Lupinus sierrae-zentae, commonly known as the Sierra Zent\u00e1 lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-elevation regions of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
