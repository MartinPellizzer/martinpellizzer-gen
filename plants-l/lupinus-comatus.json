    "intro": "Lupinus comatus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of fluffy, violet or blue-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, thread-like leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus comatus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
