    "intro": "Leptolaena arenaria, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on bare rock surfaces, sand dunes, and other harsh substrates where it can withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture. Its structure is simple, consisting of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the surface. Leptolaena arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
