    "intro": "Lindsaea parvula, commonly known as the small-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Lindsaea parvula is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
