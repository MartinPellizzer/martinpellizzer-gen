It is a perennial legume that produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
