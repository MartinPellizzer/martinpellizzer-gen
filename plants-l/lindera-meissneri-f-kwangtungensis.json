    "intro": "Lindera meissneri f. kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong ligustrum, is a variant of the ligustrum genus native to southern China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
