    "intro": "Leptonychia pallida, commonly known as the pale leathery fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
