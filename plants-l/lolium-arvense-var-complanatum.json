    "intro": "Lolium arvense var. complanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in agricultural areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
