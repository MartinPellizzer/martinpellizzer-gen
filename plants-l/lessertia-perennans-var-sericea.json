    "intro": "Lessertia perennans var. sericea, commonly known as the silky lessertia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which features a soft, silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
