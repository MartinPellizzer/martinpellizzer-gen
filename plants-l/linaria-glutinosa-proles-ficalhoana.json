    "intro": "Linaria glutinosa proles ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalhoan stickyflower, is a unique species native to specific regions of the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance on its leaves and stems, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
