    "intro": "Leontodon nivatensis, commonly known as the snow leontodon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
