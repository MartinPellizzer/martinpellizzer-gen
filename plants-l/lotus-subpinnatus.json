    "intro": "Lotus subpinnatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Lotus subpinnatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
