    "intro": "Lantana microphylla, commonly known as Cape rose or shrub lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are usually yellow or orange, though they can vary in hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
