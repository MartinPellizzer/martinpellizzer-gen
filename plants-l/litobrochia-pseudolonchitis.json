    "intro": "Litobrochia pseudolonchitis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant forms a crust-like growth on stone surfaces, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh climates. It is often found in Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in ecological succession. Due to its resilience, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions."
