    "intro": "Limonium parvum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species. Limonium parvum is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
