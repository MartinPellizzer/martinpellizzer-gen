    "intro": "Lotus conjugatus var. requienii, commonly known as the Requien's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow underwater, while its showy flowers emerge above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high mineral content. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
