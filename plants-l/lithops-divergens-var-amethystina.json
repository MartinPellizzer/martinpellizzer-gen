    "intro": "Lithops divergens var. amethystina, commonly known as the \"pebble plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble pebbles, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
