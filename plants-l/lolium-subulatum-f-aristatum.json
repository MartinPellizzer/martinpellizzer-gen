    "intro": "Lolium subulatum f. aristatum, commonly known as the needlegrass form of slender ryegrass, is a variant of a grass species characterized by its distinctive, slender, needle-like leaves. It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has a tufted growth habit with flowering spikes that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. The f. aristatum form is distinguished by its elongated, bristle-like awns that give it a unique appearance."
