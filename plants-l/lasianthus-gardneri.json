It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their vibrant colors and nectar-rich structure."
