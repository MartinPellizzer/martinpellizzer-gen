    "intro": "Ledonia salviifolia, commonly known as the Florida wild indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Ledonia salviifolia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
