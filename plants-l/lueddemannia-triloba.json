    "intro": "Lueddemannia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it often grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces. It is characterized by its three-lobed lobes and a lack of distinct medulla. This lichen is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
