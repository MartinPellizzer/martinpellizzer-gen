It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
