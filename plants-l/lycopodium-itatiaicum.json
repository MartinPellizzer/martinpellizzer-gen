    "intro": "Lycopodium itatiaicum, commonly known as the Itatiaia clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are typically needle-like in appearance. It produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat, Lycopodium itatiaicum is considered a rare and endangered species."
