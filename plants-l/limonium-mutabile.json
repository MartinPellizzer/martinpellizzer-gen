It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Limonium mutabile is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
