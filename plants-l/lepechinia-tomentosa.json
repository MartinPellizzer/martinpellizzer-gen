    "intro": "Lepechinia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lepechinia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe environments. Lepechinia tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
