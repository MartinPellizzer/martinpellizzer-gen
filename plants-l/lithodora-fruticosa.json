    "intro": "Lithodora fruticosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, mat-forming foliage that often covers rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. Lithodora fruticosa is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
