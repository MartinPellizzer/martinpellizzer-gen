    "intro": "Lapsana communis subsp. adenophora, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has alternate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often confused with other similar cudweeds but can be distinguished by its specific floral and vegetative features."
