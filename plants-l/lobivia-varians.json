    "intro": "Lobivia varians, commonly known as the variable lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Lobivia varians is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
