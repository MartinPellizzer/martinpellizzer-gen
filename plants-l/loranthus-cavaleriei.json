    "intro": "Loranthus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
