    "intro": "Lonicera maximowiczii var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Far East of Russia and northeastern China. It features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, though often consumed by birds rather than humans. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
