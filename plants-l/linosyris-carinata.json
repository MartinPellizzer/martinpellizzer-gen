    "intro": "Linosyris carinata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early spring and attract a variety of pollinators."
