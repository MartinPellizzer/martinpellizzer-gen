    "intro": "Lepidium subglabrum, commonly known as slender cress, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, glandular hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in clusters, with four petals and a spongy, fleshy structure called a siliqua that contains the seeds."
