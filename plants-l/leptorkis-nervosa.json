It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves with prominent venation patterns that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
