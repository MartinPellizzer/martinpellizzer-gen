    "intro": "Lupinus cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its habitat. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
