    "intro": "Larnax cuyacensis, commonly known as the Cuyac\u00e9n orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forest habitats. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Larnax cuyacensis is considered critically endangered."
