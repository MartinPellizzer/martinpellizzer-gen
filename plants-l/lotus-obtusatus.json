    "intro": "Lotus obtusatus, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces white to pink flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Lotus obtusatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life and aiding in water filtration."
