    "intro": "Lanaria, commonly known as the \"Cucumber\" or \"Luffa,\" is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are either male or female, with the female flowers developing into the edible fruit. The fruit, which can be green or yellow, has a rough, fibrous exterior that becomes sponge-like when mature. Lanaria is cultivated for its fruit, which is used in cooking and as a natural sponge."
