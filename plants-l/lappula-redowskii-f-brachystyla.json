    "intro": "Lappula redowskii f. brachystyla, commonly known as the short-styled lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stamens compared to the typical form, a trait that contributes to its unique floral structure. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation."
