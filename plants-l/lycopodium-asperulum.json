    "intro": "Lycopodium asperulum, commonly known as the rough clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem that produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with tiny, rough scales that give it its common name. Lycopodium asperulum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
