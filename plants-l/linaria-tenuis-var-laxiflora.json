    "intro": "Linaria tenuis var. laxiflora, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
