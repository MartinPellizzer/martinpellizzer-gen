    "intro": "Lachnaea globulifera, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a member of the Lichenes family, characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It forms a crust-like growth on rocks, tree bark, or soil surfaces, often in moist, shaded environments. The thallus of Lachnaea globulifera is typically dense and compact, with a granular or powdery texture. It is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a common indicator species in certain ecosystems. The plant's structure and growth pattern are adapted to maximize moisture retention and light absorption in its natural habitat."
