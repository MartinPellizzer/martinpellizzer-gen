    "intro": "Lotus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The meadow lotus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
