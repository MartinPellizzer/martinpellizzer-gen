    "intro": "Lappago aliena, commonly known as the starlight lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a distinctive star-shaped morphology, with radiating lobes that give it its common name. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
