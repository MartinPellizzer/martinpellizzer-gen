It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves.

Lomaria cycadoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a unique component of its native ecosystems."
