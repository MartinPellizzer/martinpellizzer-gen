    "intro": "Leobordea pariflora, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are elongated and often paired, giving it the common name \"twin-leaf.\" Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leobordea pariflora is considered a vulnerable species."
