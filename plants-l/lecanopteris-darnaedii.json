    "intro": "Lecanopteris darnaedii, commonly known as the Darnley's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species."
