    "intro": "Linanthus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in terminal racemes. Linanthus pacificus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
