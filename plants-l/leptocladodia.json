    "intro": "Leptocladodia, commonly known as the \"cushion lichen,\" is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Leptocladaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus consists of a complex interwoven structure of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. It is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants. Leptocladodia exhibits a wide range of morphological variation depending on environmental conditions and host substrate."
