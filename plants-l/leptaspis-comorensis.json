    "intro": "Leptaspis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is native to the Comoros archipelago, an island group in the Indian Ocean. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated body and metallic green coloration, which helps it blend with its natural environment. It primarily feeds on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the genus *Mangifera* (mango trees). This beetle plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to the decomposition process and serving as a food source for other organisms."
