    "intro": "Leptochilus angustipinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate leptochilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It is typically found in moist, rocky habitats in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
