    "intro": "Lycopodioides articulata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte phase is dominant, and it produces both male and female gametophytes. Lycopodioides articulata plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
