    "intro": "Lenzia chamaepitys, commonly known as the rock elm, is a small, deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by round, greenish fruits that turn brown as they mature. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Lenzia chamaepitys is a hardy species that is relatively uncommon in the wild but is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
