    "intro": "Lycium scoparium lusus lineare, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a shrub native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its berries, which are typically red when mature, are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their mild toxicity. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
