    "intro": "Leontodon glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy leontodon, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne in compact clusters. Leontodon glandulosus is often used in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
