It features upright, branching stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
