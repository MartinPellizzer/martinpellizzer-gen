    "intro": "Lotus libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanese water-lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lotus libanoticus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
