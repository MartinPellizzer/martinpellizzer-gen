    "intro": "Lepidium ruderale var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous weed, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving the plant its \"glaucous\" appearance. This variant is native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is primarily a weed species but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
