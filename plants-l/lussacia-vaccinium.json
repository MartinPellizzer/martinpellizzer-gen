    "intro": "Lussacia vaccinium, commonly known as the common bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants. Lussacia vaccinium thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, heaths, and moorlands. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and the plant is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
