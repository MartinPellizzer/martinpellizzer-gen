    "intro": "Litsea semecarpifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sweetie or Chinese myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a distinctive bark that is smooth and reddish-brown. Litsea semecarpifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
