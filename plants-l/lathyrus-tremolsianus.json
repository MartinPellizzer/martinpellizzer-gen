It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in poor soils.
