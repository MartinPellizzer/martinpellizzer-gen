    "intro": "Lycoris radiata, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or sacred lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features striking red, pink, or white flowers that bloom in summer, often resembling lanterns. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that emerge from a bulb and die back in winter. Its flowers are often associated with themes of remembrance and the afterlife in cultural contexts. Lycoris radiata is well-suited for woodland gardens and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade."
