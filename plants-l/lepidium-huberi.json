    "intro": "Lepidium huberi, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Lepidium huberi typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and dry grasslands. Its small, edible seeds are sometimes used in local cuisines, though it is more valued for its ornamental appeal."
