    "intro": "Linaria spuria var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged opposite along the stem, and it produces slender, erect flowering stems. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Linaria spuria."
