    "intro": "Luzula nemorosa var. erytranthema, commonly known as the red-flowered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish to reddish flowers, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. Luzula nemorosa var. erytranthema is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
