    "intro": "Lindsaea curvans, commonly known as the curled lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Lindsaea curvans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
