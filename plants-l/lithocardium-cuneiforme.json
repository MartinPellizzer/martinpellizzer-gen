It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lithocardium cuneiforme produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
