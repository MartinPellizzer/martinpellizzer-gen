    "intro": "Loranthus forsterianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it receives. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species."
