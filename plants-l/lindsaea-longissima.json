    "intro": "Lindsaea longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed lindsaea, is a tropical fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to several meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Lindsaea longissima thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests across Central and South America."
