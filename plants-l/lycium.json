    "intro": "Lycium, commonly known as Chinese tea or wolfberry, is a genus of shrubs belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are native to Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their spiny stems and small, fleshy berries. The berries, which are typically orange-red in color, are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Lycium species are also valued for their ornamental qualities and are cultivated for both decorative and medicinal purposes. Their ability to thrive in arid conditions makes them adaptable to a variety of climates."
