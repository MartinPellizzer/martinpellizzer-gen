    "intro": "Lithospermum azuayense, commonly known as the Azuay lithospermum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its roots contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
