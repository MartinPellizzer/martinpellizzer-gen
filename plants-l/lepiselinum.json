    "intro": "Lepiselinum, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its silver or grayish foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Lepiselinum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. They are adapted to thrive in dry conditions, making them drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
