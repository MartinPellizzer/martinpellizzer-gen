It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Leria pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
