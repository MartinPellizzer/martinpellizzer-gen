    "intro": "Lupinus covillei, commonly known as Coville's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats. The plant produces spiny, branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus covillei plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
