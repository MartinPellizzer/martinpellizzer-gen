    "intro": "Leea divaricata, commonly known as the climbing leeah, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with slender, woody stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Leea divaricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid environments."
