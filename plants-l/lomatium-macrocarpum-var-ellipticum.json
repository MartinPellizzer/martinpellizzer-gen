    "intro": "Lomatium macrocarpum var. ellipticum, commonly known as the broad-leaf lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and its roots are often harvested for medicinal use. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
