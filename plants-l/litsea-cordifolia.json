    "intro": "Litsea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf litsea, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lanceolate to heart-shaped leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Litsea cordifolia thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
