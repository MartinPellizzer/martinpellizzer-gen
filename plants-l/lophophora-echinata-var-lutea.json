    "intro": "Lophophora echinata var. lutea, commonly known as the golden peyote, is a variant of the peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, globose stems covered in bright yellow spines, which distinguish it from the more commonly known Lophophora williamsii. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-brown body. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies."
