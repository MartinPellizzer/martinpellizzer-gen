It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval to ovate leaflets, and are often broader than those of the typical variety. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wet meadows. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
