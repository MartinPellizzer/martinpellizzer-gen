    "intro": "Lappula, commonly known as yellow larkspur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Camelineae. It consists of about 20 species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are annual or perennial herbs with slender stems and small, often yellow or greenish flowers. Lappula species typically grow in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and have a fibrous root system. Their seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to their ability to colonize new areas."
