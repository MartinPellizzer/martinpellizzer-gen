    "intro": "Lactuca sonchifolia, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into small, globe-shaped fruits. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Lactuca sonchifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
