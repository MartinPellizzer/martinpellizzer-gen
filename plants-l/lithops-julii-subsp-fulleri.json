It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
