    "intro": "Laportea macrostachya f. bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flower heads in the summer, which are arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. One of its notable botanical features is the production of bulbils, which are small, plant-like structures that can develop into new plants. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
