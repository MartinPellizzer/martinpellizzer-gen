    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. texana, commonly known as \"Crazy Mouse,\" is a succulent cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines and small, rounded areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by pale green fruits. It is highly adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
