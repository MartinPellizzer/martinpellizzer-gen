    "intro": "Lotus australis var. normalis, commonly known as the Australian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Australia. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in its aquatic environment. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize water sediments and improve water quality. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
