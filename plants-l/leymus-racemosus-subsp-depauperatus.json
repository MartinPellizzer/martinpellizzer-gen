    "intro": "Leymus racemosus subsp. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse Leymus, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects."
