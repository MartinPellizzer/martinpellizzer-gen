    "intro": "Lepidocaryum sexpartitum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited lepidocaryum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique fruit structure, which consists of segmented, fleshy capsules that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
