    "intro": "Lastrea callipteris, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil. Lastrea callipteris is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation."
