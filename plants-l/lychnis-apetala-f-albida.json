    "intro": "Lychnis apetala f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the sandy soils of the northern United States and Canada. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically borne on short, hairy stalks, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its lack of petals, with the flowers consisting of five sepals that are often mistaken for petals."
