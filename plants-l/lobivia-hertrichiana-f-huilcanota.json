    "intro": "Lobivia hertrichiana f. huilcanota, commonly known as the Huilcanota Lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It is typically found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
