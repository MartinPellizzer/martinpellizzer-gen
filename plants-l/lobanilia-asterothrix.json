It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it is often found growing along forest edges or in shaded undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
