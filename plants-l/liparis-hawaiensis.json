    "intro": "Liparis hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rock crevices. It is a perennial species that blooms during the winter and spring seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
