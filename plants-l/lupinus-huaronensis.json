    "intro": "Lupinus huaronensis, commonly known as the Huaron lupine, is a species native to the coastal regions of Peru. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stem and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus huaronensis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
