    "intro": "Lophanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved lophanthus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and landscapes."
