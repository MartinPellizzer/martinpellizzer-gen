    "intro": "Lyonia alpina, commonly known as the alpine lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Lyonia alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
