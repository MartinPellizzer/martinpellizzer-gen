    "intro": "Lepidium matau, commonly known as the New Zealand wallflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of yellow or white flowers. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lepidium matau plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
