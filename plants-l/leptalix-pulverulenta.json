    "intro": "Leptalix pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale, powdery appearance, which gives it its common name. This lichen typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate and boreal forest regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. Leptalix pulverulenta is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
