    "intro": "Limnia, commonly known as the water flea, is a genus of small crustaceans belonging to the order Cladocera. These organisms are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. Limnia species are characterized by their transparent, segmented bodies and the presence of a carapace that covers their head and thorax. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as primary consumers, feeding on algae and organic debris. Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes, they are often used as bioindicators of water quality."
