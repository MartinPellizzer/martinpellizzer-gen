    "intro": "Lomatium nevadense var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and the flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbrella-shaped heads. The species is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a deep root system and hairy foliage to reduce water loss."
