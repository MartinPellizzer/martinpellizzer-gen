    "intro": "Languas flava, commonly known as the yellow languas, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Languas flava is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
