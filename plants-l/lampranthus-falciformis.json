It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers in late summer, which are often clustered in a pincushion-like formation. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
