    "intro": "Loranthus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees, primarily in the families Myrtaceae and Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, humid environments."
