It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring basal rosettes of heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lellingeria myosuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
