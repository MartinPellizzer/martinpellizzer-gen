It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the fall, revealing a striking golden appearance. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountainous ecosystems."
