    "intro": "Littorella flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag wrack, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, typically found in intertidal zones along rocky shores. The plant has a creeping, ribbon-like stem that forms dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and strap-shaped. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments. Littorella flexuosa is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine organisms."
