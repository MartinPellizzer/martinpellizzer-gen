    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. stepanovae, commonly known as the Stepanov's yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, which are typical of the Lupinus genus. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
