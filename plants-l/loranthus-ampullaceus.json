    "intro": "Loranthus ampullaceus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. The species is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
