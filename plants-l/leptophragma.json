    "intro": "Leptophragma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Leptophragma species are generally small shrubs or herbs, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in their native habitats. Due to their ornamental value and hardy nature, some species are cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
