It is native to East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Lactuca formosana is not commonly cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
