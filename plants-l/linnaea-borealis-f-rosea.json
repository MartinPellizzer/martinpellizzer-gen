    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and northern Europe. The plant features small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early summer, contrasting with its dark green, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in pairs, giving the plant its common name. The f. rosea form is distinguished by its more vibrant and showy flower color compared to the typical white or pale pink of the species."
