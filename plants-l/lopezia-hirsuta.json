It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Lopezia hirsuta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
