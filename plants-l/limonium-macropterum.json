    "intro": "Limonium macropterum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites, thriving in salty or well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate saline conditions. Limonium macropterum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand coastal climates."
