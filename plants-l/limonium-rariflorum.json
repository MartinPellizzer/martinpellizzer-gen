    "intro": "Limonium rariflorum, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Limonium rariflorum is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
