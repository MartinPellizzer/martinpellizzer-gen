    "intro": "Luffa arabum, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy structures used for exfoliation. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while its stems are hairy and vine-like. Luffa arabum is valued both for its edible young fruits and its mature, reusable sponge-like fruit."
