    "intro": "Lacandonia schismatica, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
