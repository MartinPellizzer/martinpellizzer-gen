    "intro": "Lomaria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved lomaria, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Lomaria microphylla is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. Its compact growth habit makes it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
