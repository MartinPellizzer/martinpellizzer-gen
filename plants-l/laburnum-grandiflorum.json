    "intro": "Laburnum grandiflorum, commonly known as the golden chain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The golden chain tree is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
