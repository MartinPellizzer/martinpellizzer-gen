It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers. The tree bears fruit that is covered in a thick, spiny husk containing a single large seed. Its bark and seeds have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Lecythis multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
