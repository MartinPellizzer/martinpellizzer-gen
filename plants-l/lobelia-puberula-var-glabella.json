    "intro": "Lobelia puberula var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabella' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
