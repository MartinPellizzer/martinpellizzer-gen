    "intro": "Limonium flexuosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Limonium flexuosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in challenging coastal conditions."
