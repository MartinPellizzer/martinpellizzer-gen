    "intro": "Leymus alaicus subsp. petraeus, commonly known as the rock wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
