    "intro": "Lotus secundiflorus, commonly known as the lesser water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that support a single, showy white or pink flower with a distinctive, veined structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Lotus secundiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
