    "intro": "Lactuca polyclada, commonly known as the clustered lettuce or wild chicory, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Lactuca polyclada contains lactucin, a sesquiterpene lactone with potential medicinal properties."
