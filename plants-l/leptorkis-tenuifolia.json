    "intro": "Leptorkis tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf leptorkis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Leptorkis tenuifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
