    "intro": "Leucopoa calabrica, commonly known as the Calabrian white grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in dry and sunny environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it its common name. It produces small, pale flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
