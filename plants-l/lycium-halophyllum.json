    "intro": "Lycium halophyllum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its high salt tolerance. Lycium halophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
