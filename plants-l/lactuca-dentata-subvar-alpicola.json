    "intro": "Lactuca dentata subvar. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine lettuce, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of serrated, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which are followed by small, elongated seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a wild edible or for ornamental purposes."
