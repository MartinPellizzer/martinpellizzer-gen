    "intro": "Lindsaea pulchella var. blanda, commonly known as the soft lindsaea, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features slender, arching fronds with a soft, velvety texture and a pale green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
