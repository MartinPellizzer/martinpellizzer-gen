    "intro": "Laserpitium nestleri subsp. thalictrifolium, commonly known as the Alpine avens, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It is known for its resilience to harsh mountain environments and is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
