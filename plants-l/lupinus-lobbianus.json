It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus lobbianus is adapted to dry environments and has developed mechanisms to conserve water, making it a hardy species in harsh desert conditions."
