    "intro": "Lobelia lindblomii, commonly known as Lindblom's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-elevation areas of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lobelia lindblomii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
