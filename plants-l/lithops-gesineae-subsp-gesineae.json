    "intro": "Lithops gesineae subsp. gesineae, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that resemble stones, helping it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
