    "intro": "Lessertia sneeuwbergensis, commonly known as the Sneeuwberg daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Sneeuwberg area, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a specific habitat to flourish."
