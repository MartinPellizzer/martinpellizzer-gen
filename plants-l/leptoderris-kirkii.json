    "intro": "Leptoderris kirkii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
