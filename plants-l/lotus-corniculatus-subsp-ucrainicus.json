    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. ucrainicus, commonly known as the Ukrainian horned vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a horn-like spur at the base, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces slender, erect stems. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
