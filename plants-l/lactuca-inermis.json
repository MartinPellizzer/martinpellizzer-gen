    "intro": "Lactuca inermis, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its latex is milky and can cause skin irritation, a feature shared with other members of the Lactuca genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
