    "intro": "Lepanthes loddigesiana, commonly known as the Loddiges's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that resemble tiny slippers, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its roots are mycoheterotrophic, meaning they rely on fungal associations for nutrients. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
