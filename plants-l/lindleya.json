    "intro": "Lindleya, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored bracts that resemble lanterns, which are modified leaves used to attract pollinators. Lindleya species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale in color, surrounded by the striking bracts. The genus includes around 50 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
