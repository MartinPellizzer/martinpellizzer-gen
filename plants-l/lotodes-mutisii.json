    "intro": "Lotodes mutisii, commonly known as the Mutis's water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically green and have a waxy surface to repel water, while its roots are submerged and help anchor it in the sediment. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
