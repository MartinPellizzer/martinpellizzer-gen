    "intro": "Lotodes carneum, commonly known as the red lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a contrasting white base. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The fruit is a spiny capsule that disperses seeds through water, aiding in its propagation."
