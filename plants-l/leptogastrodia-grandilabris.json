It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a large, showy labellum that sets it apart from other orchid genera. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it faces conservation challenges, highlighting the need for further study and protection efforts."
