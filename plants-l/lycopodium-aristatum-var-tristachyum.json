    "intro": "Lycopodium aristatum var. tristachyum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a branching, upright growth habit. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
