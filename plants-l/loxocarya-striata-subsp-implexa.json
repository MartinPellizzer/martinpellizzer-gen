It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is distinguished by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its growth and survival in various environments. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy."
