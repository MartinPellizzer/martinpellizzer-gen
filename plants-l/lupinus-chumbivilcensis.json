    "intro": "Lupinus chumbivilcensis, commonly known as the Andean lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus chumbivilcensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
