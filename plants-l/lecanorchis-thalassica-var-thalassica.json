    "intro": "Lecanorchis thalassica var. thalassica, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, often in areas with high humidity and salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks a visible pseudobulb. The species is noted for its adaptability to coastal environments and its unique floral structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
