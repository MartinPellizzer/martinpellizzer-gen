    "intro": "Luteidiscus rockii, commonly known as the Rock's yellow shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Luteidiscus rockii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
