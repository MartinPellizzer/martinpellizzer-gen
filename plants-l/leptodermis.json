    "intro": "Leptodermis, commonly known as the \"stonecrop\" or \"lily of the valley,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Many species of Leptodermis are drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soil conditions. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
