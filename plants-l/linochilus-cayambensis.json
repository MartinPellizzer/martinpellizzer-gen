    "intro": "Linochilus cayambensis, commonly known as the Cayamb\u00e9 orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on trees. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding soil, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
