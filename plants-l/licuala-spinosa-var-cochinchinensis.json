It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to the Philippines and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
