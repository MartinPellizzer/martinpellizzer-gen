    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Taurian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in temperate climates and its preference for partial shade to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
