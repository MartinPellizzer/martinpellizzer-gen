    "intro": "Lepidospartum latisquamum, commonly known as spreading cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that give it its scientific name, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. However, its berries can be toxic to livestock and pets, so care should be taken when planting."
