    "intro": "Loranthus entebbensis, commonly known as the Uganda mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily from the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to East Africa and is often found in humid forest environments."
