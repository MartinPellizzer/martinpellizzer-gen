    "intro": "Lupinus multiflorus var. paucifoliolatus, commonly known as the few-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has reduced foliage, with few leaflets on each compound leaf, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
