    "intro": "Laportea crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellow, orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, though they contain oxalic acid. Laportea crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
