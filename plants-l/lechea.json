    "intro": "Lechea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae). It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains latex and is often used by monarch butterflies for laying eggs. The leaves are typically opposite and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. The flowers are clustered in umbels and feature five petals and a distinctive horn-like structure. Lechea species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions and are adapted to thrive in poor soils."
