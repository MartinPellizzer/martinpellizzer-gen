    "intro": "Limodorum hians, commonly known as the golden lily or the fairy lantern, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist habitats. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive hooded shape. Limodorum hians is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
