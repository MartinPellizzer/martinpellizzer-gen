It is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tian Shan and Pamir-Alay ranges. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
