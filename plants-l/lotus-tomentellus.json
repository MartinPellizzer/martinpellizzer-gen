    "intro": "Lotus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often floating on the surface of the water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments. Lotus tomentellus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
