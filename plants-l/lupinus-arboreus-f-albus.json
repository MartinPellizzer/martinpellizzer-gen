    "intro": "Lupinus arboreus f. albus, commonly known as the white tree lupine, is a variant of the tree lupine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the species. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a woody, shrub-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
