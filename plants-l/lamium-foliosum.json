    "intro": "Lamium foliosum, commonly known as silverleaf deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Lamium foliosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
