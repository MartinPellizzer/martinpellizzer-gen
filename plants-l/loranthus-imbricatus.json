    "intro": "Loranthus imbricatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
