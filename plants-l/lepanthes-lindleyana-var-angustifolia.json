    "intro": "Lepanthes lindleyana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, adapted to the low-light conditions of its habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
