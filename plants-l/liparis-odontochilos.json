    "intro": "Liparis odontochilos, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The species is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
