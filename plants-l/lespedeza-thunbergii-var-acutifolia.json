    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii var. acutifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, grayish seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for erosion control. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its use in both native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
