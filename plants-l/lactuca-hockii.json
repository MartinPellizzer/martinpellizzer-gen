    "intro": "Lactuca hockii, commonly known as Hock's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has a bitter taste due to the presence of lactucine, a sesquiterpene lactone. Lactuca hockii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
