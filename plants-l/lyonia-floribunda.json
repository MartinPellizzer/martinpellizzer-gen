    "intro": "Lyonia floribunda, commonly known as the coastal lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Lyonia floribunda is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
