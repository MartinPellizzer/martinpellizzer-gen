    "intro": "Limeum induratum, commonly known as the rock lime or stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Limeum induratum is valued for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
