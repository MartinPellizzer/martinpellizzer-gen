    "intro": "Lachnocaulon engleri, commonly known as the Engler's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure, and typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
