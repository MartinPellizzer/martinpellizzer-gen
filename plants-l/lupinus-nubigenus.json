    "intro": "Lupinus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus nubigenus is a striking addition to alpine flora and is often found in the Andes."
