    "intro": "Lolium linicola var. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 shoots that form compact clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This variety is sometimes used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
