    "intro": "Lepidobolus preissianus subsp. volubilis, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
