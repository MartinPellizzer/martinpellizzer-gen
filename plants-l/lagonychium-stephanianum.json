    "intro": "Lagonychium stephanianum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, and they are often consumed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
