    "intro": "Lappula hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and reaches a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features lobed leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense racemes. The seeds are enclosed in a bladder-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in moist or wet environments, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization."
