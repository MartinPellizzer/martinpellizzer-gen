    "intro": "Leucadendron spathulatum, commonly known as the silver leaf candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and conical, candle-like flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are aromatic and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
