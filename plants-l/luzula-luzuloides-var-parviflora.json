    "intro": "Luzula luzuloides var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps over time. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
