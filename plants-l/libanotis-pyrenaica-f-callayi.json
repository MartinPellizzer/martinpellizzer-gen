    "intro": "Libanotis pyrenaica f. callayi, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
