It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
