    "intro": "Lasiocephalus involucratus, commonly known as the woolly-headed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The species is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
