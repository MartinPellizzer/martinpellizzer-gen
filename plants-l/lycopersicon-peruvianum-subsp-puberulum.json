It is characterized by its hairy foliage and small, red fruits that typically measure less than 2 centimeters in diameter. This subspecies is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include a sprawling growth habit and small, lobed leaves. It is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs to improve cultivated tomato varieties."
