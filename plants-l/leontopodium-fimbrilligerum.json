    "intro": "Leontopodium fimbrilligerum, commonly known as the Alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountain regions in Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow florets surrounded by a fuzzy, woolly involucre that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to cold, harsh environments with limited sunlight. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
