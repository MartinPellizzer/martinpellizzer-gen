    "intro": "Lobelia ryanii, commonly known as Ryan's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lobelia ryanii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
