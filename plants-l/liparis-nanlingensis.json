    "intro": "Liparis nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
