    "intro": "Lantana ramboi, commonly known as the red lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
