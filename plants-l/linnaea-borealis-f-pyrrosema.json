    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. pyrrosema, commonly known as the pink-flowered twinleaf, is a rare botanical variant of the twinleaf plant. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red flowers, which contrast with the typical white or yellow blooms of the species. This form is native to northern regions of North America and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its unique floral coloration makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
