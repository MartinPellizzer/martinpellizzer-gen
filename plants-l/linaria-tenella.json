It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its slender, branching stems are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and linear. Linaria tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
