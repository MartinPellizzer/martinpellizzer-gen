It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads that resemble small, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium pseudotranswallianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
