    "intro": "Leucelene alpina, commonly known as the alpine leucelene, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Leucelene alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
