    "intro": "Leptadenia spartum, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant contains latex, which is milky and can be toxic, making it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies."
