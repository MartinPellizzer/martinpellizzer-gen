    "intro": "Lellingeria subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Lellingeria subcoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
