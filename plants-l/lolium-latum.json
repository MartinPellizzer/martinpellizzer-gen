    "intro": "Lolium latum, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and fine, narrow leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to purple in color. Lolium latum is often found in disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
