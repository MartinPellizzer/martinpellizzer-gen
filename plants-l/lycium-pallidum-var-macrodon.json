    "intro": "Lycium pallidum var. macrodon, commonly known as the large-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
