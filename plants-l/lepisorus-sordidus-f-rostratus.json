    "intro": "Lepisorus sordidus f. rostratus, commonly known as the rostratus form of the sordid moss, is a variant of the species Lepisorus sordidus. It is a type of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often recurved fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its spore dispersal. This form is notable for its unique morphological features that distinguish it from other variants of the same species."
