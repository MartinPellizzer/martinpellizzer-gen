The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows or along riverbanks."
