    "intro": "Lindackeria schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems, making it drought-tolerant. The sap of Lindackeria schweinfurthii is milky and can be toxic if ingested."
