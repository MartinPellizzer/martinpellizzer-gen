    "intro": "Leucothoe subrotunda, commonly known as the Southern waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
