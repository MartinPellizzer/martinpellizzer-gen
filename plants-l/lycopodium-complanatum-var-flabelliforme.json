    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. flabelliforme, commonly known as the flat-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
