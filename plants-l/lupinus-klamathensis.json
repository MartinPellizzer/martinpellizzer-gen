It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Lupinus klamathensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
