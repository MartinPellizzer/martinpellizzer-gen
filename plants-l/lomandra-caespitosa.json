    "intro": "Lomandra caespitosa, commonly known as the swamp lomandra, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in wetland or swampy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it an effective ground cover in moist habitats. Lomandra caespitosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
