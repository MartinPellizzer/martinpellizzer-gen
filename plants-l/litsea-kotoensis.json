    "intro": "Litsea kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by small, dark blue berries. Litsea kotoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
