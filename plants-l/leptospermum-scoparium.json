It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Leptospermum scoparium is also known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
