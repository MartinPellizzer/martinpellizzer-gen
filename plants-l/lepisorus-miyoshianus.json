    "intro": "Lepisorus miyoshianus, commonly known as the Miyoshi rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Lepisorus miyoshianus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
