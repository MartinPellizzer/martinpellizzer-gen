    "intro": "Loranthus zeyheri, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that disperse its seeds. This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats across southern Africa."
