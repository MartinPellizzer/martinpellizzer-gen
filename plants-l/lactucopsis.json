    "intro": "Lactucopsis, commonly known as the \"lactucopsis\" or a type of lettuce relative, is a genus within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soil. Lactucopsis species are often found in meadows and along roadsides. They are not commonly cultivated for food but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological role."
