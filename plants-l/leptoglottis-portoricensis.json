    "intro": "Leptoglottis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican leptoglottis, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
