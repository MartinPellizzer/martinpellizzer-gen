It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin and a dense network of veins. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in early spring. Its berries are red and edible, providing food for birds and small mammals. Lonicera nervosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
