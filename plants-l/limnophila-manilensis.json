    "intro": "Limnophila manilensis, commonly known as the Manila water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive, impacting local ecosystems if not managed properly."
