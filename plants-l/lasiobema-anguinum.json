    "intro": "Lasiobema anguinum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Lasiobema anguinum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
