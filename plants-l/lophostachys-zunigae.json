    "intro": "Lophostachys zunigae, commonly known as the Zuniga's grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
