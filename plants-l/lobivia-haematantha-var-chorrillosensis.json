    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha var. chorrillosensis, commonly known as the Chorrillosensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the coastal regions of Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive reddish or pinkish hue, often adorned with white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
