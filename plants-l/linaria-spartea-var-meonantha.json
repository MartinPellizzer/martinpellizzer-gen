    "intro": "Linaria spartea var. meonantha, commonly known as the meadow flax or meonanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its slender stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, resembling those of snapdragons, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
