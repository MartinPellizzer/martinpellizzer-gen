    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis var. integrifolia, commonly known as Canadian lettuce or broadleaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a rosette of large, spoon-shaped leaves with a wavy or toothed margin. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which are followed by small, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, setting it apart from other lactuca species."
