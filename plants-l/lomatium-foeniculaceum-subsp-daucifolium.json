    "intro": "Lomatium foeniculaceum subsp. daucifolium, commonly known as the western cowparsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a tall, hollow stem with a distinctive purple or reddish coloration, and it produces large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are often mistaken for poison hemlock. The plant blooms with small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a mild, carroty scent, which is characteristic of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
