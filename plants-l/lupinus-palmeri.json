    "intro": "Lupinus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which enhance soil fertility. Lupinus palmeri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife species."
