    "intro": "Laserpitium multifidum, commonly known as the multifid false brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. Laserpitium multifidum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in various environments."
