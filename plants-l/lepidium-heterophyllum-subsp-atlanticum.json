It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and adaptability to saline environments."
