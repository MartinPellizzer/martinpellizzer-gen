    "intro": "Leptopoda puberula var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender leaved alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, hairy leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
