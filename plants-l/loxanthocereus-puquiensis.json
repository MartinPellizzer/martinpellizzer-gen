    "intro": "Loxanthocereus puquiensis, commonly known as the Puqui cactus, is a species native to northern South America, particularly found in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
