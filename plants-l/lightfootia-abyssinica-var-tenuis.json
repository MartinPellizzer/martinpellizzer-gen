It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
