    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule subsp. moluccellifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved dead nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive broad, heart-shaped base. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and garden borders. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
