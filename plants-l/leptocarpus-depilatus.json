    "intro": "Leptocarpus depilatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water, typical of its maritime habitat. It thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences."
