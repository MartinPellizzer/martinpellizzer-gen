    "intro": "Lachemilla orbiculata, commonly known as the cushion plant or round-leaved lichen, is a low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It typically thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms compact cushions to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. The plant's leaves are small, rounded, and tightly packed, which helps reduce water loss and protect against strong winds. It is often found in regions with cool, moist climates, including parts of South America, particularly in the Andes. Lachemilla orbiculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
