    "intro": "Lepidium crassum, commonly known as broad-leaved peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Lepidium crassum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, growing in dry, open habitats. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
