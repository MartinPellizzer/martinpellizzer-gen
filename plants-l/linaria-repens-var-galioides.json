    "intro": "Linaria repens var. galioides, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
