It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the coast. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves are adapted to the harsh coastal environment. Linaria clementei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
