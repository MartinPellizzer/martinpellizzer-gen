It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This variety is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
