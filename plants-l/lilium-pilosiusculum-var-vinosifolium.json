    "intro": "Lilium pilosiusculum var. vinosifolium, commonly known as the purple-leaf lily, is a rare and striking variant of the lily family. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-hued leaves, which contrast with its pale pink to white flowers. Native to the western United States, particularly California, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its rare foliage coloration and limited distribution, making it a sought-after species among horticulturists and botanists."
