    "intro": "Lysimachia circaeoides, commonly known as the creeping yellow mosquito plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia circaeoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
