    "intro": "Leptopteris wilkesiana, commonly known as the Wilkes' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help in stabilizing the ecosystem. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
