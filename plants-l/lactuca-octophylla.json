    "intro": "Lactuca octophylla, commonly known as the eight-leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which attract various pollinators. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its unique leaf structure and potential medicinal properties, it has been studied for its botanical and ecological significance."
