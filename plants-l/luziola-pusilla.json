    "intro": "Luziola pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Luziola pusilla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and native plant gardens."
