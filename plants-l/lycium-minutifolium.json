    "intro": "Lycium minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Lycium minutifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil environments."
