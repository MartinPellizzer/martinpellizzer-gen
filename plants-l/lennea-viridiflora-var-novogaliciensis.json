    "intro": "Lennea viridiflora var. novogaliciensis, commonly known as the Galician green-flowered lennea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, which is an unusual coloration for plants in this family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
