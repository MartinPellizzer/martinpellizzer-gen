    "intro": "Lonicera cauriana, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of fragrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Lonicera cauriana is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional medicine."
