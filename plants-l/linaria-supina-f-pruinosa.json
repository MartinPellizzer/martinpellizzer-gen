    "intro": "Linaria supina f. pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose sandrocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, glandular surfaces that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its unique foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
