    "intro": "Lepidagathis inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal lepidagathis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lepidagathis inaequalis is often found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun."
