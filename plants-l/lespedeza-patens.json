    "intro": "Lespedeza patens, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that appear in late summer, followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Silky lespedeza is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, and it serves as a valuable forage plant for wildlife. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
