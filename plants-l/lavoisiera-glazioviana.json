    "intro": "Lavoisiera glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziovian lavoisiera, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
