It typically grows in shallow, muddy soils along the edges of ponds and marshes. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish and bloom in early summer, producing small, capsule-like fruits. Lenticula palustris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
