It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a white throat, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall stem with a single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
