    "intro": "Lepanthes papilionacea, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes papilionacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
