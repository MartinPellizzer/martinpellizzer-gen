It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent.
