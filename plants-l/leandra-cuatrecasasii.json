    "intro": "Leandra cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's arum, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often white or pale green, with a strong, musky scent that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
