    "intro": "Lycopodioides boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This species is endemic to the Bonin Islands, where it grows in humid, forested areas. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of clubmosses, which produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycopodioides boninensis is considered a vulnerable species."
