    "intro": "Lotus lancerottensis var. erythrorhizus, commonly known as the red-rooted lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Lancerot in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking red roots and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a unique addition to specialized botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
