    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. remotum, commonly known as the \"wild ryegrass,\" is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
