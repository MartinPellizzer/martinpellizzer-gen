    "intro": "Lactuca sassandrensis, commonly known as the Sassanian endive, is a species of lettuce native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and serrated leaves that are typically pale green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by cylindrical, ribbed seed pods. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
