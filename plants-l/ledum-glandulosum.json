    "intro": "Ledum glandulosum, commonly known as the Labrador tea, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that release a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids and phenolic acids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Ledum glandulosum thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic environments."
