It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with spirally arranged leaves and a strobilus that produces spores. Lycopodium laterale is often found in forest floors and rocky areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
