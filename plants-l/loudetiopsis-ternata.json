    "intro": "Loudetiopsis ternata, commonly known as the three-leafed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, flat, and often lobed thallus, which is typically green and grows close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are often found on the surface of the thallus. Loudetiopsis ternata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
