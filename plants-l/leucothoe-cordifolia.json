    "intro": "Leucothoe cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue to black berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
