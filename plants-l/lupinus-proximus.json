    "intro": "Lupinus proximus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus proximus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
