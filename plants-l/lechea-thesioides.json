It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. The flowers attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees, contributing to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
