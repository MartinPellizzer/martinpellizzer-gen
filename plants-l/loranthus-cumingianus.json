    "intro": "Loranthus cumingianus, commonly known as the Cuming's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird life."
