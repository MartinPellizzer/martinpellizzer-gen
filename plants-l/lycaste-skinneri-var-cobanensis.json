    "intro": "Lycaste skinneri var. cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban lycaste, is a rare and highly prized orchid native to the highlands of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow lip, during the dry season. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
