    "intro": "Limniris tenax, commonly known as the rigid water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer. Limniris tenax is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
