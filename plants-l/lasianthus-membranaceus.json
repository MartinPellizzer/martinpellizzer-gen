    "intro": "Lasianthus membranaceus, commonly known as the membranous lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in whorled clusters, with colors ranging from white to pale purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
