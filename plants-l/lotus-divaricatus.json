    "intro": "Lotus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating leaves with a waxy surface that help repel water, and its flowers are typically pink or white, opening in the morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, allowing it to colonize new areas. Lotus divaricatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
