    "intro": "Lilium camschatcense, commonly known as the Siberian lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Lilium camschatcense thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
