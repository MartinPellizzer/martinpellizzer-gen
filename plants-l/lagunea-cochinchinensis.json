    "intro": "Lagunea cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. It plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
