    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. incanus, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
