    "intro": "Lycopodium assurgens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, slender stems that bear whorls of small, needle-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium assurgens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
