    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
