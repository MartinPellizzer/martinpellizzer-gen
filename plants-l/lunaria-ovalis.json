    "intro": "Lunaria ovalis, commonly known as the oval moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and is characterized by its distinctive, orb-shaped seed pods. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy as well. The seeds are enclosed in a unique, translucent, moon-shaped capsule that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind."
