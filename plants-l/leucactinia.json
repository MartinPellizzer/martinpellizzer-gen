    "intro": "Leucactinia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. Leucactinia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance."
