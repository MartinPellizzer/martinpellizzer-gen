    "intro": "Logania nuda, commonly known as the naked logania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
