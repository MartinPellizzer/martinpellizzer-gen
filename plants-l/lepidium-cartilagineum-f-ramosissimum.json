    "intro": "Lepidium cartilagineum f. ramosissimum, commonly known as the branched peppergrass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is native to regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It has finely divided, linear leaves and develops small, spherical fruits known as siliques. This subspecies is distinguished by its highly branched structure, which gives it a more dense and compact appearance compared to other forms of Lepidium cartilagineum."
