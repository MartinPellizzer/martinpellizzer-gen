    "intro": "Lindsaea decomposita var. normalis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with whorled, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures include sporophylls that bear spores, typical of the leptosporangiate ferns. This variant is distinguished by its slender morphology and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial mosses in humid, tropical ecosystems."
