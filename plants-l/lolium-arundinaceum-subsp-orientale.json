    "intro": "Lolium arundinaceum subsp. orientale, commonly known as oriental ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
