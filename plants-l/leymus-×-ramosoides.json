    "intro": "Leymus \u00d7 ramosoides, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish-colored stems. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically panicle-like, bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Botanically, it is notable for its hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between Leymus arenarius and Leymus triticoides."
