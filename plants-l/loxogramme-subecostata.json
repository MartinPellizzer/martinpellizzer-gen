    "intro": "Loxogramme subecostata, commonly known as the narrow-costleaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its fronds float on the water surface. Loxogramme subecostata is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
