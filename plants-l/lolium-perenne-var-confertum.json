    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. confertum, commonly known as tall ryegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tall, dense growth habit. It features narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically dark green in color and have a smooth texture. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value. This variety is also valued for its ability to establish quickly and form a dense sod, making it suitable for erosion control."
