    "intro": "Lepisorus loriformis var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than they are wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates in mountainous areas. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
