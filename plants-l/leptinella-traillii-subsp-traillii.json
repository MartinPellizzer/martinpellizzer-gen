    "intro": "Leptinella traillii subsp. traillii, commonly known as the Traill's lepidote, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or scree habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in New Zealand."
