It features small, opposite leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
