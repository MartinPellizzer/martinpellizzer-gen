    "intro": "Limivasculum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a unique type of resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance ingredient. Its botanical classification places it within the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and avocado. Due to overharvesting, Limivasculum is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
