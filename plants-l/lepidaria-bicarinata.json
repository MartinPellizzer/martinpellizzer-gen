    "intro": "Lepidaria bicarinata, commonly known as the two-edged fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bi-lobed, giving it the common name. The plant is native to the humid tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Lepidaria bicarinata is often found growing in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the presence of high humidity and well-drained soil."
