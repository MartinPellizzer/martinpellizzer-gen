    "intro": "Loranthus ponapensis, commonly known as the Caroline banyan, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and attaches itself to host trees, primarily figs and other broad-leaved species, through its haustoria. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains seeds dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
