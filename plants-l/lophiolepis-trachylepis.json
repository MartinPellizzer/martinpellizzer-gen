    "intro": "Lophiolepis trachylepis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy or rocky coastal environments, showing resistance to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, and it has a deep root system for stability in loose soils. Lophiolepis trachylepis is often found in dunes and along the coastlines of South Africa."
