    "intro": "Lycopodium coralium, commonly known as the coral clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, bright red or orange spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium coralium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
