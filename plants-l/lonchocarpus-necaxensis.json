It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, a trait shared with other members of the Mimosa genus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
