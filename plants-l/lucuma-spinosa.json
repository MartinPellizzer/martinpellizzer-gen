    "intro": "Lucuma spinosa, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a tropical shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, yellow-orange fruits that resemble small apples. The plant produces edible seeds surrounded by a sweet, creamy pulp, which is rich in nutrients such as vitamin C and fiber. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. Lucuma spinosa is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its culinary uses in traditional Andean cuisine."
