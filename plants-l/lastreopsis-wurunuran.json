    "intro": "Lastreopsis wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran rockmoss, is a species of liverwort found in specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, particularly in humid and shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a short stalk with a single capsule. Lastreopsis wurunuran plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
