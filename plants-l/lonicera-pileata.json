    "intro": "Lonicera pileata, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its vines can grow up to 15 feet long, making it a vigorous climber. While it is valued for its ornamental beauty, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
