    "intro": "Lycopodiella \u00d7 gilmanii, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella varia. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a dense, mat-like structure that forms a carpet on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodiella \u00d7 gilmanii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant hybridization and evolutionary adaptations."
