    "intro": "Linum sedoides, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Linum sedoides is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
