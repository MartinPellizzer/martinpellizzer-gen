    "intro": "Licania laxiflora, commonly known as the hairy licania, is a tropical evergreen tree belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Licania laxiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
