    "intro": "Lupinus campbellae var. bernardinus, commonly known as Campbell's lupine variant Bernardinus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed sites. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
