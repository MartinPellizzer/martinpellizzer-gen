It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that is covered in a dense layer of pale yellow spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stem is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
