It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green hue when fresh. This grass is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
