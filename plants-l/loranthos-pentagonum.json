    "intro": "Loranthos pentagonum, commonly known as the five-angled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive five-angled base, giving it its scientific name. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
