    "intro": "Lomatozona andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's lomatia, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, waxy, evergreen leaves that are often lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
