    "intro": "Lavenia montana, commonly known as mountain lavenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, Lavenia montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
