    "intro": "Loranthus angustitepalus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread. This species is found in Australia and is an important part of the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
