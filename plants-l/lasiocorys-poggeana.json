    "intro": "Lasiocorys poggeana, commonly known as the Boggy Poggean, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lasiocorys poggeana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
