    "intro": "Leucanthemum merinoi, commonly known as the Merino's white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which feature white petals surrounding a yellow center. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Leucanthemum merinoi is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
