    "intro": "Lyonia ovalifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lyonia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are elliptical to ovate in shape, and they are often covered in a fine, soft layer of hair. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
