    "intro": "Liparis nervosa var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
