It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and feathery, needle-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flower heads, which are often grouped into spherical or conical shapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
