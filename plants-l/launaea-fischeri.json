    "intro": "Launaea fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Launaea fischeri is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in extreme desert conditions."
