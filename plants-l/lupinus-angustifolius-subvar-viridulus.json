    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subvar. viridulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in ecological restoration projects."
