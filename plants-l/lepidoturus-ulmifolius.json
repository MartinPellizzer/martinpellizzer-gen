    "intro": "Lepidoturus ulmifolius, commonly known as the elm-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an elm. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are typically surrounded by specialized bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Lepidoturus ulmifolius is often found growing in clusters, with a mat-forming growth habit that helps it spread across suitable habitats."
