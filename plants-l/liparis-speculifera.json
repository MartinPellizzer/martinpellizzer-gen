    "intro": "Liparis speculifera, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in unstable coastal environments. Liparis speculifera is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats along the coastlines of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia."
