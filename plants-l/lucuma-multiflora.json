    "intro": "Lucuma multiflora, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange fruit, which are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and they bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lucuma multiflora is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which is used in traditional Andean cuisine and modern culinary applications."
