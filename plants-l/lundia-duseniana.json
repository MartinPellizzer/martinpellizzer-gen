    "intro": "Lundia duseniana, commonly known as the Dusen's lundia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and dark green coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lundia duseniana is considered a conservation concern."
