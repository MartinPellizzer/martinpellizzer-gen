    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata var. velutina, commonly known as velvet lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Velvet lespedeza thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
