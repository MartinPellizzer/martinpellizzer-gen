    "intro": "Loxocarya striata subsp. striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
