    "intro": "Lilium warleyense, commonly known as the Warley lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
