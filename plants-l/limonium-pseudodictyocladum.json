    "intro": "Limonium pseudodictyocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limonium pseudodictyocladum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
