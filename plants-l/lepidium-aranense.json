    "intro": "Lepidium aranense, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Lepidium aranense is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
