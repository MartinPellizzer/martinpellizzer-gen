    "intro": "Loranthus fulgens, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are orange-red and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
