    "intro": "Lindsaea pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern ally native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in spore capsules at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
