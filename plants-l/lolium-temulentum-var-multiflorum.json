    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
