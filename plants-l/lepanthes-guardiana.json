    "intro": "Lepanthes guardiana, commonly known as the Guardiana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns and a fragrant scent. The plant typically grows as a small, terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
