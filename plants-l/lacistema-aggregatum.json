    "intro": "Lacistema aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Lacistema aggregatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
