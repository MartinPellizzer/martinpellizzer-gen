    "intro": "Lagerstroemia fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, pale pink to white bract clusters that appear in summer, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, turning red or orange in the fall. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and long-lasting bracts."
