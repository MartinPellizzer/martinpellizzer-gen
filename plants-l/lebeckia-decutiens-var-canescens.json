    "intro": "Lebeckia decutiens var. canescens, commonly known as the silver lebeckia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
