    "intro": "Liparis gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
