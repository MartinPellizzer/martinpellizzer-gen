    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. suecica, commonly known as the Swedish twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in pairs on slender stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Linnaea borealis, particularly in leaf shape and flower size."
