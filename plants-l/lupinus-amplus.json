It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in summer.

It is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental value."
