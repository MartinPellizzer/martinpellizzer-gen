    "intro": "Lycopodium schwendeneri, commonly known as the Schwendener's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. Its sporophylls are clustered in cones, which produce spores for reproduction. L. schwendeneri is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
