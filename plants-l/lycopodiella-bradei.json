    "intro": "Lycopodiella bradei, commonly known as the Brade's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. Lycopodiella bradei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of early land plants."
