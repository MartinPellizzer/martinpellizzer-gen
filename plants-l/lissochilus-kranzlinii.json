    "intro": "Lissochilus kranzlinii, commonly known as the Kranzlin's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
