It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
