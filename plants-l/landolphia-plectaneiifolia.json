It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
