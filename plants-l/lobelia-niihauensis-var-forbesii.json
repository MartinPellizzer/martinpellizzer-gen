    "intro": "Lobelia niihauensis var. forbesii, commonly known as the Niihau lobelia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces a delicate, clustered inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
