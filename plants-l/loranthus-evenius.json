    "intro": "Loranthus evenius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by berries that contain sticky seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, though it is not always harmful."
