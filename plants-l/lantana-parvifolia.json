    "intro": "Lantana parvifolia, commonly known as the smallflower lantana, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, pink, or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Lantana parvifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
