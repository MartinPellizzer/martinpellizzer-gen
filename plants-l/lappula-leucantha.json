    "intro": "Lappula leucantha, commonly known as white lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant has smooth, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive beak-like structure, aiding in their dispersal by wind or water."
