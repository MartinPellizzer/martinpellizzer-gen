It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, elongated berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
