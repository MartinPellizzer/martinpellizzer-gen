    "intro": "Litsea ochracea var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often tinged with yellow on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and fruit. The varietal form oblanceolata is distinguished by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety."
