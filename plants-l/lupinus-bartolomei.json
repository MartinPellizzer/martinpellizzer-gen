    "intro": "Lupinus bartolomei, commonly known as the Bartolomei lupin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus bartolomei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for local pollinators."
