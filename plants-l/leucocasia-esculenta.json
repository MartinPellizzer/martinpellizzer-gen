    "intro": "Leucocasia esculenta, commonly known as the wild yam, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its tuberous roots are the primary part used, containing compounds such as diosgenin, which is used in the synthesis of steroid hormones. However, the plant is toxic when raw and requires careful preparation before consumption."
