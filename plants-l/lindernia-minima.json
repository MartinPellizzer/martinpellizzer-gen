    "intro": "Lindernia minima, commonly known as the dwarf lindernia, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lindernia minima thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid regions."
