    "intro": "Luzula oligantha f. atrata, commonly known as the black-leaved wood rush, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Luzula genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
