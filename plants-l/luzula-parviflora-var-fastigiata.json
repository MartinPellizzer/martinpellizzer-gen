    "intro": "Luzula parviflora var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Luzula parviflora var. fastigiata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
