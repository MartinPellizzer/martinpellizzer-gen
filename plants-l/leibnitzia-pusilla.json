    "intro": "Leibnitzia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf leibnitzia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
