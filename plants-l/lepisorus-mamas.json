    "intro": "Lepisorus mamas, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, typical of many fern species."
