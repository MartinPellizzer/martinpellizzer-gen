    "intro": "Lycopodium limidum, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, wet meadows, and forest floors. Lycopodium limidum reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it a valuable subject for studying early plant evolution."
