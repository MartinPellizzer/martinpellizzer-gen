It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact mat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice in xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
