    "intro": "Lotus catalaunicus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the Catalan lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
