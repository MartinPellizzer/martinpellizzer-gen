    "intro": "Lastrea decrescens, commonly known as the decreasing lastrea, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that gradually narrow toward the top, giving it a distinctive, elongated appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. Lastrea decrescens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unusual form and resilience."
