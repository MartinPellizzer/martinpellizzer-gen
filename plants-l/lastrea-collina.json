    "intro": "Lastrea collina, commonly known as the coastal lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Lastrea collina is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a resilient species in coastal regions."
