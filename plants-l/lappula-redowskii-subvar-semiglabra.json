    "intro": "Lappula redowskii subvar. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of hair, though the subspecies semiglabra has a smoother texture compared to other varieties. This plant is often found in dry, sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
