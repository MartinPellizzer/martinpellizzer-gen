    "intro": "Lepidosperma elatius var. planoconvexum, commonly known as the flat-convex sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil. This variety is distinguished by its flattened, convex flower heads, which give it its common name."
