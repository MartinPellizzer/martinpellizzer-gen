    "intro": "Lomandra hystrix, commonly known as the grass tree, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features a tall, grass-like stem with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces striking, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late winter or early spring, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Lomandra hystrix is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
