    "intro": "Leveillea, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their striking, yellowish-orange ray florets and dense, cylindrical flower heads. Leveillea species typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
