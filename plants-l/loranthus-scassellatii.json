    "intro": "Loranthus scassellatii, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the natural cycle of host trees. Its presence can influence the growth and health of the host, sometimes leading to weakened or stressed trees."
