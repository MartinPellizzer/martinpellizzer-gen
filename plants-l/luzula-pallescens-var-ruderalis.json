    "intro": "Luzula pallescens var. ruderalis, commonly known as the gray moor sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in various habitats. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, which is why it is considered a ruderal species. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions."
