    "intro": "Lethea cahnae, commonly known as the golden heart fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its lush, bright green fronds that often display a golden hue at the base, giving it its common name. Native to the tropical rainforests of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Lethea cahnae is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
