    "intro": "Lonicera hypoleuca, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lonicera hypoleuca is often found in moist woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
