    "intro": "Lagarinthus microdon, commonly known as the small-flowered spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its attractive foliage and delicate flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
