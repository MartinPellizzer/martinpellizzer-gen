    "intro": "Lunaria japonica, commonly known as Japanese moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, papery pods that resemble small moons, which give the plant its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small white or pale purple flowers. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Lunaria japonica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique seed pods."
