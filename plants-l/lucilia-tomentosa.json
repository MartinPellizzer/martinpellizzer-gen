    "intro": "Lucilia tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy bottle fly maggot. This species is a type of fly larva that develops in decaying organic matter, often found in moist soil or compost. It has a distinctive white, hairy body covered in fine, short hairs. The larvae are typically found in environments with high moisture content, such as near dung or rotting vegetation. Botanically, it plays a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems."
