    "intro": "Lastrea setigera, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, fleshy stems that often form a dense, shrub-like structure. The leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
