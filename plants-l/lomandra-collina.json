    "intro": "Lomandra collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Lomandra collina is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in both ornamental and ecological landscaping."
