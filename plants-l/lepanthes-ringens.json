    "intro": "Lepanthes ringens, commonly known as the silver star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a distinctive yellow lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in the spring, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Lepanthes ringens is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
