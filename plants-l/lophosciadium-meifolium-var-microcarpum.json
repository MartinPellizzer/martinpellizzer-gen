    "intro": "Lophosciadium meifolium var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited meifolium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, and it is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
