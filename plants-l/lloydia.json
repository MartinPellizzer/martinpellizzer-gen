    "intro": "Lloydia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white, resembling the color of the ghostly mist. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is native to regions in North America and parts of Asia. Lloydia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained conditions. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
