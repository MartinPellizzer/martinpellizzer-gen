It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
