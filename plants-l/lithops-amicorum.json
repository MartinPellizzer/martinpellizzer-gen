    "intro": "Lithops amicorum, commonly known as the friendship stone, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its two fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble rocks, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to endure long periods of drought. It produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring. Lithops amicorum is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
