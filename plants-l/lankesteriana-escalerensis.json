    "intro": "Lankesteriana escalerensis, commonly known as the Escalerensis flame orchid, is a rare and striking tropical orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its striking, elongated petals. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
