    "intro": "Linum bienne var. siculum, commonly known as Sicilian flax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branched towards the top. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in loose racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Sicilian flax is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
