    "intro": "Leptochilus pentagonalis, commonly known as the five-angled rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows on rocky soils and gravelly plains. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water. The species is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped seed pods, which contribute to its scientific name."
