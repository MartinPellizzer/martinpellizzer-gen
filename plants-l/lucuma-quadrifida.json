    "intro": "Lucuma quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf lucuma, is a member of the coffee family (Rubiaceae). It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. The plant produces large, yellow-orange fruits that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, custard-like flavor. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a distinctive four-leaf structure that gives it its common name. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in local communities."
