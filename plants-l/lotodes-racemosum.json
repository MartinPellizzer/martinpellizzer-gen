    "intro": "Lotodes racemosum, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lotodes, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom substrate while its stems float on the water's surface. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they play a role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
