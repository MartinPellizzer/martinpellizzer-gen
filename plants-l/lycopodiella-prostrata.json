    "intro": "Lycopodiella prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lycopod, is a small, ground-hugging fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often tightly clustered around its stems. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including strobili (cone-like structures), are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodiella prostrata plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
