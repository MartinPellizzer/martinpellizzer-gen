    "intro": "Lobostemon fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features hairy, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Lobostemon fruticosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
