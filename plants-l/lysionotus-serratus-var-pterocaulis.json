    "intro": "Lysionotus serratus var. pterocaulis, commonly known as the serrated lythrum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lythraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy spikes of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Lysionotus serratus."
