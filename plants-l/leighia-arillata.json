    "intro": "Leighia arillata, commonly known as the orchid with the red flowers, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting white or yellow lip. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the humid environment. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Leighia arillata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
