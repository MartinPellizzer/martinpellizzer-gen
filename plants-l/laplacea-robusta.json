    "intro": "Laplacea robusta, commonly known as the robust laplacea, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with serrated edges and a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Laplacea robusta thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
