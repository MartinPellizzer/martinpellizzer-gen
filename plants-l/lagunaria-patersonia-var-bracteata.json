    "intro": "Lagunaria patersonia var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its unique bracts, which are modified leaves, surround the flowers and give it a distinctive appearance. It is often found growing in sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in salty and well-drained environments."
