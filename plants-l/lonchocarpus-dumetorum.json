    "intro": "Lonchocarpus dumetorum, commonly known as the \"poisonwood tree,\" is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, often spiny pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally avoided due to its toxic properties. The tree can grow up to several meters tall and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests."
