    "intro": "Lobivia huascha var. calliantha, commonly known as the Huascha Beauty, is a compact cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It features short, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
