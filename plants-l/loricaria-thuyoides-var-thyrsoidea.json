It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
