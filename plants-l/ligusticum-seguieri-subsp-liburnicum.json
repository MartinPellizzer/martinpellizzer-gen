It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture and emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. The small white flowers appear in late spring, forming dense, umbrella-like clusters that attract pollinators."
