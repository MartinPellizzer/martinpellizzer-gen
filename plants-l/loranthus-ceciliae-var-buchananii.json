    "intro": "Loranthus ceciliae var. buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant's small, white or pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that attract birds for seed dispersal. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees are abundant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress to its host but is generally not lethal in moderate populations."
