    "intro": "Lobivia pygmaea var. polypetala, commonly known as the Polypetal Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
