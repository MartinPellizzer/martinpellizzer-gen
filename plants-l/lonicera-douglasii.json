    "intro": "Lonicera douglasii, commonly known as Douglas' honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and give way to red, fleshy berries in the fall. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
