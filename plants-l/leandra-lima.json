    "intro": "Leandra lima, commonly known as the Lima orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Leandra lima thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
