    "intro": "Lestibudesia recurva, commonly known as the curling lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lestibudesia recurva is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
