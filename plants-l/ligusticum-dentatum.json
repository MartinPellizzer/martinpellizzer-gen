    "intro": "Ligusticum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed lovage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Ligusticum dentatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
