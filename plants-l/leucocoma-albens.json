    "intro": "Leucocoma albens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Leucocoma albens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
