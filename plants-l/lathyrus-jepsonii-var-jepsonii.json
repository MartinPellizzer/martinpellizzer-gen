    "intro": "Lathyrus jepsonii var. jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
