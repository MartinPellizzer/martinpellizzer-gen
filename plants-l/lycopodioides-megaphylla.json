It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
