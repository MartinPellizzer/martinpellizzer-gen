    "intro": "Laurelia serrata, commonly known as the coastal laurel, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Laurelia serrata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
