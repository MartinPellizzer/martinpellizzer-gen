    "intro": "Lepanthes harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring white or pale pink petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes harrisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
