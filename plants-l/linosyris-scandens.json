    "intro": "Linosyris scandens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Linosyris scandens is well adapted to xeric conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
