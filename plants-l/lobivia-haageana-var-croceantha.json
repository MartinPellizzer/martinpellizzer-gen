    "intro": "Lobivia haageana var. croceantha, commonly known as the Crocea Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It has shallow roots and is well adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
