It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild."
