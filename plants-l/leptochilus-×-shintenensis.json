    "intro": "Leptochilus \u00d7 shintenensis, commonly known as the Shintenensis Leptochilus, is a hybrid plant species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited natural range and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and somewhat enigmatic species in botanical studies."
