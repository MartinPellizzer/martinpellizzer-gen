    "intro": "Leymus akmolinensis, commonly known as Akmolinsk grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
