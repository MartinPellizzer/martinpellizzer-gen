    "intro": "Lycaste deppei viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in rocky or wooded habitats. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
