    "intro": "Lophomyrtus obcordata, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to attach to host trees, from which it derives some of its nutrients. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Lophomyrtus obcordata plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests."
