    "intro": "Lobelia minutula, commonly known as the tiny lobelia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features tiny, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lobelia minutula is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
