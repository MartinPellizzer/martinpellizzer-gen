    "intro": "Leptodermis griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense clusters on steep slopes. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, adapting to the cold and harsh climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
