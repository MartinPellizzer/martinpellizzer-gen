    "intro": "Lepisorus subrostratus, commonly known as the narrow-beak huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, narrowly lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Lepisorus subrostratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
