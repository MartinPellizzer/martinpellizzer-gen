It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea piestocarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
