    "intro": "Lomaria fullagari, commonly known as the coastal lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the western coast of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Lomaria fullagari plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
