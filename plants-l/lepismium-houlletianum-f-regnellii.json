    "intro": "Lepismium houlletianum f. regnellii, commonly known as the Regnell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, thin stems and clusters of pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees and absorbs moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days, and it is known for its delicate, fragrant scent. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
