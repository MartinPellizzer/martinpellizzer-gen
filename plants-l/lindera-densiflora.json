    "intro": "Lindera densiflora, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, peppery flavor, making them useful in culinary applications. Lindera densiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
