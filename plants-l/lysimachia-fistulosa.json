    "intro": "Lysimachia fistulosa, commonly known as the creeping yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue along the edges. Lysimachia fistulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
