    "intro": "Leptochloa marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Islands, particularly in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
