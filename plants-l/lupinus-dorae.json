    "intro": "Lupinus dorae, commonly known as Dor's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus dorae is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation."
