    "intro": "Leptostelma, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a genus of parasitic flowering plants belonging to the family Viscaraceae. These plants typically grow on the branches of trees and shrubs, drawing nutrients and water from their hosts. They produce small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The berries they bear are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Leptostelma species are found in various regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
