It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lonicera bubalina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
