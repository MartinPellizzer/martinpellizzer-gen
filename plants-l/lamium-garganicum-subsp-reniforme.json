It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typically blooming in spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
