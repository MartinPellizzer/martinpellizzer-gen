    "intro": "Larnax sylvarum, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features feathery, compound leaves that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Larnax sylvarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to enrich soil with organic matter."
