    "intro": "Libidibia pauciflora var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, elliptical fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to its durability, the tree is valued for timber and traditional uses in local communities."
