    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. vermlandica, commonly known as the Swedish twinflower, is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of Scandinavia and northern Europe. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. This form is characterized by its unique morphological traits, including slightly larger leaves and a more compact structure compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
