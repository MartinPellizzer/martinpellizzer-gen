    "intro": "Lankesteria brevior, commonly known as the dwarf lankesteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical forests in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with prominent yellow stamens, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lankesteria brevior is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
