    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. alba, commonly known as white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, tubular flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its red, fleshy berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
