    "intro": "Lathyrus acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lathyrus acutifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
