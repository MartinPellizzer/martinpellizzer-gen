It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like and covered in a waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium cordatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
