    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum provar. violaceum, commonly known as the purple tomato, is a botanical variant of the common tomato. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple to violet pigmentation, primarily due to the accumulation of anthocyanins. The plant exhibits the typical morphology of the Solanaceae family, with simple leaves and a sprawling growth habit. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fruits with a firm, meaty texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and nutrient-rich content, making it suitable for both culinary and horticultural use."
