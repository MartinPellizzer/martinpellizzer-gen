    "intro": "Lindernia punctata, commonly known as the spotted lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia punctata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
