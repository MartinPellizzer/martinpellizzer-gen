    "intro": "Lepanthes ferdinandiana, commonly known as the Ferdinand's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients, and it has a short, stocky stem with broad, waxy leaves. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
