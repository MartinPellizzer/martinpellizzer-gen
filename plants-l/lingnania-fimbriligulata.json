    "intro": "Lingnania fimbriligulata, commonly known as the fringed-winged fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the leaves of true ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation. The fringed edges of its leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its scientific name."
