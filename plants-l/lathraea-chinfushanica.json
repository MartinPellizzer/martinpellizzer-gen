    "intro": "Lathraea chinfushanica, commonly known as the Chinese lily, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to China. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a single, showy flower that resembles a lily, often with a violet or pink hue. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Lathraea chinfushanica is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the roots of other plants."
