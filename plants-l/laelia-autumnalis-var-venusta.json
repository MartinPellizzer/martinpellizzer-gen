It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, making it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soil and moderate light conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
