    "intro": "Lolium rigidum subsp. negevense, commonly known as the rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
