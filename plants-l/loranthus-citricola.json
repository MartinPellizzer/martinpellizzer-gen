    "intro": "Loranthus citricola, commonly known as the citrus dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of host trees, primarily in the Rutaceae family. It lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries containing seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and health of its host plants."
