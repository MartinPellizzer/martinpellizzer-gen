It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are borne on specialized structures called strobili. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, which is a key feature of its life cycle. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
