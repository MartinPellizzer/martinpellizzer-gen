It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus popayanensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
