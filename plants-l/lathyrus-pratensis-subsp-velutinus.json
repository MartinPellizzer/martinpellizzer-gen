    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis subsp. velutinus, commonly known as velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Velvet vetch is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in ecological succession."
