    "intro": "Lappa tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a hairy, sprawling stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in fine, white tomentum. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lappa tomentosa is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates."
