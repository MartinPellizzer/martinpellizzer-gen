The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically not consumed by humans but are used in botanical research. It is closely related to the domesticated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, and is valued for its genetic diversity. This species is often studied for its potential to improve crop resilience in breeding programs."
