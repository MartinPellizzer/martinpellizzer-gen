It is a woody plant characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
