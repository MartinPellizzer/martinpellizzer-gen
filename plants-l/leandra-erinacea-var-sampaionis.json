    "intro": "Leandra erinacea var. sampaionis, commonly known as the Sampaion's leandra, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
