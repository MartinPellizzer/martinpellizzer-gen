    "intro": "Lanessania turbinata, commonly known as the turban lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, turban-shaped thallus that is typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to lichenologists and environmental scientists."
