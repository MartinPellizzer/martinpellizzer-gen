    "intro": "Leiocarpus serratus, commonly known as the serrated ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and durable wood, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural habitat."
