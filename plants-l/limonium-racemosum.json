    "intro": "Limonium racemosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has silvery, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Limonium racemosum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
