    "intro": "Lepidium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf mustard, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, which gives it its common name, and it has a peppery scent when crushed. Lepidium sagittatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
