    "intro": "Lomaria trichomanoides, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of true maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of ferns. Lomaria trichomanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
