    "intro": "Leucothoe ambigua var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
