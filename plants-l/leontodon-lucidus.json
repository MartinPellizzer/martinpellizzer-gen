It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its bright yellow flowers are followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily by wind. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
