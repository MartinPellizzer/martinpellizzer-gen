    "intro": "Lindsaea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called soruses on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea sessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
