    "intro": "Lactuca watsoniana, commonly known as Watson's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has basal leaves that are often hairy and can be quite large, with a rosette growth habit. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white to light brown seeds. Watson's lettuce is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
