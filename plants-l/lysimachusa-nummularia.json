    "intro": "Lysimachusa nummularia, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to East Asia. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, creating a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is particularly attractive in the winter when other plants are dormant."
