It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and edible leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in salads, though they are less commonly consumed than those of other lettuce varieties. Lactuca scandens is also known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
