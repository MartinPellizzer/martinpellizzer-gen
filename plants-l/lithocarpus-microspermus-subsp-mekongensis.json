    "intro": "Lithocarpus microspermus subsp. mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, dense wood and evergreen leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to mid-elevation forests. Its ecological significance lies in its role as both a keystone species and a valuable timber resource in its native habitats."
