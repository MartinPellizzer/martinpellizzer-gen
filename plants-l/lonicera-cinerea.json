    "intro": "Lonicera cinerea, commonly known as gray honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that are often covered in a distinctive grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are typically yellow or white, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera cinerea is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
