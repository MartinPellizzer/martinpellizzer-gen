    "intro": "Limnophila javanica, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Limnophila javanica is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense mats in aquatic settings."
