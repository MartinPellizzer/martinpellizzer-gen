    "intro": "Loranthus muerensis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of various host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees grow. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in forestry and agriculture."
