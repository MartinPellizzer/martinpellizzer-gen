    "intro": "Lonicera involucrata var. humilis, commonly known as the low bush honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in late summer, providing food for birds and small mammals."
