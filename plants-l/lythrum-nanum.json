It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in spikes along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Lythrum nanum is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
