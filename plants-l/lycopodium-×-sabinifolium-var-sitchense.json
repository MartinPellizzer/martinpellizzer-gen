    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 sabinifolium var. sitchense, commonly known as the Siberian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, forested areas with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
