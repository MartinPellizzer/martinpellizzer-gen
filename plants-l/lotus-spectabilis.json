It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the surface of still water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged. Its roots grow in the muddy bottom of ponds and lakes, anchoring the plant in place. Lotus spectabilis is known for its ability to thrive in still water environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
