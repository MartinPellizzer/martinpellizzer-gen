    "intro": "Leucothoe multiflora var. pohlii, commonly known as the Appalachian leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the autumn. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
