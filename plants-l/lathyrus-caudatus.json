    "intro": "Lathyrus caudatus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, beard-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which are typically arranged in drooping clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Lathyrus caudatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can also be found growing wild in meadows and along roadsides."
