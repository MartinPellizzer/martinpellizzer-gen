    "intro": "Leptorkis plantaginea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in hue. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain environments."
