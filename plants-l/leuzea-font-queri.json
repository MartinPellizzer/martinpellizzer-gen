    "intro": "Leuzea font-queri, commonly known as the mountain leuzea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. Leuzea font-queri is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
