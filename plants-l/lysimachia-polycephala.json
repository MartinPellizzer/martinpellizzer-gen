    "intro": "Lysimachia polycephala, commonly known as golden thread, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wetlands."
