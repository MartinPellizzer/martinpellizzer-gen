    "intro": "Lindsaea bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants adapted to grow on other plants rather than in soil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a dense canopy, often trapping moisture and debris. Lindsaea bakeri produces small, greenish flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf rosette, and it relies on wind pollination. Its unique botanical structure makes it well-suited for its epiphytic lifestyle in humid, shaded environments."
