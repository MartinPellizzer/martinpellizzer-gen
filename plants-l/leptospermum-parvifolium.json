    "intro": "Leptospermum parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
