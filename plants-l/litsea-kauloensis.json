    "intro": "Litsea kauloensis, commonly known as the Kaulon Island-laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the island of Kaulon in the Philippines, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. It produces dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Litsea kauloensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
