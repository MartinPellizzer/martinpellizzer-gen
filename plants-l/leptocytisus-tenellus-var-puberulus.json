    "intro": "Leptocytisus tenellus var. puberulus, commonly known as the silver weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and also bear a fuzzy texture, contributing to its overall soft, matte look. It produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively low maintenance."
