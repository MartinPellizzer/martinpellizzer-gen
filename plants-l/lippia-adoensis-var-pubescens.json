It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, often with a strong, mint-like fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Lippia adoensis var. pubescens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
