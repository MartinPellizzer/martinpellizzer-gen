    "intro": "Lobelia bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
