It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with hairy stems and alternate leaves. The flowers are usually yellow with a central disk, resembling those of true sunflowers. Laggera species are often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
