    "intro": "Loranthus brandisianus, commonly known as the Brandis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the sugars it produces. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
