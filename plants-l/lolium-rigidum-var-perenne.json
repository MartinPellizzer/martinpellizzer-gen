    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. perenne, commonly known as perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with upright, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned lemmas. It is widely used in pasture and forage systems due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment. Lolium rigidum var. perenne is also a common weed in agricultural fields and can be difficult to control due to its vigorous growth and adaptability."
