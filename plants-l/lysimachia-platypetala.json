It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes used in gardens and as a ground cover."
