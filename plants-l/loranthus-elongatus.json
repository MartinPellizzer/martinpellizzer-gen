    "intro": "Loranthus elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus elongatus is found in various parts of Asia and is often associated with species like the Chinese schima and other broad-leaved trees."
