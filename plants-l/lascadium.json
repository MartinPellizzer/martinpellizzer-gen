    "intro": "Lascadium, commonly known as the red sanders or red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, with species like *Lascadium corymbosum* being particularly notable. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lascadium species are typically shrubs or herbs, growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to overharvesting, some species are now considered endangered, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
