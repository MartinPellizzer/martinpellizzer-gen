    "intro": "Lactuca tenerrima, commonly known as the bitter lettuce or wild endive, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically bitter in taste. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are visited by various pollinators. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Lactuca tenerrima is sometimes used in salads or as a medicinal herb, though its bitterness limits its culinary use."
