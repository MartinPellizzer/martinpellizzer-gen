    "intro": "Loranthus haematodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to various host trees, primarily in the families Rutaceae and Fagaceae. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, red berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating attachment to new host plants. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems, though its parasitic nature can cause stress to host trees."
