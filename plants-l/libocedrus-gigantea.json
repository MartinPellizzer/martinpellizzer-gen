    "intro": "Libocedrus gigantea, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, furrowed bark and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Libocedrus gigantea is known for its longevity and can live for thousands of years, making it one of the oldest living organisms on Earth. Its botanical features make it a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
