    "intro": "Lisianthius ophiorriza, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
