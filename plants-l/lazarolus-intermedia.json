    "intro": "Lazarolus intermedia, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a star. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The leaves are usually bright green and emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance when touched."
