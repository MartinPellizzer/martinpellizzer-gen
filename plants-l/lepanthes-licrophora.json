    "intro": "Lepanthes licrophora, commonly known as the red-bellied orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red and green coloration on its petals and sepals, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Lepanthes licrophora is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
