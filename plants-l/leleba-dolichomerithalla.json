    "intro": "Leleba dolichomerithalla, commonly known as the long-stemmed leleba, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leleba dolichomerithalla is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
