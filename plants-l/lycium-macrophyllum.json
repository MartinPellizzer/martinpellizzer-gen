    "intro": "Lycium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Lycium macrophyllum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert species."
