    "intro": "Linaria lanigera, commonly known as the woolly toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linaria lanigera is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is considered a perennial herb and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
