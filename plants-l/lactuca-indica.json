    "intro": "Lactuca indica, commonly known as Indian lettuce or wild endive, is an annual flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curly and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiky fruits called achenes. Lactuca indica is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its culinary use is less common compared to other lettuce varieties."
