    "intro": "Licania tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui licania, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in cloud forests. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the tepuis, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
