    "intro": "Lomariopsis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lomariopsis, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Lomariopsis intermedia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
