    "intro": "Lotus arenarius var. canescens, commonly known as the sand lotus or desert lotus, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
