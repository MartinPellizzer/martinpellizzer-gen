    "intro": "Lupinus adscendens, commonly known as the ascending lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spires of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus adscendens has deep taproots that help it thrive in arid and rocky soils, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
