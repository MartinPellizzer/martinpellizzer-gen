    "intro": "Lithocardium mariquitense, commonly known as the Mariquitense rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas, which provide the specific mineral conditions it requires. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower spike that emerges from the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lithocardium mariquitense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
