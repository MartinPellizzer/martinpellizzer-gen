    "intro": "Lebbiea, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and dense foliage. Lebbiea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom throughout the year makes it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
