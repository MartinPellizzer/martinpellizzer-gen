    "intro": "Lysimachia pumila, commonly known as dwarf loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
