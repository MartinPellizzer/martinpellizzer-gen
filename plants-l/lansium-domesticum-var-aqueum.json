    "intro": "Lansium domesticum var. aqueum, commonly known as the water lansium, is a variant of the lansium tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit of this plant is typically smaller than the standard lansium and has a unique, mildly acidic flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible fruit."
