    "intro": "Lophostachys bradei, commonly known as the desert broom, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lophostachys bradei is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
