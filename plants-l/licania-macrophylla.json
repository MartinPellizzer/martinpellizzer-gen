    "intro": "Licania macrophylla, commonly known as the giant licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Licania macrophylla is often found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
