    "intro": "Lactaria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered milk cap, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow cap, which often has a sticky, milky substance when cut, giving it its common name. The stem is typically slender and may have a slight sheen, while the gills are initially pale and turn yellow as the fungus matures. It grows in woodland areas, often on decaying wood, and is found throughout Europe and parts of North America. This fungus is generally considered edible but should be consumed with caution due to potential confusion with toxic species."
