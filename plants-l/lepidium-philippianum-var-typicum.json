    "intro": "Lepidium philippianum var. typicum, commonly known as the Philippine cress, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a slight pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its native range."
