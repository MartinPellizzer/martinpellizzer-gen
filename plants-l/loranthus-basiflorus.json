    "intro": "Loranthus basiflorus, commonly known as the basal-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy and red, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus basiflorus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of tropical forests, influencing host tree health and supporting avian populations."
