    "intro": "Lasiandra macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It has small, glossy, ovate leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are red or orange when mature and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Lasiandra macrophylla typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, forming dense, bushy growths."
