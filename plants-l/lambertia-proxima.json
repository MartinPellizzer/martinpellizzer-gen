    "intro": "Lambertia proxima, commonly known as the coastal lambertia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces bright red, tubular flowers that attract birds and insects, playing a role in pollination. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Lambertia proxima is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
