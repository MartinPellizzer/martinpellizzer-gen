    "intro": "Lithospermum aggregatum, commonly known as clustered lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is characterized by the presence of rootstocks that can produce new shoots, contributing to its clumping growth habit. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses involving its roots and leaves."
