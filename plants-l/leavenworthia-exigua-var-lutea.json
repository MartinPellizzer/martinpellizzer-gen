    "intro": "Leavenworthia exigua var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and inflated, bladder-like pods that contain seeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
