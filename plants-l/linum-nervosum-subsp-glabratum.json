    "intro": "Linum nervosum subsp. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth flax or glabrate flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which lack the hairy texture found in other forms of Linum nervosum. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
