It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Lerchia linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
