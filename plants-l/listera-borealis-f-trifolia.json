    "intro": "Listera borealis f. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved spring beauty, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. It blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of trees has fully developed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
