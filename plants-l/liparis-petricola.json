    "intro": "Liparis petricola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or among stones. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Liparis petricola is valued for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in its native environment."
