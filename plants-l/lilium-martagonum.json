The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, and the plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Lilium martagonum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also found in natural habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
