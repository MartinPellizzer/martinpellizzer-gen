    "intro": "Lysimachia verruculosa, commonly known as the woolly yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and suitable for xeriscaping."
