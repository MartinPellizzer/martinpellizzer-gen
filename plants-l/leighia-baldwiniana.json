    "intro": "Leighia baldwiniana, commonly known as the Baldwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its delicate structure and unique appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered."
