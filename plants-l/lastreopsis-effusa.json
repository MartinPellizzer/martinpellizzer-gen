    "intro": "Lastreopsis effusa, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. The thallus is typically bright green or yellowish, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is often found on granite and sandstone surfaces in temperate regions. This lichen plays a role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of air quality."
