It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that form a rosette structure, often with a dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical forests, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including small, clustered flowers, are borne on specialized inflorescences. This variant is notable for its compact size and elegant appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
