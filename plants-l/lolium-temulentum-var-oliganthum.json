    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. oliganthum, commonly known as silver vetch, is a variant of the annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or silver-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. While not widely cultivated, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
