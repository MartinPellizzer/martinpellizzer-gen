    "intro": "Luzula pedemontana, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes true grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Luzula pedemontana produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh climates, contributing to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
