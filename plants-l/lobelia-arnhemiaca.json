    "intro": "Lobelia arnhemiaca, commonly known as the Northern Lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia arnhemiaca plays an important role in pollination, attracting insects like bees and flies with its nectar-rich flowers."
