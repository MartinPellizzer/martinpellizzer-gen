    "intro": "Lomatolepis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants typically have a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help conserve water. They produce showy yellow or orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lomatolepis species are often used in rock gardens due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
