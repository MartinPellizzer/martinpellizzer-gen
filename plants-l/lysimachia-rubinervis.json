    "intro": "Lysimachia rubinervis, commonly known as red-veined chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often clustered in terminal cymes. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with prominent red veins, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
