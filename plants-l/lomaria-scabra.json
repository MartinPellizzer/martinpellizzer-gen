    "intro": "Lomaria scabra, commonly known as the rough lomaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Lomaria scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
