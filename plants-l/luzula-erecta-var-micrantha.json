    "intro": "Luzula erecta var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf woodrush, is a perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of clustered, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow, dark green, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
