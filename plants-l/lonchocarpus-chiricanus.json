    "intro": "Lonchocarpus chiricanus, commonly known as the \"senna tree\" or \"chiricanus senna,\" is a deciduous legume native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, and it is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability due to its association with symbiotic bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
