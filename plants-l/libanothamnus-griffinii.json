    "intro": "Libanothamnus griffinii, commonly known as the Griffin's shrub-rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native gardens."
