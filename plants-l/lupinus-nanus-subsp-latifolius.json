    "intro": "Lupinus nanus subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf dwarf lupine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters, and its clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with 5-7 leaflets, which are broader than those of other lupine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
