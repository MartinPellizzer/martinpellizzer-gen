    "intro": "Landolphia boivinii, commonly known as the African moon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces large, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often avoided due to their strong odor. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. Landolphia boivinii is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
