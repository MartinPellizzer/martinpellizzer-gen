    "intro": "Licuala khoonmengii, commonly known as the Khoonmengii palm, is a rare and unique species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often near water bodies. Its trunk is slender and covered with a fibrous, spongy material. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
