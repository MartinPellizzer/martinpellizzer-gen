    "intro": "Lupinus subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its pods contain several seeds. Lupinus subsessilis plays an important role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
