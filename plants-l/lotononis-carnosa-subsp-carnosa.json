    "intro": "Lotononis carnosa subsp. carnosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and erect, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
