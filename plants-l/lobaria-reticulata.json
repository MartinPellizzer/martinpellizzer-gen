    "intro": "Lobaria reticulata, commonly known as the network lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Lobariaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, web-like thallus with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, granular lower surface. The lichen is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments across temperate regions. It forms a symbiotic relationship with green algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nutritional needs. Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health."
