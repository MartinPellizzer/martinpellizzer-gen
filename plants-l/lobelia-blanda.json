    "intro": "Lobelia blanda, commonly known as the Indian pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Lobelia blanda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
