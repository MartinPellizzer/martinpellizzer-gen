    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum var. perniveum, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or meadow-like habitats at high elevations. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to protect it from habitat loss."
