    "intro": "Lahia kutejensis, commonly known as the Kutejensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lahia kutejensis is considered a vulnerable species."
