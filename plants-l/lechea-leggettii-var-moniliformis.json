    "intro": "Lechea leggettii var. moniliformis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Lechea. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is particularly notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
