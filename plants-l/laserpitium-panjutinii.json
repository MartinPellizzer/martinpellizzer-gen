    "intro": "Laserpitium panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutin's hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a series of small, leaf-like bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
