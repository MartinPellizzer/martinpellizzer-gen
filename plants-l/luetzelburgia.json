    "intro": "Luetzelburgia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and features striking, showy flowers that are often pale or ghostly in color. The plants typically have smooth, waxy leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. Luetzelburgia species are often found in open woodland or rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally not widely grown outside their native range."
