    "intro": "Lonicera deleiensis, commonly known as the Delie's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Lonicera deleiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
