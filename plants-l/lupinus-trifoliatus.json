    "intro": "Lupinus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus trifoliatus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
