    "intro": "Lophira procera, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and typically have five petals, often in shades of white or yellow. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
