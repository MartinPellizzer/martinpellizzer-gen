    "intro": "Leopoldia clusiana, commonly known as the golden club, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a short, thick rhizome with dense, fleshy roots that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces striking, yellowish-green inflorescences composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Leopoldia clusiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
