    "intro": "Lindsaea blotiana, commonly known as the Blot's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a distinct midrib, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Lindsaea blotiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
