    "intro": "Lysimachia tenella, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Lysimachia tenella is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
