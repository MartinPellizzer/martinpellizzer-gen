    "intro": "Leersia aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems. Leersia aegyptiaca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
