It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Lobelia thorelii is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat."
