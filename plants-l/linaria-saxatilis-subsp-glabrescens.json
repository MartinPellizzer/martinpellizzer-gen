It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. This subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous appearance compared to other subspecies of Linaria saxatilis. It is a perennial plant that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone-rich environments."
