    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. pubescens, commonly known as European bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, hairy, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glandular and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
