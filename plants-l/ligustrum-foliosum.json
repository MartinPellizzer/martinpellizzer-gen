    "intro": "Ligustrum foliosum, commonly known as the silverleaf ligustrum, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It is evergreen and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions. Ligustrum foliosum is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
