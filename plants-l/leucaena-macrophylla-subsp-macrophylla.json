    "intro": "Leucaena macrophylla subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf leucaena, is a fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves that are often used as forage for livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm climates with high sunlight exposure. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is often used in reforestation and soil improvement projects."
