    "intro": "Lepanthes glacensis, commonly known as the Glaciers Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white and violet floral coloration, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Lepanthes glacensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
