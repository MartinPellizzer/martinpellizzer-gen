    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lathyrus clymenenum var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved sweet pea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to white. The leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are broader than those of the standard Lathyrus clymenenum. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
