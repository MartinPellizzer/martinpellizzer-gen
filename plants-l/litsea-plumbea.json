    "intro": "Litsea plumbea, commonly known as the silverleaf litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale grayish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark red berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a fragrant, aromatic scent. Litsea plumbea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
