It is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that enclose a single seed, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its leaves are lanceolate, hence the specific epithet, and are often used in traditional medicine. This species is valued for its durable wood and ecological significance in tropical forests."
