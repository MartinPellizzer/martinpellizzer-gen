    "intro": "Lepachys columnaris, commonly known as the columnar cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has spiny, ridged stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. Lepachys columnaris is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
