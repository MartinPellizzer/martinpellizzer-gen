It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features narrow, aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for arid environments and suitable for use in native plant gardens."
