    "intro": "Lupinus barbatus, commonly known as the bearded lupine, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal regions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus barbatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
