It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may pose a risk to native ecosystems."
