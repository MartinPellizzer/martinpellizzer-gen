    "intro": "Limodorum dabia, commonly known as the Dabie lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive dappled sunlight. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and the flowers are usually a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Limodorum dabia is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
