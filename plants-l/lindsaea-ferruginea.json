    "intro": "Lindsaea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as spore-bearing cones, are clustered at the base of the leaves. Lindsaea ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
