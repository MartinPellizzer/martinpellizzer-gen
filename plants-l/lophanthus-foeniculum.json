    "intro": "Lophanthus foeniculum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, and its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant produces aromatic, fleshy roots that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Lophanthus foeniculum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
