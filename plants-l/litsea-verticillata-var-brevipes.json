It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
