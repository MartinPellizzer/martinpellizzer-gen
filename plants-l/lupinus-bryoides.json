    "intro": "Lupinus bryoides, commonly known as the sandberg lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, sparsely distributed leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. Lupinus bryoides is adapted to arid and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
