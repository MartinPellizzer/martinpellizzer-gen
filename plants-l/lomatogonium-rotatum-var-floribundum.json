It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
