    "intro": "Lourtella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Lourtella species typically grow as succulents, storing water in their leaves to survive in arid environments. They are popular as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Lourtella frutescens and Lourtella multiflora, which are prized for their ornamental value."
