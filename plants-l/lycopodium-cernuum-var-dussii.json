    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. dussii, commonly known as the Dussi's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
