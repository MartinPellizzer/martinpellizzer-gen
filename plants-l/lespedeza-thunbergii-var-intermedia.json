    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii var. intermedia, commonly known as sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
