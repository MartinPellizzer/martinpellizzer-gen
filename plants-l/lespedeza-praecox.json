    "intro": "Lespedeza praecox, commonly known as early lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza praecox is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
