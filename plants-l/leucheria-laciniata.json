    "intro": "Leucheria laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
