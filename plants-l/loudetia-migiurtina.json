    "intro": "Loudetia migiurtina, commonly known as the desert grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its wiry, tufted growth habit and bright red or purple-colored inflorescences, which are often strikingly visible against the sandy or rocky terrain. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which reduces water loss. Loudetia migiurtina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
