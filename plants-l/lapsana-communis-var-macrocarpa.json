    "intro": "Lapsana communis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as greater bur marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender bur-like structures that aid in wind dispersal."
