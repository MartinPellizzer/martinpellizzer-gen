    "intro": "Lindsaea lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobb's spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive rosette-shaped structure with whorled leaves that form a dense, cushion-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on long, branching stems and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea lobbiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
