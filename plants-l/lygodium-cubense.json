    "intro": "Lygodium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban climbing fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Lygodium cubense is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, moist climates."
