It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, maritime climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. This variant is notable for its unique ecological role and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
