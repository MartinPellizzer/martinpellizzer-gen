    "intro": "Lumnitzera lutea, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellowish-green and clustered in spikes, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by water. Lumnitzera lutea plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
