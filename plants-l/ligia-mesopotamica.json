    "intro": "Ligia mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian ligia, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Ligia mesopotamica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
