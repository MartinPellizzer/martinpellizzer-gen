    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. chloraster, commonly known as the Chinese white lily, is a variety of the tiger lily that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It features large, showy white flowers with a subtle greenish tinge, which distinguishes it from other lily species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its bulbous root system is composed of fleshy, white rhizomes that store nutrients for the plant's growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soil."
