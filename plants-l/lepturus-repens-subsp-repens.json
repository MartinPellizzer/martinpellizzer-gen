    "intro": "Lepturus repens subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping lousewort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
