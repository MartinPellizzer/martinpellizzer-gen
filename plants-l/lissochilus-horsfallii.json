    "intro": "Lissochilus horsfallii, commonly known as the Horsfall's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, and often white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem with a single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
