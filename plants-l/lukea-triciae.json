    "intro": "Lukea triciae, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its native environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers that attract moths and other night-flying insects. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Lukea triciae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
