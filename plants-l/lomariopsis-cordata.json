    "intro": "Lomariopsis cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as having a heart-like appearance. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
