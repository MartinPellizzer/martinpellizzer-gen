    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. meyeri, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Chile and Argentina. It features woody stems covered with small, spiny thorns, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in arid to semi-arid conditions and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control."
