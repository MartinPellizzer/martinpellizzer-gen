    "intro": "Lemna dimidiata, commonly known as the lesser duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water's surface. Lemna dimidiata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
