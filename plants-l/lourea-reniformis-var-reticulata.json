    "intro": "Lourea reniformis var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated lourea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a distinctive reticulate pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
