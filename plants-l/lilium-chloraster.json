    "intro": "Lilium chloraster, commonly known as the green-flowered lily, is a rare and distinctive member of the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its striking greenish-white petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lilium chloraster is considered a rare and endangered species."
