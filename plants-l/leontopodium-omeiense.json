    "intro": "Leontopodium omeiense, commonly known as the Emei Mountain edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of the more well-known edelweiss. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
