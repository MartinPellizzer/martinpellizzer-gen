    "intro": "Linaria navarroi, commonly known as Navarre's toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as crevices in limestone or sandstone. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria navarroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
