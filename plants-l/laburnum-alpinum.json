    "intro": "Laburnum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine laburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking yellow, pendulous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long, slender seed pods that turn reddish-brown in autumn."
