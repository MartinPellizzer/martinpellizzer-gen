    "intro": "Lobelia saturninoi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial herb that often forms dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and linear. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lobelia saturninoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
