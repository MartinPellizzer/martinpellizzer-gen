It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces spiny, cylindrical pods containing seeds. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Lupinus perglaber is also noted for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blue or purple flowers."
