    "intro": "Liparis endertii, commonly known as the Endert's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptation to humid, low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss, Liparis endertii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
