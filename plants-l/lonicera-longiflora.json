    "intro": "Lonicera longiflora, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
