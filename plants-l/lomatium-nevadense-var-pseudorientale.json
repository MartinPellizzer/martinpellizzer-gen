    "intro": "Lomatium nevadense var. pseudorientale, commonly known as the Sierra lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
