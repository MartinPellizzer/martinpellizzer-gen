    "intro": "Lasiocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a strong scent to attract pollinators like bats and moths. Lasiocereus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. They are also known for their slow growth and long lifespan, making them popular among cactus enthusiasts."
