    "intro": "Lagascea parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lagascea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Lagascea parvifolia is often found in open habitats such as slopes and plains, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
