    "intro": "Lachnaea burchellii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lachnaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
