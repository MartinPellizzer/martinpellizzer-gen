    "intro": "Lacistema rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, elliptical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woods and along roadsides. Due to its milky sap, it is also referred to as a milkweed species, though it is not a primary host for monarch butterflies."
