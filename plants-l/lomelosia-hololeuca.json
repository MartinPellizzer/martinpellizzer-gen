    "intro": "Lomelosia hololeuca, commonly known as the white-flowered lomelosia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
