    "intro": "Leucopterum, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These trees are native to Australia and are characterized by their large, feathery leaves and showy white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which gives the plant its common name. They are typically evergreen and can grow to significant heights, making them a notable feature in Australian landscapes. Leucopterum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
