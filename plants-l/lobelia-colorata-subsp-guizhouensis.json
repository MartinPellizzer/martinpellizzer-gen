    "intro": "Lobelia colorata subsp. guizhouensis, commonly known as Guizhou lobelia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province in China. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often hairy. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists due to its limited geographic distribution and unique floral morphology."
