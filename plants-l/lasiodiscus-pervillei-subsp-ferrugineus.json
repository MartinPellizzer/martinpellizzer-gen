    "intro": "Lasiodiscus pervillei subsp. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty disc lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, disc-shaped thallus. It typically grows on bark and soil in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The lichen has a reddish-brown to rust-colored cortex, which gives it its common name. Its structure consists of a loosely branched, crustose to foliose thallus with a dense medulla. This subspecies is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization."
