    "intro": "Lomatium gormanii, commonly known as Gorman's lomatium, is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine by indigenous peoples. Lomatium gormanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early spring bloom."
