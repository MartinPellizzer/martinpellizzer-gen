    "intro": "Loxanthocereus granditessellatus, commonly known as the giant tessellated cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that are covered in a distinctive, tessellated pattern of tubercles. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for pollination by bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant's structure and adaptations make it a striking example of xerophytic evolution in arid environments."
