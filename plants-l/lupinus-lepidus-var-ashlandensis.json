    "intro": "Lupinus lepidus var. ashlandensis, commonly known as the Ashland lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its erect, spindly growth habit and clusters of pea-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed sites. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators and its role in stabilizing coastal environments."
