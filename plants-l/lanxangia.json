    "intro": "Lanxangia, commonly known as the Laos orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Lanxangia species are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, often with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered threatened or endangered."
