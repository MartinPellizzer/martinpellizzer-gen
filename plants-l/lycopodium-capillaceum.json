    "intro": "Lycopodium capillaceum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that grow in dense, carpet-like clusters on the forest floor. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate and subtropical regions. Lycopodium capillaceum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
