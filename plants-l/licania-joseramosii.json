It is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Uruguay. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
