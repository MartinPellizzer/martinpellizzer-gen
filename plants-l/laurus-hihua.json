It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is glossy and dark green, and its fragrant, small white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine."
