    "intro": "Leptospermum rotundifolium, commonly known as the white tea tree, is a species of evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathland environments. Its flowers are a key source of nectar for native pollinators, and the plant has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. The species is also cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of honey."
