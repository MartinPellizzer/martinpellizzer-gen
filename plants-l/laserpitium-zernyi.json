    "intro": "Laserpitium zernyi, commonly known as the Zernyi's goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Laserpitium zernyi is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
