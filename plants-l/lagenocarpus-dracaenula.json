    "intro": "Lagenocarpus dracaenula, commonly known as the dwarf dracaena, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, dark green, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits, which are edible for birds but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is often used as a decorative plant in both residential and commercial settings."
