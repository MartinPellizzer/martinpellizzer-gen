It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind."
