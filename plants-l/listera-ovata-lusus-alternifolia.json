    "intro": "Listera ovata lusus alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, and it produces small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, meaning they are arranged singly along the stem, which is a distinguishing characteristic. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
