    "intro": "Loranthus liebmannii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
