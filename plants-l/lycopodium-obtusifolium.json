    "intro": "Lycopodium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are broad and rounded at the tips. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Lycopodium obtusifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
