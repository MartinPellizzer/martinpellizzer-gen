    "intro": "Limonia oblonga, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a thick, leathery rind with a sour taste. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and cold hardiness. However, it is not typically cultivated for its fruit due to its acidity and low yield."
