    "intro": "Latourorchis muscifera, commonly known as the musk orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, yellowish-green to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a unique, musk-like scent that attracts specific pollinators. The orchid's root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
