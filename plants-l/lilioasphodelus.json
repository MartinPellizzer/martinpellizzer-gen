    "intro": "Lilioasphodelus, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Lilioasphodelus has a short lifespan, typically living for only one growing season. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
