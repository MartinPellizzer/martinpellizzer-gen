It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. This perennial plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant's name refers to its resemblance to a hawk's beak, due to the shape of its flower heads. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and is often found in open habitats."
