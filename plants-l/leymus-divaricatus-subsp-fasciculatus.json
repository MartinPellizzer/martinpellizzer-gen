It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tightly packed. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
