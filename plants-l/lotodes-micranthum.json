    "intro": "Lotodes micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, floating leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Lotodes micranthum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
