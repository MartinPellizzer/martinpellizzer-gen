    "intro": "Lepidaploa edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's lepidaploa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes, exhibiting a low-growing, herbaceous habit. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidaploa edmundoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
