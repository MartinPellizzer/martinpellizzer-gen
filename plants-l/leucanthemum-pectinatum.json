    "intro": "Leucanthemum pectinatum, commonly known as the white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. However, it can be toxic to livestock if ingested in large quantities."
