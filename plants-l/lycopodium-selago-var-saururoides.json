    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. saururoides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to parts of Asia and Australia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia. This variety is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in woodland ecosystems."
