    "intro": "Lotus miyakojimae, commonly known as the Miyako lotus, is a rare and ornamental aquatic plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a striking visual contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
