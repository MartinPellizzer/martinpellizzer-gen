    "intro": "Lotus yollabolliensis, commonly known as the Yollabolli lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in shallow, freshwater lakes and ponds, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
