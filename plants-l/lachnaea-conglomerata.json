    "intro": "Lachnaea conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a dense, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and it often develops a powdery or granular texture. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, commonly found on calcareous substrates. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
