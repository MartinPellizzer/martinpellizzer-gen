    "intro": "Luzula tenella, commonly known as slender woodrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, mat-like colonies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. Luzula tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
