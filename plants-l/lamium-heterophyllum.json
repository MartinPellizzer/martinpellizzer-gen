    "intro": "Lamium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval to heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
