    "intro": "Limonium grandicaule, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in sandy or saline soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance. Limonium grandicaule is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
