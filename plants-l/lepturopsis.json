    "intro": "Lepturopsis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It comprises several species native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their hard, durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. Lepturopsis species typically have small, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
