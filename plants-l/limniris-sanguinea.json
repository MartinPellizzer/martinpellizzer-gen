    "intro": "Limniris sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodroot fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its striking red-pink spore-bearing structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Limniris sanguinea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
