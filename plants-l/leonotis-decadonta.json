    "intro": "Leonotis decadonta, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is evergreen, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
