It features dense, upright growth with elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries in the summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil.
