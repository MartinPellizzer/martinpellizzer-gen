    "intro": "Liebichia alpina, commonly known as the alpine liebichia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
