    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii var. simplex, commonly known as the simple lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
