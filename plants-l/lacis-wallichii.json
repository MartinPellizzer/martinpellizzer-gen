    "intro": "Lacis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in thin soil, while its leaves are narrow and succulent to conserve water. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Lacis wallichii is considered a rare and endangered species."
