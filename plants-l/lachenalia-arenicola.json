It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure and fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
