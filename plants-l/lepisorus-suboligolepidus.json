    "intro": "Lepisorus suboligolepidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humusy soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Lepisorus suboligolepidus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
