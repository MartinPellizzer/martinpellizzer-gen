    "intro": "Lachemilla trevirani, commonly known as the Terviran stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
