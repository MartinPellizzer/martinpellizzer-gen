    "intro": "Lepia, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy flowers. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is native to temperate regions around the world. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom. Its flowers can be white, yellow, or pink, and they open in the morning, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lepia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
