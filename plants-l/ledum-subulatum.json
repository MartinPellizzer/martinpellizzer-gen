    "intro": "Ledum subulatum, commonly known as the northern cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically reddish or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are dark red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Ledum subulatum thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
