    "intro": "Lepidium spathulatum, commonly known as narrowleaf peppergrass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
