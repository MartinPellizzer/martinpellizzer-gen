    "intro": "Lactuca procera, commonly known as the tall lettuce or giant lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, elongated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Lactuca procera is often found in meadows, fields, and disturbed soils, and it can grow up to several meters in height. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
