It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and edible leaves that are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. Lepidium arequipa thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and culinary purposes in its native region."
