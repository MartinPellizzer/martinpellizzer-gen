It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
