It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Lucinaea ramiflora thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
