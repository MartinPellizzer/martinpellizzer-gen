    "intro": "Lonicera rhytidophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not recommended for human consumption. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
