It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
