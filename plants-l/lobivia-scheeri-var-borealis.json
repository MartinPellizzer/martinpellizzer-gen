    "intro": "Lobivia scheeri var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic Lobivia, is a rare and cold-tolerant cactus native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
