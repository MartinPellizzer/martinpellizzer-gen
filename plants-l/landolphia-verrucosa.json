    "intro": "Landolphia verrucosa, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive cup-like shape. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild."
