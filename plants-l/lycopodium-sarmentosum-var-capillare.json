    "intro": "Lycopodium sarmentosum var. capillare, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to moist, shaded environments in the eastern United States. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, spiral clusters of spore-bearing structures called strobila at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are linear, pointed, and often crowded along the stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions and its ornamental appeal."
