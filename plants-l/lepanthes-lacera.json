    "intro": "Lepanthes lacera, commonly known as the slender slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble small slippers, which are typically 1 to 2 inches in size. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are usually oval and arranged in a rosette, and it prefers bright, indirect light with high humidity. Lepanthes lacera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
