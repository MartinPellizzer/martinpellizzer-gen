    "intro": "Lyonsia straminea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments, forming a dense, crust-like thallus. The plant's thallus is usually yellow-green in color, with a leathery texture that allows it to retain moisture effectively. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrient absorption. Lyonsia straminea plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
