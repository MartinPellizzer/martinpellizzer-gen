    "intro": "Lachnagrostis filiformis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It has fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Lachnagrostis filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
