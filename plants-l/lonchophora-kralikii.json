    "intro": "Lonchophora kralikii, commonly known as the Kralik's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
