    "intro": "Lindsaea annamensis, commonly known as the Annam lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous erect, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Lindsaea annamensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
