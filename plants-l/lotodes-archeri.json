    "intro": "Lotodes archeri, commonly known as the water lily of New Zealand, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of New Zealand. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically light green with a waxy surface, and it produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of the water body while its leaves and flowers float on the surface. Lotodes archeri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
