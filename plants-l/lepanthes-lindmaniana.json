    "intro": "Lepanthes lindmaniana, commonly known as the Lindman's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes lindmaniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded outdoor environments."
