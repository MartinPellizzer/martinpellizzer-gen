    "intro": "Lupinus fictomagnus, commonly known as the fictional magnus lupine, is a hypothetical plant species often used in speculative botany and creative writing. It is characterized by its striking, large, and vibrant purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is said to have compound leaves with a unique, serrated edge, and its stems are tall and sturdy, reaching up to three meters in height. It is believed to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. While not a real species, it has inspired discussions about potential adaptations and ecological roles in imagined ecosystems."
