It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are predominantly white or pale pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
