It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its small, fragrant flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Lindera selangorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
