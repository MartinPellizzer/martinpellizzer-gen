    "intro": "Lorentea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lorentea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lorentea prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some indigenous communities."
