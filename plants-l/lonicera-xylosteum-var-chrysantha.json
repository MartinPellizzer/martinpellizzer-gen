It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in pairs. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and wildlife benefits."
