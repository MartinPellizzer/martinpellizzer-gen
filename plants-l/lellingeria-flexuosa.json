    "intro": "Lellingeria flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible lellingeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, often creeping stems that can grow along the ground or ascend slightly, with a tendency to form dense mats. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in loose inflorescences, and may vary in color depending on the species. Lellingeria flexuosa is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
