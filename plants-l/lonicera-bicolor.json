    "intro": "Lonicera bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Lonicera bicolor is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
