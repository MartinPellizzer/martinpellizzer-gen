    "intro": "Leioligo pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty leioligo, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that give it a dusty appearance, hence its common name. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces primarily through spore propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
