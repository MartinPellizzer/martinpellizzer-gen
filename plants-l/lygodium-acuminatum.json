    "intro": "Lygodium acuminatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique climbing habit, using its rhizomes to attach to trees and other structures. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium acuminatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
