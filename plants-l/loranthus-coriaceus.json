    "intro": "Loranthus coriaceus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that aid in dispersal. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often considered a symbol of love and fertility in local cultures. Its unique parasitic lifestyle and ornamental features make it both ecologically and culturally significant."
