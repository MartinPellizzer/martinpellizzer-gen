    "intro": "Leea sambucina, commonly known as the black elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are white or pale green, followed by dark purple to black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
