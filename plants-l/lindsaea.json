    "intro": "Lindsaea, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Lindsaea species are characterized by their erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. They reproduce through spores rather than seeds, and their life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage. The genus comprises over 200 species, many of which are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions."
