    "intro": "Leucophyllum frutescens f. albiflorum, commonly known as silverleaf ceanothus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, showy flowers during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid conditions, requiring minimal water once established. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
