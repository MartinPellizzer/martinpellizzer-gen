    "intro": "Lorentea affinis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in areas with high altitude and cool climates. The plant features a slender stem that produces a single, showy orchid-like flower with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a relatively short blooming period. Lorentea affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
