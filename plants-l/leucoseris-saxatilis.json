    "intro": "Leucoseris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on cliffs, walls, and bare soil. The plant's structure is typically crust-like or foliose, allowing it to adhere tightly to surfaces. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of air quality."
