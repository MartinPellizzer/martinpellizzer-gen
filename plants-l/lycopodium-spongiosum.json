    "intro": "Lycopodium spongiosum, commonly known as the sponge moss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodium spongiosum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various microorganisms."
