    "intro": "Lysimachia saxicola var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola lyssimachia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features creeping stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
