    "intro": "Lyonia mariana f. vestita, commonly known as the white lyonia, is a rare and striking variant of the lyonia plant native to the southeastern United States. This low-growing shrub features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, providing a lush green backdrop to the flowering display. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
