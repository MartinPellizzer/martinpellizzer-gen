It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Leontodon elegans is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous grasslands."
