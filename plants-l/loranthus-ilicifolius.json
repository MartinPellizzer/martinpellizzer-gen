    "intro": "Loranthus ilicifolius, commonly known as the ilex mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host, typically members of the laurel family. It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis with its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species is often found in temperate regions and is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems."
