    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. semiglabrum, commonly known as the smooth ryegrass, is a variant of the annual ryegrass species. It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has a clump-forming habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage production due to its nutritional value."
