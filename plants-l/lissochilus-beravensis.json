    "intro": "Lissochilus beravensis, commonly known as the Beravens Mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, elongated petals and sepals, and they bloom during the cooler months of the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
