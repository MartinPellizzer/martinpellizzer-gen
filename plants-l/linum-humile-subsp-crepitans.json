    "intro": "Linum humile subsp. crepitans, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
