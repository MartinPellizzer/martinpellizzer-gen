It typically features slender, prostrate stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are often rounded or ovate. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are borne on short pedicels and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
