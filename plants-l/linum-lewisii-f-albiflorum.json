    "intro": "Linum lewisii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered flax, is a variant of the common flax species native to North America. It is characterized by its pale white or nearly white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial that produces slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with a fine downy texture. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
