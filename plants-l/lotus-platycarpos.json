    "intro": "Lotus platycarpos, commonly known as the flat-seeded lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, flat seed pod that gives the species its common name. Lotus platycarpos is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
