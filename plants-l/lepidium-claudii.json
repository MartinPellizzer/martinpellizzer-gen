    "intro": "Lepidium claudii, commonly known as the Claudius cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical, hairy seed pods. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slightly serrated edge, and it is often found in coastal areas. Lepidium claudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
