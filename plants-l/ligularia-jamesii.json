    "intro": "Ligularia jamesii, commonly known as the giant dock, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its striking foliage, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded gardens."
