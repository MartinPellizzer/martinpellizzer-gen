    "intro": "Lycium parvifolium var. peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but considered toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
