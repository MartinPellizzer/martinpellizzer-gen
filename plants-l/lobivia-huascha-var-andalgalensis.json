    "intro": "Lobivia huascha var. andalgalensis, commonly known as the Andalgalense Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant typically produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry climates."
