    "intro": "Leptodactylon pungens subsp. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's leathery fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
