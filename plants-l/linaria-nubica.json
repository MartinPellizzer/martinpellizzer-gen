    "intro": "Linaria nubica, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa and the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Linaria nubica thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones."
