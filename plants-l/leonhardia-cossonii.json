    "intro": "Leonhardia cossonii, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Leonhardia cossonii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes."
