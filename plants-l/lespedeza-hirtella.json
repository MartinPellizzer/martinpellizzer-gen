    "intro": "Lespedeza hirtella, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Hairy lespedeza is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
