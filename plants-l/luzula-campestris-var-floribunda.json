    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering goosegrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, greenish to brownish flowers that appear in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish or grayish hue due to a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
