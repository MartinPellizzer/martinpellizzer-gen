    "intro": "Larix olgensis, commonly known as the Manchurian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling off in autumn. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is well adapted to cold climates. It typically grows in forested areas and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities. The species is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
