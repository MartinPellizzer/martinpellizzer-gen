    "intro": "Lockhartia pandurata, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a series of leaves and flower spikes. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Lockhartia pandurata is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
