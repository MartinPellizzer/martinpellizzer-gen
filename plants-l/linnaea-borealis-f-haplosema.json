    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. haplosema, commonly known as the small-leaved twinflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a member of the family Ericaceae, characterized by its preference for acidic, well-drained soils in shaded forest environments. The plant features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. Its most distinctive feature is its twinflower clusters, which produce pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. This rare form is notable for its reduced leaf size and is often found in association with other boreal flora in cool, moist habitats."
