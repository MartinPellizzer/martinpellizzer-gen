    "intro": "Lumnitzera prostrata, commonly known as the mangrove shrub or sea grape, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has aerial roots that help in gas exchange and provide structural support. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lumnitzera prostrata is also notable for its ability to tolerate periodic submersion and high salinity levels."
