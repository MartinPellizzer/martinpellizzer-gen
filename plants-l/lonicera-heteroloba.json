    "intro": "Lonicera heteroloba, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries that follow the flowers are orange-red and contain seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
