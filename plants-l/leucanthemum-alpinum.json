    "intro": "Leucanthemum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its white ray florets surrounding a central yellow disk, giving it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Leucanthemum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in cooler climates."
