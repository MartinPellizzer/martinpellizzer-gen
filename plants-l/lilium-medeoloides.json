    "intro": "Lilium medeoloides, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Lilium medeoloides is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
