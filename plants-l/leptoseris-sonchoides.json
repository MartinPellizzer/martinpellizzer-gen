    "intro": "Leptoseris sonchoides, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline, adapting to salt spray and wind exposure. Its growth habit is prostrate, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the beach. The plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
