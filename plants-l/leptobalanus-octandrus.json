    "intro": "Leptobalanus octandrus, commonly known as the eight-lobed oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, fissured, and often flaky, providing natural camouflage in its rugged habitat. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a broad ovate shape with a serrated margin. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Leptobalanus octandrus is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
