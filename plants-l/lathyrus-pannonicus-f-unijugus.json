    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus f. unijugus, commonly known as the single-ovary pea, is a rare botanical variant of the common pea species. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a single ovary instead of the typical two found in the standard form. This variation is of interest to botanists due to its potential implications for genetic diversity and evolutionary studies. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its limited distribution and distinctive morphology make it a subject of specialized horticultural and scientific research."
