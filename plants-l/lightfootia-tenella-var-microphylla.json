    "intro": "Lightfootia tenella var. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature lightfootia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
