    "intro": "Lobelia alpina, commonly known as Alpine Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Lobelia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
