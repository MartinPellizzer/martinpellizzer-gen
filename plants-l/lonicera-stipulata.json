    "intro": "Lonicera stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with stipules that are often mistaken for leaves, adding to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its red, berry-like fruits are edible and attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Lonicera stipulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
