    "intro": "Lophiolepis ukranica, commonly known as the Ukrainian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on bark or stone in forested areas. The plant exhibits a pale to dark yellowish-green coloration, with a finely granular surface texture. It is primarily found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
