    "intro": "Lupinus guascensis, commonly known as the Guascensis lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. Lupinus guascensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and often thrives in rocky or well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil for other plant species."
