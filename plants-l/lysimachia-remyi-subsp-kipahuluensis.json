    "intro": "Lysimachia remyi subsp. kipahuluensis, commonly known as Kipahulu lily, is a member of the Primulaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a low-growing herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
