    "intro": "Lobivia famatinensis var. sufflava, commonly known as the Golden Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to northern Mexico. It features compact, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish hairs. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry, rocky soils."
