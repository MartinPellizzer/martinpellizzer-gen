    "intro": "Lellingeria epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has no true leaves and relies on its roots for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
