    "intro": "Leymus tianschanicus var. humilis, commonly known as the Siberian needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
