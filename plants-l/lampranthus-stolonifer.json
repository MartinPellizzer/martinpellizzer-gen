    "intro": "Lampranthus stolonifer, commonly known as the carpet plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the warmer months. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for arid environments."
