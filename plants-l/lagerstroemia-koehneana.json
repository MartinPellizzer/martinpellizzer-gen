    "intro": "Lagerstroemia koehneana, commonly known as the koehne's crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes more distinctive with age, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and dark green. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution."
