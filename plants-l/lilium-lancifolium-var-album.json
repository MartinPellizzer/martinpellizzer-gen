    "intro": "Lilium lancifolium var. album, commonly known as the white tiger lily, is a variant of the tiger lily characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that are typically 5 to 7 inches in diameter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The white tiger lily is also noted for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
