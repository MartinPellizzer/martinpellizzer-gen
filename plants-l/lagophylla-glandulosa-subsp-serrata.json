    "intro": "Lagophylla glandulosa subsp. serrata, commonly known as the serrated glandular everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are glandular and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting blooms."
