    "intro": "Lingoum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Lingoum acuminatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
