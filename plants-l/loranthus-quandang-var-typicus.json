    "intro": "Loranthus quandang var. typicus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Lauraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain one or two seeds. This species is widely distributed in China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
