    "intro": "Lonicera caerulea f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the standard species. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring. Its berries are edible, though they are smaller and less sweet compared to other honeysuckle varieties. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
