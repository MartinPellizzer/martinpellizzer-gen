    "intro": "Lithops karasmontana subsp. eberlanzii, commonly known as the Karas Mountains stone plant, is a species of succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is characterized by its compact, basal rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, a feature that helps it blend into its rocky environment. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
