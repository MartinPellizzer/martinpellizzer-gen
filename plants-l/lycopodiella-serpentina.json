    "intro": "Lycopodiella serpentina, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a small, creeping fern belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form a dense mat on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on separate plants and produce spores for propagation. Lycopodiella serpentina is an ancient lineage of plants, with a morphology reminiscent of early terrestrial flora."
