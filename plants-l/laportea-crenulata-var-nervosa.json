    "intro": "Laportea crenulata var. nervosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with prominent veins, which give it its botanical variant name \"nervosa.\" The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hairy foliage and robust growth habit make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
