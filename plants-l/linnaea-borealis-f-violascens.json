It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, oval-shaped leaves and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are typically clustered in pairs, giving the plant its common name. This form is characterized by its more intensely colored flowers compared to the typical white or pale pink variety."
