It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, granular hairs, giving the plant its varietal name. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
