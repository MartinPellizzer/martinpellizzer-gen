    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera tabularis, commonly known as the rough-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is well adapted to aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft substrates."
