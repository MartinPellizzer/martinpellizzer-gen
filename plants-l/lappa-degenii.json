    "intro": "Lappa degenii, commonly known as the Degen's hogweed, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to parts of Central Asia and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in complex arrangements. Its leaves are broad, deeply lobed, and often have a distinctive, wavy margin. Lappa degenii is known for its potential toxicity, particularly due to the presence of phototoxic compounds in its sap."
