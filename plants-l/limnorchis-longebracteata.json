    "intro": "Limnorchis longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bract water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically found in the water or on moist soil. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Limnorchis longebracteata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
