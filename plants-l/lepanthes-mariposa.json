    "intro": "Lepanthes mariposa, commonly known as the \"Mariposa Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Lepanthes mariposa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
