    "intro": "Loranthus leptolobus, commonly known as the slender-lobed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, drawing nutrients and water from them. The plant produces small, green leaves and red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, despite its parasitic nature."
