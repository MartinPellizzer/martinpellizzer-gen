    "intro": "Lepanthopsis barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of eastern Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, leafy growth habit. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
