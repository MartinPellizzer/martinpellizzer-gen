    "intro": "Larix dahurica subsp. cajanderi, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship."
