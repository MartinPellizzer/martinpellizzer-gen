    "intro": "Lemboglossum apterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, sticky, glandular hairs that trap insects, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
