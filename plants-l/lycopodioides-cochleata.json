It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its small, delicate structure is adapted for nutrient absorption from the substrate. Lycopodioides cochleata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
