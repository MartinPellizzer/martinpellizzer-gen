    "intro": "Lobelia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the sand verbena lobelia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Lobelia chenopodiifolia is an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native range."
