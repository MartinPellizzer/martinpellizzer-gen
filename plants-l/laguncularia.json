    "intro": "Laguncularia, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a salt-tolerant evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to exude a resinous substance that helps it withstand saltwater. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water. Laguncularia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
