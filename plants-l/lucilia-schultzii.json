    "intro": "Lucilia schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's blowfly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic blue or green coloration and is often found in environments with decaying organic matter. The plant-like name may cause confusion, as it is not a plant but an insect. Its larvae play a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Lucilia schultzii is often used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in legal investigations."
