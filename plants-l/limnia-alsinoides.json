It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been historically used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
