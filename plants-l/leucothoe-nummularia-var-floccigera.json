    "intro": "Leucothoe nummularia var. floccigera, commonly known as the silverleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shady landscapes. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, thriving in humid environments."
