    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland and heathland environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets of greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded conditions and its preference for well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Luzula multiflora."
