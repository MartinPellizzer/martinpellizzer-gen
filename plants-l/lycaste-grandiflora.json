    "intro": "Lycaste grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Lycaste grandiflora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
