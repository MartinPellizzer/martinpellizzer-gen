    "intro": "Lepanthes muscicola, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
