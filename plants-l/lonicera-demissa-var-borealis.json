It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and along streambanks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
