    "intro": "Lens vulgaris, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
