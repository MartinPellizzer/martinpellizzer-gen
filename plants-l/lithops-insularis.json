    "intro": "Lithops insularis, commonly known as the \"twin rock plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its two closely resembling, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, aiding in camouflage. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Lithops insularis is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
