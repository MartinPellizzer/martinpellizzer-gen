    "intro": "Liquidambar imberbis, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems, and its distinctive red, fuzzy fruits that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. The smooth sumac has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of dye."
