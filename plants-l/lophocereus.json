    "intro": "Lophocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are often used as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance. Lophocereus species typically produce large, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Lophocereus schottii, which is popular for its striking white flowers."
