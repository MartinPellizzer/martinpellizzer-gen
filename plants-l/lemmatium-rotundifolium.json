    "intro": "Lemmatium rotundifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved lemming plant, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in its native habitat."
