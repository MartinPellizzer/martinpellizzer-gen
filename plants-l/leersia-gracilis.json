    "intro": "Leersia gracilis, commonly known as slender leersia, is a perennial grass native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Leersia gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
