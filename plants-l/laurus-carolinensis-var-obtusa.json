    "intro": "Laurus carolinensis var. obtusa, commonly known as the Southern bay leaf, is a variant of the bay laurel tree native to the southeastern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring glossy dark green leaves that are slightly broader than those of the standard Laurus carolinensis. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong, spicy scent, and are commonly used in cooking, particularly in Mediterranean and Latin American cuisines. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both gardeners and chefs alike."
