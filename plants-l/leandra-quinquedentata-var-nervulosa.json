    "intro": "Leandra quinquedentata var. nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined leandra, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins that give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy form that makes it suitable for ornamental use in humid gardens. Due to its unique foliage and floral display, it is valued in horticulture for both its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
