    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis f. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less succulent compared to other lettuce varieties. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, papery seeds. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
