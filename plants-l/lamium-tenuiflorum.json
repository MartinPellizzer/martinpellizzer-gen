    "intro": "Lamium tenuiflorum, commonly known as dead nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. It is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Lamium tenuiflorum is also known for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly minty flavor."
