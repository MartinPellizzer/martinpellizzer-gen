It features a short, thick stem with dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and efficient water storage. This variety is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
