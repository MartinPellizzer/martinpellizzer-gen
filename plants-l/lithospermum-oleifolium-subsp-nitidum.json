    "intro": "Lithospermum oleifolium subsp. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
