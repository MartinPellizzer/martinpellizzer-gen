It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety down. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
