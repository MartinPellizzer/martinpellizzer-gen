    "intro": "Logania nanophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf logania, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. Due to habitat destruction, Logania nanophylla is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
