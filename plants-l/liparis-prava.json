    "intro": "Liparis prava, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the substrate. Liparis prava is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
