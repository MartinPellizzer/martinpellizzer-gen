    "intro": "Limniris chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare and delicate vascular plant characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow foliage. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and exhibit a striking contrast between the bright yellow upper surface and the darker green underside. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Limniris chrysophylla is considered a conservation concern."
