    "intro": "Lotus ramulosus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a species of water lily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in shallow freshwater habitats. Lotus ramulosus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
