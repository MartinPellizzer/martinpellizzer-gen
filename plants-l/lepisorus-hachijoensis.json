    "intro": "Lepisorus hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Islands water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Hachijo Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
