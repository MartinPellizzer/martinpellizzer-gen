    "intro": "Lindsaea hemiacroscopica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, with the leaves often displaying a waxy, glossy surface. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers, which are typically short-lived. Lindsaea hemiacroscopica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
