    "intro": "Luzula spicata subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers in early to mid-summer. The subspecies is notable for its morphological variability, which can lead to confusion with other Luzula species."
