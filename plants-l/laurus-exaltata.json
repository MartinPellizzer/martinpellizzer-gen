    "intro": "Laurus exaltata, commonly known as the mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a pleasant, aromatic scent. The plant produces showy, clustered white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodlands. Laurus exaltata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
