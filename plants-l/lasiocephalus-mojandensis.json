    "intro": "Lasiocephalus mojandensis, commonly known as the Mojandean hairhead, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy, grayish-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
