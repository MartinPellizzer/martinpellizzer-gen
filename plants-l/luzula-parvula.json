    "intro": "Luzula parvula, commonly known as slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Luzula parvula is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
