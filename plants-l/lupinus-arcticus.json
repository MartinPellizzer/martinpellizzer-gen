    "intro": "Lupinus arcticus, commonly known as the arctic lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus arcticus thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators in its native habitat."
