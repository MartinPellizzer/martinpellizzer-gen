    "intro": "Loranthus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red, fleshy, and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
