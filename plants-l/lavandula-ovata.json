    "intro": "Lavandula ovata, commonly known as Spanish lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, spike-like clusters of purple flowers and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for dry, rocky environments. Its essential oils, derived from the flowers, are widely used in aromatherapy and perfumery. Lavandula ovata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
