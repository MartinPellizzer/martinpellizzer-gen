    "intro": "Lycopodium serratum var. myriophyllifolium, commonly known as the serrated clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss family (Lycopodiaceae). It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and distinctive, serrated foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other lycopodium species."
