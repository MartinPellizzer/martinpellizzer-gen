It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows, roadsides, and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny, greenish-white blossoms. Leptocionium abruptum is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
