It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. Due to its rarity and horticultural appeal, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts but is challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
