It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant contains compounds that have been traditionally used for their stimulating effects, though it is not related to caffeine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and pharmacological studies."
