    "intro": "Lenticula minima, commonly known as the small lenswort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Characeae. It is characterized by its delicate, filamentous structure and is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's rhizoids anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its stems bear small, spirally arranged branches. Lenticula minima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. Its simple morphology and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it an important component of aquatic botanical studies."
