    "intro": "Lindsaea austrosinica, commonly known as the Chinese whorled fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Lindsaea austrosinica is native to southeastern Asia, including regions of China, Vietnam, and Indonesia."
