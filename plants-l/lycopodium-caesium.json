    "intro": "Lycopodium caesium, commonly known as the ground pine or slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that resemble those of a pine tree. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its slow growth and limited spread, it is considered a rare and conservation-sensitive species."
