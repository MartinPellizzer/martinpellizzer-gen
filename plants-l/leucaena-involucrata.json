    "intro": "Leucaena involucrata, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually trifoliate or pinnately compound, and its small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Leucaena involucrata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in agroforestry and soil stabilization efforts."
