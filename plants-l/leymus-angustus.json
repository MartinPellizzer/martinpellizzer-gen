    "intro": "Leymus angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Leymus angustus is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
