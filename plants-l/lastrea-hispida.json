    "intro": "Lastrea hispida, commonly known as the hispid lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Lastrea hispida is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
