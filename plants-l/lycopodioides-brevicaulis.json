It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with a short, erect stem and whorled leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. Its sporophyte produces spores in small, club-shaped structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Lycopodioides brevicaulis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
