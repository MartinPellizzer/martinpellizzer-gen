    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 multiflora, commonly known as the everlasting lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces small, round, papery fruits that persist on the plant for extended periods, giving it its common name. It is widely used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
