    "intro": "Lilium wigginsii, commonly known as Wiggins' lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red stripe down the central column. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in high-elevation habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
