    "intro": "Lomatium foeniculaceum subsp. fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf structure, particularly the presence of fringed margins."
