    "intro": "Labramia platanoides, commonly known as the American boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded shape, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Labramia platanoides thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, preferring a humid, temperate climate."
