    "intro": "Lactomamillaria, commonly known as the milkweed milkplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which contains toxic compounds such as cardenolides. Lactomamillaria species typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The leaves are usually opposite and have a rough texture, while the stems are often hairy and branching."
