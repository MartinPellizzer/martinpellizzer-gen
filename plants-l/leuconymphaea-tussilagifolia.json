    "intro": "Leuconymphaea tussilagifolia, commonly known as the tussilagifoliate leuconymphaea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of the common ragwort, tussilago. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
