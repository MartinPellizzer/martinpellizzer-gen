    "intro": "Loranthus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It attaches to its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus, through a specialized root-like structure called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its elliptical, leathery leaves are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses its sticky seeds, which can adhere to other host plants."
