    "intro": "Lathyrus oleraceus var. arvense, commonly known as field vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
