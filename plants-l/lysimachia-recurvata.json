    "intro": "Lysimachia recurvata, commonly known as the curly willow or mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial with creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia recurvata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
