    "intro": "Lupinus pusillus subsp. intermontanus, commonly known as the mountain lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are pinnately divided into several pairs of small, oval leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats at higher elevations. Lupinus pusillus subsp. intermontanus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
