    "intro": "Lapsana parviflora, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It has slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Lapsana parviflora is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
