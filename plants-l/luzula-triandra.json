    "intro": "Luzula triandra, commonly known as the slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Luzula triandra typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in its habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in temperate regions."
