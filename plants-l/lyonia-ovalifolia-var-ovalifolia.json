    "intro": "Lyonia ovalifolia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat."
