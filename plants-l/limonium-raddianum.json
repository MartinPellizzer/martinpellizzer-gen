    "intro": "Limonium raddianum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Limonium raddianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
