    "intro": "Launaea procumbens, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often spreading via horizontal stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Launaea procumbens is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
