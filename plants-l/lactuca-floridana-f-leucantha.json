    "intro": "Lactuca floridana f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered lettuce, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Florida. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, lettuce-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuce varieties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
