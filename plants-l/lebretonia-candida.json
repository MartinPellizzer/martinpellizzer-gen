    "intro": "Lebretonia candida, commonly known as the white-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Lebretonia candida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
