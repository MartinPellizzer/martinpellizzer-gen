    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha f. wessneriana, commonly known as the Wessner's lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti adapted to drought. This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
