It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils. Lupinus calcaratus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
