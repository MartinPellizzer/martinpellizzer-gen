    "intro": "Lilium leichtlinii var. majus, commonly known as the giant white lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. This variety is distinguished by its large, white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
