It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Lycianthes uncinella is characterized by its erect growth habit and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments."
