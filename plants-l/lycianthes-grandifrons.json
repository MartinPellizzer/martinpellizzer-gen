    "intro": "Lycianthes grandifrons, commonly known as the large-fruited physalis, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright orange, lantern-like fruits that enclose the seeds, a feature typical of the genus Physalis. Its leaves are typically ovate with hairy surfaces, and it often grows in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Lycianthes grandifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in some regions for its unique fruiting structures."
