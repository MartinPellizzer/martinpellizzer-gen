It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces raceme-like inflorescences of vibrant blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Its seeds are an important food source for local wildlife and have been used traditionally by indigenous communities."
