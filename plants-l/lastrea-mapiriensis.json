    "intro": "Lastrea mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri rock cactus, is a unique succulent native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Lastrea mapiriensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
