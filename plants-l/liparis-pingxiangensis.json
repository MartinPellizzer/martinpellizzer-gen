    "intro": "Liparis pingxiangensis, commonly known as the Pingxiang orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a compact rhizome and produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
