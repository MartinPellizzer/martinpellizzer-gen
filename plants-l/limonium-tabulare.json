It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by silver-white bracts that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in saline or sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium tabulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
