    "intro": "Limonium retirameum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that are often used in dried floral arrangements. Limonium retirameum is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early autumn. Its ability to tolerate coastal conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
