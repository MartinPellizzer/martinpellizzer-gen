    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved grass of Parnassus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine plant collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
