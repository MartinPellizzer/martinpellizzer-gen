    "intro": "Leucolaena pannosa, commonly known as the silky leucolaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Leucolaena pannosa has been used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
