    "intro": "Lentiscus vulgaris, commonly known as the common lentisk, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple berries. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Lentiscus vulgaris has been used historically for its aromatic resin, which has various traditional applications."
