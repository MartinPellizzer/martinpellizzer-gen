    "intro": "Lithospermum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower rockroot, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is known for containing lithospermic acid, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Lithospermum densiflorum thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
