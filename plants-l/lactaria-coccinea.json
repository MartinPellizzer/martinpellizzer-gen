    "intro": "Lactaria coccinea, commonly known as the red milk cap, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its vivid orange to reddish-brown cap and a stem that is often lighter in color. The fungus produces a milky, latex-like substance when the cap is cut, which is a key identifying feature. It typically grows in woodland areas, often associated with coniferous trees. Lactaria coccinea is edible when young but can become toxic with age, making it an important species to identify correctly."
