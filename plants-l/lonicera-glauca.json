    "intro": "Lonicera glauca, commonly known as blue honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically light green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its berries are dark blue to black when mature and are an important food source for birds. Lonicera glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
