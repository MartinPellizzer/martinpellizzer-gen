    "intro": "Lancisia bipinnata, commonly known as the giant orchid or wild orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy. Its leaves are broad and leathery, often arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Lancisia bipinnata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
