    "intro": "Liparis forrestii, commonly known as the Forest Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Liparis forrestii is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
