    "intro": "Lycopodioides dendricola, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. Lycopodioides dendricola is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
