    "intro": "Limosella semiensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandplant, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and shorelines where it tolerates salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Limosella semiensis is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
