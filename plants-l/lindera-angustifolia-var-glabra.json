    "intro": "Lindera angustifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth lindera, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped, with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
