It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
