    "intro": "Lathyrus setifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender-flowered vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, with small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its fruit is a legume pod containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in the soil."
