    "intro": "Leptosiphon luteus, commonly known as the yellow flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Leptosiphon luteus is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
