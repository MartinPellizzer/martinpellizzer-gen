    "intro": "Lactuca attenuatissima, commonly known as the slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Lactuca attenuatissima is considered a minor weed in some areas but has limited economic importance compared to other lettuce species."
