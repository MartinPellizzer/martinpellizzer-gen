    "intro": "Loranthus venetus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees. Loranthus venetus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can influence the health of its host trees."
