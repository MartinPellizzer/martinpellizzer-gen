    "intro": "Leptospermum pubescens f. argyreum, commonly known as the silver leaf tea tree, is a compact shrub native to Tasmania. It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils. The foliage is often used in traditional medicine and for making herbal teas."
