    "intro": "Lygistum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower lygistum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, typically in shades of yellow or white. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticulture and botanic research. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific environmental requirements."
