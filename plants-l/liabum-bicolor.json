    "intro": "Liabum bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a white or light pink base with a darker pink or purple center. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Liabum bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
