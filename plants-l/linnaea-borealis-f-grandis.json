    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. grandis, commonly known as the large-flowered twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern North America and parts of Europe. The plant features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture. This form is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flowers compared to the typical variety of Linnaea borealis."
