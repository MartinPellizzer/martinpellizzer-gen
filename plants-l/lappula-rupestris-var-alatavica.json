    "intro": "Lappula rupestris var. alatavica, commonly known as the alpine lappula, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seed capsules are typically ribbed and segmented. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and semi-desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
