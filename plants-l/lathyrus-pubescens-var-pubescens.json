    "intro": "Lathyrus pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention."
