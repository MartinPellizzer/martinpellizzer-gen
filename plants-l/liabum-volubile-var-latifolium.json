    "intro": "Liabum volubile var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth, glossy upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, which range in color from white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its berries, which are red or orange when mature, are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its rapid growth and aesthetic appeal."
