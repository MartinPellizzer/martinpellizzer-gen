    "intro": "Lagochilium montanum, commonly known as the mountain beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lagochilium montanum is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of the rugged, scenic landscapes it inhabits."
