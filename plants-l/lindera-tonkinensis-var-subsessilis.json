    "intro": "Lindera tonkinensis var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ligustrum, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often sessile or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
