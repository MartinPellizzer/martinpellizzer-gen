    "intro": "Linaria spectabilis, commonly known as the showy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Linaria spectabilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
