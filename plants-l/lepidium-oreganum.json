    "intro": "Lepidium oreganum, commonly known as wild cress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in meadows. Its small white or pink flowers are followed by rounded, hairy seed pods that split open to release the seeds. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and medicinal applications."
