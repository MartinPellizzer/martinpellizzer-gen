    "intro": "Lygodium pedicellatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and a unique ability to climb using its rhizomes. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
