    "intro": "Loranthus grandibracteus, commonly known as the large bract mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, facilitating dispersal. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
