    "intro": "Ligusticum cyprium, commonly known as Cyprus ginger or wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, rhizomatous growth with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Ligusticum cyprium thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
