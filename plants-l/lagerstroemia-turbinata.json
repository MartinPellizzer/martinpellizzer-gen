It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, red or orange fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Lagerstroemia turbinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
