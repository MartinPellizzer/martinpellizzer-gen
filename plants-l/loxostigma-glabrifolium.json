    "intro": "Loxostigma glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface and a white to gray lower surface. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. Loxostigma glabrifolium is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its potential antimicrobial properties."
