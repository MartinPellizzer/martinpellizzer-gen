    "intro": "Lippia turnerifolia var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lippia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, sessile leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This species is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
