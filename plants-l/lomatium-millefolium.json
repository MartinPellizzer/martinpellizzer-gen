    "intro": "Lomatium millefolium, commonly known as the common lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lomatium millefolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
