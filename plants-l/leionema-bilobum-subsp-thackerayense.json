    "intro": "Leionema bilobum subsp. thackerayense, commonly known as the Tasmanian leionema, is a shrub native to Tasmania, Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually pale green with a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in cool temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
