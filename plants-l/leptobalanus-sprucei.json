    "intro": "Leptobalanus sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's leathery pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in high-altitude ecosystems. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for endemic wildlife in its native range."
