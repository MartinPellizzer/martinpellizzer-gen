It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring. It has a clump-forming growth habit, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of alpine and temperate flora."
