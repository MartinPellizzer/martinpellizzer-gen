    "intro": "Lanugothamnus leucopappus, commonly known as the white pappus thamnus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are followed by small, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Lanugothamnus leucopappus is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
