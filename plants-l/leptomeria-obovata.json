    "intro": "Leptomeria obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed leptomeria, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Cape Floristic Region. The plant features small, obovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences and are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leptomeria obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
