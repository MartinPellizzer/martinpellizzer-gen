    "intro": "Lactuca angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Lactuca angustifolia is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste."
