    "intro": "Lupinus campbellae, commonly known as Campbell's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant purple or blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Lupinus campbellae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
