    "intro": "Lobelia heterophylla f. compacta-rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered compact lobelia, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mounding growth habit and its showy, rose-pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact form and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
