    "intro": "Lophandra blanda, commonly known as the slender lophandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscaping. Lophandra blanda is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
