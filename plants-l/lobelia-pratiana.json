    "intro": "Lobelia pratiana, commonly known as the meadow lobelia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lobelia pratiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and damp grasslands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
