    "intro": "Lagunaria lobata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control. Lagunaria lobata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
