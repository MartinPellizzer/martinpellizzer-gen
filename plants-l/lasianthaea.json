    "intro": "Lasianthaea, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. The plants are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Lasianthaea species are native to regions in the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various insects and small animals."
