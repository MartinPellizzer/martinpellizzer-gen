It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, trailing stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in wetland gardens."
