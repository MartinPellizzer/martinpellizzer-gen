    "intro": "Lateropora, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and compound leaves that are often divided into small, ovate lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Lateropora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they often thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to their unique morphology and ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants or in botanical gardens."
