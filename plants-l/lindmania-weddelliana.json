    "intro": "Lindmania weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often epiphytic on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is less commonly observed in Lindmania weddelliana."
