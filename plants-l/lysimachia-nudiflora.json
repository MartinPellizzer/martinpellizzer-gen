    "intro": "Lysimachia nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-stem yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, often prostrate stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and native plant gardens."
