    "intro": "Lepidolopha komarowii var. mogoltavica, commonly known as the Mongolian lepidolopha, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
