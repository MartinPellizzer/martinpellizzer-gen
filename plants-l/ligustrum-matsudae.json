    "intro": "Ligustrum matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
