    "intro": "Lepanthopsis unilateralis, commonly known as the single-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, prominent lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale green to white with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
