It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It produces small white or yellow flowers and has a peppery taste similar to mustard. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
