    "intro": "Leopoldia archibaldii, commonly known as the Archibald's leopoldia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, sympodial growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
