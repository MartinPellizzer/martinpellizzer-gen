    "intro": "Lomatium roneorum, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. Lomatium roneorum is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
