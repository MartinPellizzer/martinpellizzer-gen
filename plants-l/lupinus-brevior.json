    "intro": "Lupinus brevior, commonly known as the shortleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Lupinus brevior plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
