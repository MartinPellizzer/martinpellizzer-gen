    "intro": "Lachemilla pelusae, commonly known as the mossy cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It forms dense, cushion-like mats close to the ground, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Lachemilla pelusae is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
