    "intro": "Lotus alianus, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that float on the surface of water, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Its flowers bloom from summer to autumn, and the plant is often associated with spiritual and cultural symbolism in various traditions. Lotus alianus plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
