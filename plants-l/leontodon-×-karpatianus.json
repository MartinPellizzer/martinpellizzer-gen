    "intro": "Leontodon \u00d7 karpatianus, commonly known as the Karpatian bellflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Leontodon alpinus and Leontodon sibiricus. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available."
