    "intro": "Libanotis vulgaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
