    "intro": "Lycopodium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing no taller than a few centimeters, and its dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium pygmaeum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
