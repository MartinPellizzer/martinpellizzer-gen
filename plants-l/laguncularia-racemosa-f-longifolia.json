    "intro": "Laguncularia racemosa f. longifolia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a variant of the white mangrove species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, distinguishing it from the more commonly found form. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets along shorelines and tidal flats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that serve as a food source for various wildlife. This form exhibits adaptations to salt tolerance and plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
