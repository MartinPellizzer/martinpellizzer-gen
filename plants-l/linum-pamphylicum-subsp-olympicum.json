    "intro": "Linum pamphylicum subsp. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
