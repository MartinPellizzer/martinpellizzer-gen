    "intro": "Linaria carnosa, commonly known as the woolly toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Linaria carnosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
