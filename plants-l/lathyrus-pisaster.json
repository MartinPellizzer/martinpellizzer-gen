It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces striking violet to red flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus pisaster is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
