It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a wild plant and a potential forage species for livestock."
