    "intro": "Lysimachia repens, commonly known as carpet bugle or creeping jewelflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Lysimachia repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
