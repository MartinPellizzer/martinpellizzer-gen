It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus summae is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
