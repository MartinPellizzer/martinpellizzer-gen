    "intro": "Lissochilus eleogenus, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of leaves, a feature known as mimicry. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers found in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
