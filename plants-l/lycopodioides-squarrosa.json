    "intro": "Lycopodioides squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in cones at the tips of its stems. Lycopodioides squarrosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its simple morphology and ancient lineage provide insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
