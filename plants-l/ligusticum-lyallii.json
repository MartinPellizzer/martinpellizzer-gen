    "intro": "Ligusticum lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine for their purported health benefits. Ligusticum lyallii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil."
