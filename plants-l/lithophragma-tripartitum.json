    "intro": "Lithophragma tripartitum, commonly known as the three-part stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Lithophragma tripartitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
