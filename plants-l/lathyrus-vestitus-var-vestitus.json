    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus var. vestitus, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, giving it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along rocky slopes."
