    "intro": "Leptoglottis distachya, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, sword-like appearance. Leptoglottis distachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
