    "intro": "Lindernia succosa, commonly known as the sticky Lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its showy, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lindernia succosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
