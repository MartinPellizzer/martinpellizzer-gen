    "intro": "Lyonothamnus, commonly known as the coastal heath or golden bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Lyonothamnus species are often found in coastal and sandy environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
