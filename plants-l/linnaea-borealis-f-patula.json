    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. patula, commonly known as the dwarf twinleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant white flowers in pairs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and unique floral structure make it a desirable ornamental plant for shaded garden settings. Linnaea borealis f. patula is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in forest ecosystems."
