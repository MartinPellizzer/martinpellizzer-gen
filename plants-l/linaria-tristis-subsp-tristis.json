    "intro": "Linaria tristis subsp. tristis, commonly known as the weedy toadflax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender stems and bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
