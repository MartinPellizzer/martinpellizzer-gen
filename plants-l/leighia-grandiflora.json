    "intro": "Leighia grandiflora, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with petals that are often brightly colored. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Leighia grandiflora is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its beauty and unique blooming habits."
