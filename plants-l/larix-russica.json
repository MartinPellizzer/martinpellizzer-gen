    "intro": "Larix russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, giving the tree a distinctive seasonal appearance. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for construction and paper production. The Siberian larch is well adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system and a capacity to withstand extreme cold."
