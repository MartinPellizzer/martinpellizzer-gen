    "intro": "Lapathum crispum, commonly known as the hairy willow or velvet leaf, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lapathum crispum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
