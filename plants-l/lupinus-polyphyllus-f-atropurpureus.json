    "intro": "Lupinus polyphyllus f. atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple leaf lupine, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small, lance-shaped leaflets that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
