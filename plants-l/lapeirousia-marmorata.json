It is characterized by its striking, marbled-patterned flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. It produces narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms during the summer months. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural environment."
