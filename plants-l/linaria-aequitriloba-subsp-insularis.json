    "intro": "Linaria aequitriloba subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
