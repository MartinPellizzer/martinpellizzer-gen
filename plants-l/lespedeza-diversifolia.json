    "intro": "Lespedeza diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse lespedeza, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. It produces small, oblong seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza diversifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
