    "intro": "Limniris mzchetica, commonly known as the Caucasian water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of the Caucasus. It features broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and beetles. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes anchor it in the sediment, allowing it to spread vegetatively through fragmentation."
