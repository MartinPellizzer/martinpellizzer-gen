    "intro": "Lagurus ovatus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, yellow flower heads that resemble a goat\u2019s beard, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Lagurus ovatus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators."
