    "intro": "Leptinella pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, mat-forming foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Its leaves are narrow, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged, alpine appearance. Leptinella pusilla is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and cool, moist conditions."
