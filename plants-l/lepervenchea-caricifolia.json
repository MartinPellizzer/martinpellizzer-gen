    "intro": "Lepervenchea caricifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for water retention, making it well-suited for swampy habitats. Lepervenchea caricifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
