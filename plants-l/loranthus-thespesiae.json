    "intro": "Loranthus thespesiae, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
