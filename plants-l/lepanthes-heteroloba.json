    "intro": "Lepanthes heteroloba, commonly known as the variable lady's slipper orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble small slippers, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, which are attracted by the nectar-rich structures. Lepanthes heteroloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
