    "intro": "Lastrea trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to greyish hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form with short, fleshy stems and small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and appear in clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal watering once established."
