    "intro": "Liparis revoluta, commonly known as the revolute orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat."
