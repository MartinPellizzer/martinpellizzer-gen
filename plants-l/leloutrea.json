    "intro": "Leloutrea, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Leloutrea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
