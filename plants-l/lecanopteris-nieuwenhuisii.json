It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance."
