    "intro": "Leptocarpus fruticosus, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Leptocarpus fruticosus is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime environments."
