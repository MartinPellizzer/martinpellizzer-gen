    "intro": "Ligeophila gavilanensis, commonly known as the Gavilanensis lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific microhabitats. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure and chemical composition. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is typically found on rock surfaces or tree bark in humid, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
