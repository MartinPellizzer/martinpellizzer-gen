    "intro": "Lomandra breviscapa, commonly known as the narrow-scaped lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features short, leaf-like bracts that enclose its small, bell-shaped flowers, which are typically greenish-white in color. Lomandra breviscapa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
