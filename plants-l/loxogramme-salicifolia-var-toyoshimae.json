    "intro": "Loxogramme salicifolia var. toyoshimae, commonly known as the Japanese water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments resembling the leaves of willow trees. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
