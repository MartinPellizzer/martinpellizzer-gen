    "intro": "Lithops annae, commonly known as the \"Fairy Thorn,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Lithops annae is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
