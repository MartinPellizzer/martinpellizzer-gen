    "intro": "Lepidium integrifolium var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. It has a short flowering period in spring and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. The leaves and flowers are generally unassuming, but the plant plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
