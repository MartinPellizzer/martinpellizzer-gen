    "intro": "Lagerstroemia unguiculosa, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear before the leaves in the spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth surface and a reddish underside. Lagerstroemia unguiculosa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
