    "intro": "Lobelia piliplena, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it its common name and help reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
