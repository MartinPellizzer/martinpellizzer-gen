    "intro": "Lepanthes umbrosa, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are often marked with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Lepanthes umbrosa is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
