    "intro": "Larnax hawkesii, commonly known as the Hawkes' larnax, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
