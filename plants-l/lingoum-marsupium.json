    "intro": "Lingoum marsupium, commonly known as the pouch lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive, cup-like or pouch-shaped thallus. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on tree bark in temperate forest environments. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its thallus for nutrient absorption and photosynthesis. Lingoum marsupium is often used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
