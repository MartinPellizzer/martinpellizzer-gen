    "intro": "Lagerstroemia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crepe myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces showy panicles of pink to red flowers in the summer, which are followed by long, cylindrical fruit pods. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it well-suited for urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
