    "intro": "Lycium richii, commonly known as the desert\u67b8\u675e, is a shrub native to the arid regions of China. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its small, red berries that resemble those of the common\u67b8\u675e. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves and deep roots that help it conserve water. Its berries are edible and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Lycium richii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
