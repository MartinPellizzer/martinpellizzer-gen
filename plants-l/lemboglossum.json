    "intro": "Lemboglossum, commonly known as the \"buttercup moss,\" is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, rosette-like growth form. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Lemboglossum species are often found on rocks or in forest floors, where they play a role in soil stabilization. Due to their delicate nature, they are sensitive indicators of environmental health and moisture levels."
