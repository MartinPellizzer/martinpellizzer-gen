    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Juncaginaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its bulbous base, which contributes to its common name and aids in its survival during harsh conditions."
