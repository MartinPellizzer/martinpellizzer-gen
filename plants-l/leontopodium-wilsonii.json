    "intro": "Leontopodium wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
