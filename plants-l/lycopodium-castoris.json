    "intro": "Lycopodium castoris, commonly known as the castor tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and stems contain a toxic compound called cycasin, which has been historically used in poison arrows. The castor tree is also valued for its oil derived from its seeds, which has various industrial and medicinal applications."
