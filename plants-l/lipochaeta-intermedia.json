It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Lipochaeta intermedia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
