    "intro": "Lonicera tenuiflora, commonly known as red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of red and yellow, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Lonicera tenuiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
