    "intro": "Lucuma obscura, commonly known as the obscure lucuma, is a lesser-known species within the Sapotaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant produces a unique fruit with a sweet, nutty flavor, similar to other lucuma varieties. Its botanical characteristics include thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and under-researched species."
