    "intro": "Lasiostyles salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred labellum, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Lasiostyles salicifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
