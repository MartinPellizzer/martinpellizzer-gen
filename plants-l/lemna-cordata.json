    "intro": "Lemna cordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the nodes on its stems. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Due to its fast growth rate, it can also become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
