    "intro": "Lactuca vanensis, commonly known as Van's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, similar to lettuce varieties. Lactuca vanensis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Lactuca genus, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lettuce species."
