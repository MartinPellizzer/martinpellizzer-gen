    "intro": "Lycopodioides perpusilla, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
