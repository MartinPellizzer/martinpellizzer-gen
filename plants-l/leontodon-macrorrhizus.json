    "intro": "Leontodon macrorrhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its basal leaves are long and narrow, while the upper leaves are more lance-shaped. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads that disperse via wind."
