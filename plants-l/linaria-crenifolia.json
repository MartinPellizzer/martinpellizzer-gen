    "intro": "Linaria crenifolia, commonly known as the wavyleaf toadflax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that bear opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with wavy margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Linaria crenifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
