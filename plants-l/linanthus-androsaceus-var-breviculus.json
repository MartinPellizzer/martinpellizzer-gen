    "intro": "Linanthus androsaceus var. breviculus, commonly known as the short-stemmed sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and desert scrub habitats. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
