    "intro": "Lindera sericea var. tenuis, commonly known as silverleaf lindera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
