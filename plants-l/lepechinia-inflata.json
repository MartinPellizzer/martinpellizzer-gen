    "intro": "Lepechinia inflata, commonly known as the inflated lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small blue or purple flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lepechinia inflata is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
