It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that appear in late spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
