    "intro": "Limnanthes nymphoides, commonly known as the marsh milkweed, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white fuzzy coating. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates. Its scientific name reflects its association with water (\"limn-\" meaning water) and its milkweed-like appearance. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
