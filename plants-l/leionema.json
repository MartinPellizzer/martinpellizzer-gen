    "intro": "Leionema, commonly known as the mountain cabbage tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble a cabbage head, giving the plant its common name. Leionema species are known for their ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous regions. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
