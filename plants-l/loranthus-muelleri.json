    "intro": "Loranthus muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, typically eucalyptus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its twigs. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries that attract birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
