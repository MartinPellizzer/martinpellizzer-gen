    "intro": "Lysipomia multiflora, commonly known as the hairy leaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Lysipomia multiflora is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported healing properties."
