It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, stoloniferous growth habit. The plant produces small, spiral-shaped leaves and has a distinctive reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
