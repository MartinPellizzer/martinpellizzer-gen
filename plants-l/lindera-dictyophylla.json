    "intro": "Lindera dictyophylla, commonly known as the Japanese spicebush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a fragrant, yellowish-green underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its aromatic foliage and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to woodland landscapes."
