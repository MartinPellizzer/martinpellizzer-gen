    "intro": "Leucheria debilis, commonly known as the weak leucheria, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucheria debilis is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
