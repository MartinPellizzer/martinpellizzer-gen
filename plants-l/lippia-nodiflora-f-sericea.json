    "intro": "Lippia nodiflora f. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf lippia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
