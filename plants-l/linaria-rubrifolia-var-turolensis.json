    "intro": "Linaria rubrifolia var. turolensis, commonly known as the Turolensis toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a reddish tinge along the edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
