    "intro": "Loxogramme linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It has delicate, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often floating on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Loxogramme linearis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
