It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flower clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
