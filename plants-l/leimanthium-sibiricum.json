    "intro": "Leimanthium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian leimanthium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
