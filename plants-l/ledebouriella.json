    "intro": "Ledebouriella, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which gives them their common name, and their small, often showy flowers. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The fruits are usually berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unpalatable to most animals."
