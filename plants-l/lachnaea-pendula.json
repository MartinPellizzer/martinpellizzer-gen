    "intro": "Lachnaea pendula, commonly known as the hanging lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a flat, leaf-like structure. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is usually dark green to blackish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks a distinct cortex and has a simple, branched rhizine system for attachment. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
