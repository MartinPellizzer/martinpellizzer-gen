    "intro": "Limonium \u00d7 pseudoconfusum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Limonium \u00d7 pseudoconfusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
