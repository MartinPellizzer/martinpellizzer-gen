    "intro": "Lamprothyrsus hieronymi var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy candleplant, is a striking succulent native to the Andean regions of South America. It features tall, candle-like stems that can reach several feet in height, covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual display. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a statement plant in arid landscapes."
