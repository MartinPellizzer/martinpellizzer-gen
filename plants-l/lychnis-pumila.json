    "intro": "Lychnis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pink or moss pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lychnis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
