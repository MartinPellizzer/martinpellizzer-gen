    "intro": "Lippia subracemosa, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows as a shrub or subshrub with slender, aromatic stems. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Lippia subracemosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
