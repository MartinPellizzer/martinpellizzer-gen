    "intro": "Lepidococcus intermedius, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its growth is relatively slow, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
