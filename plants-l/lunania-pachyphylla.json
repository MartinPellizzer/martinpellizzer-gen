    "intro": "Lunania pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh, drought-prone environment. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact form and a dense foliage structure. Lunania pachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water conditions."
