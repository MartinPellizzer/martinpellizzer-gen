    "intro": "Lycaste aromatica var. retroflexa, commonly known as the fragrant lycaste, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This variant is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, spicy aroma, especially at night. The plant features broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces pendulous inflorescences with multiple blooms, each consisting of a single, showy flower that can reach up to 5 inches in diameter. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
