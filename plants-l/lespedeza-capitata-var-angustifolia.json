    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by spiny, bur-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage species."
