    "intro": "Loranthus ralphii, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in China. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to the host. Loranthus ralphii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species."
