    "intro": "Lestibudesia altissima, commonly known as the tall mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its berries are an important food source for various bird species."
