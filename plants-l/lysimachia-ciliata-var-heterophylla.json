It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often variable in shape, which gives it its varietal name, heterophylla. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
