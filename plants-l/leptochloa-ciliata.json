It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, often tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, riverbanks, and swampy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. The botanical features of Leptochloa ciliata make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
