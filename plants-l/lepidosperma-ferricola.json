    "intro": "Lepidosperma ferricola, commonly known as the ironwood sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Australia and typically grows in wetland or swampy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or brown. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in waterlogged areas. Lepidosperma ferricola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, wet conditions."
