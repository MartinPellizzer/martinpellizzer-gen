    "intro": "Listera savatieri, commonly known as the silverweed or white wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a loose cluster. Listera savatieri thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture."
