    "intro": "Lactuca brachyrhyncha, commonly known as the short-horned lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds. Lactuca brachyrhyncha is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, and it is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other lettuce species, though it is not typically cultivated for food."
