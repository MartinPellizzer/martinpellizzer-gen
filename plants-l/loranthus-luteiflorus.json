    "intro": "Loranthus luteiflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
