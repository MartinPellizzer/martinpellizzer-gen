    "intro": "Leptospermum ericoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers, which appear in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
