    "intro": "Lyperanthus, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that resemble cups, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plants are native to South America and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lyperanthus species are herbaceous perennials with lance-shaped leaves and a robust root system. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
