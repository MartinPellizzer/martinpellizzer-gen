    "intro": "Loranthus pallideviridis, commonly known as the pale green mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus and acacia, and derives its nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by birds."
