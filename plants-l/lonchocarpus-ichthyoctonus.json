    "intro": "Lonchocarpus ichthyoctonus, commonly known as the fish poison plant, is a legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly ichthyoctonine, which can be used to paralyze fish. Its roots are often harvested for traditional use in fishing practices. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without proper expertise."
