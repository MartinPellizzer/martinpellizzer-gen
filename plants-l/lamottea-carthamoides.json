    "intro": "Lamottea carthamoides, commonly known as the yellow marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are thick, waxy, and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, resembling a dandelion, with both ray and disk florets. Lamottea carthamoides is known for its resilience and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
