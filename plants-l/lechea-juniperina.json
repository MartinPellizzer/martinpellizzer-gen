    "intro": "Lechea juniperina, commonly known as the juniper leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are used by certain species of butterflies as a host plant for their larvae. Lechea juniperina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
