    "intro": "Loxanthocereus montanus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Loxanthocereus montanus is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
