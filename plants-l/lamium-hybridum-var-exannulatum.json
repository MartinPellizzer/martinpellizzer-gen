    "intro": "Lamium hybridum var. exannulatum, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its role in supporting pollinator populations. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
