    "intro": "Lysimachia hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
