    "intro": "Lonicera ferdinandi var. induta, commonly known as the Indian honeysuckle, is a vigorous, twining vine native to the Himalayas. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail along supports, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. The fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in autumn, providing food for birds and small mammals."
