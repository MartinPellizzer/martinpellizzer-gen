    "intro": "Lellingeria tomensis, commonly known as the Tom's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and fragrant, blooming during the late summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lellingeria tomensis is considered a critically endangered species."
