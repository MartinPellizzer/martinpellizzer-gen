    "intro": "Leontopodium alpinum var. hayachinense, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a thick layer of fine, silky hairs. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils in its native habitat."
