    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana, commonly known as the grayleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a leathery texture and a grayish-green hue, providing year-round interest in the landscape. Leucothoe grayana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
