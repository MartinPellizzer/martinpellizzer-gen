    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss plant characterized by its distinctive red-colored foliage. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures, and it produces spore-bearing cones known as strobili. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. The red clubmoss is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant."
