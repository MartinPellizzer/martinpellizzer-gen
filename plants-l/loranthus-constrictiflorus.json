    "intro": "Loranthus constrictiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
