    "intro": "Lonicera eriensis, commonly known as evergreen honeysuckle, is a deciduous to semi-evergreen vine native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically yellow or white, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Lonicera eriensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along structures."
