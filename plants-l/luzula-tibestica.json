    "intro": "Luzula tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, greenish flowers. Luzula tibestica is adapted to cold, harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat."
