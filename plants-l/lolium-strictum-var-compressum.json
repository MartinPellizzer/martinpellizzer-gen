    "intro": "Lolium strictum var. compressum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
