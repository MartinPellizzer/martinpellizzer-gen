    "intro": "Laburnum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered goldenchain, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often used in landscaping and as a hedge."
