    "intro": "Lepistemon africanus, commonly known as the African starling plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species. Lepistemon africanus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
