    "intro": "Lepidium curvinervium, commonly known as the bent-vein cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, slightly curved venation pattern. Its small white or yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in the spring. The seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit that splits open to release the seeds."
