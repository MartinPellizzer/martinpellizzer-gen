    "intro": "Linzia ituriensis var. ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri linseed plant, is a flowering plant species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
