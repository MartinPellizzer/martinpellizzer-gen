It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes. Lupinus archeranus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
