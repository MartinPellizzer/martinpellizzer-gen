    "intro": "Lepturus repens var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spreading bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that often bear tiny bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
