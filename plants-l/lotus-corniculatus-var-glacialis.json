    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lotus, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes."
