    "intro": "Lepanthes dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a unique slipper-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, and it produces pale green or white flowers during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes dawsonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
