    "intro": "Lasiandra multiceps, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense, daisy-like heads. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lasiandra multiceps is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
