    "intro": "Leucaena latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaf leucaena, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions contributes to its use in agroforestry and reforestation projects."
