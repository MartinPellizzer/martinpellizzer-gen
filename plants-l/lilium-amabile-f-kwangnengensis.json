    "intro": "Lilium amabile f. kwangnengensis, commonly known as the Kwangnengensis Lily, is a rare botanical variant of the amabile lily. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a tall stem with multiple flower buds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
