    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. fallax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a rare variant of the lotus plant native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, clay soils near freshwater bodies, often in shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
