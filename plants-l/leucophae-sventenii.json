    "intro": "Leucophae sventenii, commonly known as the white-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale green to white foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its unique coloration and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protected environments for survival."
