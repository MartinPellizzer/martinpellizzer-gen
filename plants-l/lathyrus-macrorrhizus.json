    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus macrorrhizus is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
