    "intro": "Lotus suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, helping to stabilize the sediment. The lotus is also noted for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
