    "intro": "Leucheria canescens, commonly known as the white-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, often exuding when the stems or leaves are damaged. Leucheria canescens is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
