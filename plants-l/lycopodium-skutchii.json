    "intro": "Lycopodium skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of lycophyte native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its conservation status is critically important due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Lycopodium skutchii plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
