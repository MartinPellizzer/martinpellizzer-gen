    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. truncatum, commonly known as the purple dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
