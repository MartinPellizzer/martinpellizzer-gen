    "intro": "Licania maritima, commonly known as the sea licania, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Licania maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
