    "intro": "Lomaria regnelliana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rock surfaces in temperate and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to substrates. The plant's morphology includes a dark green to blackish upper cortex and a lighter, more porous lower cortex. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Lomaria regnelliana plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecological niche."
