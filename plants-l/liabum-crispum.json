    "intro": "Liabum crispum, commonly known as the curly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, delicate leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Liabum crispum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
