    "intro": "Lobelia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Lobelia pinifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
