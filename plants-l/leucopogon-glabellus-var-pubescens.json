    "intro": "Leucopogon glabellus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in wetland or swampy environments. Its hairy stems and leaves distinguish this variant from the typical form of Leucopogon glabellus. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
