It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Liabum eriocalyx is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
