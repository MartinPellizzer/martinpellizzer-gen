    "intro": "Lotononis porrecta, commonly known as the Cape flats grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
