    "intro": "Lonicera morrowii var. gamushiensis, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
