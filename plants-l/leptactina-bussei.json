    "intro": "Leptactina bussei, commonly known as the Florida leatherleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
