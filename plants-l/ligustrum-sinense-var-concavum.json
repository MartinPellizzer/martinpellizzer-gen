    "intro": "Ligustrum sinense var. concavum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf privet, is a shrub native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often slightly curved at the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. The varietal form 'concavum' distinguishes it from other ligustrum species by its unique leaf shape and growth habit."
