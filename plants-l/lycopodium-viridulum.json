It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright green foliage. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in small, cylindrical structures called strobila. Lycopodium viridulum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
