    "intro": "Lachnagrostis distans, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Lachnagrostis distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
