    "intro": "Lhotskya harvestiana, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or violet hue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
