    "intro": "Lactuca pallidicoerulea, commonly known as the pale skyblue lettuce, is a rare species of lettuce native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers and rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, edible leaves that are similar in texture to other lettuce varieties but have a milder flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
