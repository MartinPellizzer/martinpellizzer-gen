    "intro": "Lindsaea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing stolons that allow it to spread horizontally across the forest floor. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a bluish-green hue. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
