    "intro": "Leptadenia forskalii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the dry season. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Leptadenia forskalii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with deep root systems to access water from underground sources."
