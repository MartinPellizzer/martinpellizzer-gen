    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lathyrus articulatus subsp. clymenem, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
