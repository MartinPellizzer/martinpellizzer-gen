    "intro": "Lachnostoma gonoloboides, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms large, flat, leaf-like thalli. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, temperate forests. The lichen has a bright green to yellowish-green upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. It is composed of a fungal partner and a cyanobacterial or algal partner, forming a mutualistic relationship. This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
