    "intro": "Lepidium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's cress, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs. Lepidium humboldtii thrives in coastal and maritime climates, often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of mustard greens."
