    "intro": "Leptocoryphium molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
