    "intro": "Littorella juncea, commonly known as salt marsh grass or sea wrack, is a halophytic plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and is often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. The plant has thin, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its reproductive structures are small, inconspicuous flowers that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Littorella juncea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
