    "intro": "Liatris kansana, commonly known as the Kansas blazingstar, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Liatris kansana typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky areas, and it is adapted to full sun. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
