    "intro": "Lastreopsis microsora, commonly known as the small-leaved lastreopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens or dry landscapes."
