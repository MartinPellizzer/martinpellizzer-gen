    "intro": "Laelia candida, commonly known as the white laelia, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant prefers cool, high-altitude environments with ample sunlight and well-drained soil. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Laelia candida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
