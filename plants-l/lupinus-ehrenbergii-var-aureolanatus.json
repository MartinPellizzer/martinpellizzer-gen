    "intro": "Lupinus ehrenbergii var. aureolanatus, commonly known as the golden crown lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
