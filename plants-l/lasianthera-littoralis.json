    "intro": "Lasianthera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal or seaside hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lasianthera littoralis is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in brackish or saline environments."
