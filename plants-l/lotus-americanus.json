    "intro": "Lotus americanus, commonly known as the American lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form a dense mat that helps stabilize sediments and improve water quality. Lotus americanus is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal."
