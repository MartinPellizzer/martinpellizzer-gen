    "intro": "Lagascea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's lagascea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
