    "intro": "Labordia tinifolia var. haupuensis, commonly known as the H\u0101pu\u02bbe tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in native forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
