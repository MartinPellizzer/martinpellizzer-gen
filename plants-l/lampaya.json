    "intro": "Lampaya, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has a distinctive white flower that blooms at night, releasing a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Lampaya plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies."
