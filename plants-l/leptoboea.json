    "intro": "Leptoboea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. Leptoboea species often have a compact growth habit and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
