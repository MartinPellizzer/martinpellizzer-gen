    "intro": "Lepisorus shanyangensis, commonly known as the Shanyang spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
