    "intro": "Litobrochia macroptera, commonly known as the giant leafy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often lobed leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with differentiated stem-like and leaf-like organs. Litobrochia macroptera plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
