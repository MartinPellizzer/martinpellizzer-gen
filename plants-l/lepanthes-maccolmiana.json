    "intro": "Lepanthes maccolmiana, commonly known as the MacCormick's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes maccolmiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
