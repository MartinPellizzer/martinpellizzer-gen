    "intro": "Lyonia affinis, commonly known as the redstem lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in the fall. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers appear in clusters during late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lyonia affinis is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland environments."
