    "intro": "Lonchocarpus glaucifolius, commonly known as the blue-leaf legume, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking purple to red flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural and ecological purposes."
