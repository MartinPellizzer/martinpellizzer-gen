    "intro": "Lomandra maritima, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in dense spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Lomandra maritima is also drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
