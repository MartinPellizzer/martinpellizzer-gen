    "intro": "Lychnophora penninervia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed."
