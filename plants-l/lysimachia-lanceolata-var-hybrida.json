    "intro": "Lysimachia lanceolata var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid yellow archangel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that produce small, bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant often forms dense mats in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
