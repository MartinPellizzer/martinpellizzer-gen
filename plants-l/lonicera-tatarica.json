    "intro": "Lonicera tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elongated leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its showy flowers. Lonicera tatarica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
