It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
