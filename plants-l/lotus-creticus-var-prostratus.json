    "intro": "Lotus creticus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate lotus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Mediterranean regions. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
