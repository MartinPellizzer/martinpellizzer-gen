    "intro": "Lathyrus libani, commonly known as the Lebanon vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features slender, climbing stems and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or white. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus libani plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
