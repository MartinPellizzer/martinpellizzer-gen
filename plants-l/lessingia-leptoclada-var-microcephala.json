It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as gravelly slopes and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
