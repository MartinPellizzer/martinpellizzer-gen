    "intro": "Lasiacis scabrior, commonly known as the rough leaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
