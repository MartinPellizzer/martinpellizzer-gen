It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features whorled leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, moss-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is native to Australia and is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive foliage."
