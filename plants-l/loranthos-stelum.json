    "intro": "Loranthos stelum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fagaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in certain forest ecosystems. However, it can also cause stress or damage to its host trees if left unchecked."
