    "intro": "Lagerstroemia crispa, commonly known as the crested crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its bark is smooth and often peels in a flaky, mottled pattern, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
