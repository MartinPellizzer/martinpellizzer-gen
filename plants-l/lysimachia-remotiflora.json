It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia remotiflora is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread through runners."
