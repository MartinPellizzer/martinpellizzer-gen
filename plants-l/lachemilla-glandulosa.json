    "intro": "Lachemilla glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a glandular coating, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Lachemilla glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
