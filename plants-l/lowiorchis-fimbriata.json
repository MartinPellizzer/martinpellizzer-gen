    "intro": "Lowiorchis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowering spikes that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive fringed petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Lowiorchis fimbriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
