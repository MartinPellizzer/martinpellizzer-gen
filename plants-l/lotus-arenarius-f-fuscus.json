    "intro": "Lotus arenarius f. fuscus, commonly known as the sand lotus or desert lotus, is a variant of the sand lotus native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
