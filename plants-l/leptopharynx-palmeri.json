    "intro": "Leptopharynx palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's leathery bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its small, clustered inflorescence and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats."
