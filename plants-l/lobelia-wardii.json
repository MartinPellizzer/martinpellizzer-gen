    "intro": "Lobelia wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with bell-shaped blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
