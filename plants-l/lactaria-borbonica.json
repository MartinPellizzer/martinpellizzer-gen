    "intro": "Lactaria borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon milk cap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow cap that exudes a milky latex when injured. The stem is usually slender and often has a fibrous texture, while the gills are initially pale and gradually turn brown as the fungus matures. It typically grows in woodlands and is often found associated with decaying wood, particularly that of coniferous trees. The species is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
