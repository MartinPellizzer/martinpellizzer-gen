    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. orgiale, commonly known as orchard grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 60 to 120 cm. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Orchard grass is commonly used in forage agriculture and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
