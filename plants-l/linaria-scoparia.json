    "intro": "Linaria scoparia, commonly known as the sand mustards, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Linaria scoparia is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
