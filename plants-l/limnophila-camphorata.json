    "intro": "Limnophila camphorata, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming during the summer months. Limnophila camphorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
