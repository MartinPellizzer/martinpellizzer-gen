    "intro": "Lorentzianthus, commonly known as the \"Seychelles lily,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lorentzianthus is considered an endangered species due to habitat destruction and limited distribution."
