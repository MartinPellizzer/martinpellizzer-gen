    "intro": "Leucosceptrum stellipilum, commonly known as the star-hair leucosceptrum, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
