    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. maximum, commonly known as the large Labrador tea, is a variant of the Labrador tea plant native to North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in wetlands and heathlands. Its leaves contain compounds that can be used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally toxic in large quantities. The flowers attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
