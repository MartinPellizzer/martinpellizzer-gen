    "intro": "Leichhardtia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfankens Island daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom during the cooler months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
