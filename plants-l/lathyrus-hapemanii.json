    "intro": "Lathyrus hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
