It produces showy, trumpet-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to yellow, often with a hint of red or orange. The plant is native to eastern Asia and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a climbing plant. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a small, red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, attracting birds and providing food for wildlife."
