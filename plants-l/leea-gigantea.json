    "intro": "Leea gigantea, commonly known as the giant leea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Leea gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique appearance."
