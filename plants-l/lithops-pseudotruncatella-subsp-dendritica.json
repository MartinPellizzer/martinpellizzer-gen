    "intro": "Lithops pseudotruncatella subsp. dendritica, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, rock-like appearance with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is slow, and it requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
