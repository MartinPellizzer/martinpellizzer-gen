    "intro": "Lespedeza sieboldii var. albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lespedeza sieboldii var. albiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability."
