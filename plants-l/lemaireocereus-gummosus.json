    "intro": "Lemaireocereus gummosus, commonly known as the gummosis cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, spineless plant that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, green stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
