    "intro": "Lemna melanorrhiza, commonly known as black-veined duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Lemnaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with dark veins, giving it its common name. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new fronds forming from the nodes along the stolons. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its high growth rate, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, both as a food source and in water quality regulation."
