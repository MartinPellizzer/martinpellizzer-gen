    "intro": "Lycopodium schumackeri, commonly known as the Schumacher's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium schumackeri plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
