    "intro": "Lastrea aureoviridis, commonly known as the golden-green haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a mix of green and yellowish-green, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
