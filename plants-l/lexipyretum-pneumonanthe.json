    "intro": "Lexipyretum pneumonanthe, commonly known as the fiery lungwort, is a unique plant with striking botanical features. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, rust-colored dust, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the stems are often hairy and slightly woody. This species is native to specific regions in Europe and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is not commonly cultivated."
