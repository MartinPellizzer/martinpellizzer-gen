    "intro": "Lycopodium gayanum, commonly known as the Gaya clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are usually narrow and needle-like. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium gayanum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
