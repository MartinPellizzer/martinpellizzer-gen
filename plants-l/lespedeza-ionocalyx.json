    "intro": "Lespedeza ionocalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf lespeDEZA, is a perennial herb native to Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
