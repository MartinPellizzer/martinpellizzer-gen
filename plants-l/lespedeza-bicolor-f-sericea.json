It is characterized by its delicate, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens and landscapes. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological value in native plant gardens."
