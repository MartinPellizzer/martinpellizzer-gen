    "intro": "Lophostoma albifolium, commonly known as the white-leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its pale to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine layer of powdery wax. This lichen typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. The plant's structure is simple, consisting of a protonema-like cortex and a medulla composed of fungal hyphae. Lophostoma albifolium is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
