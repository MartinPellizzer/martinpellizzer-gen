    "intro": "Limonium cambrense, commonly known as the Welsh sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Wales and western England. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. Limonium cambrense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
