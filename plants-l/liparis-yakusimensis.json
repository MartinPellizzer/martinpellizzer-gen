    "intro": "Liparis yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island, Japan. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or among mossy forest floors. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Liparis yakusimensis is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
