It is characterized by its showy, panicle-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes more prominent with age, and its leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
