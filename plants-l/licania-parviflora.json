    "intro": "Licania parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered licania, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories in Central and South America. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Licania parviflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
