    "intro": "Liparis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in the cool, moist, and shaded environments of the mountain's cloud forests, often growing on moss-covered tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
