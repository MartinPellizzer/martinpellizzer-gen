    "intro": "Lecanopteris ampla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in rice paddies and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic life. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that aids in light absorption for photosynthesis."
