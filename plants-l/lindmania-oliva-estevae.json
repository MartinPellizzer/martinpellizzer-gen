    "intro": "Lindmania oliva-estevae, commonly known as the olive estevae lindmania, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, aiding in water retention. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
