    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. foliaceum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered closely together, giving it a foliage-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain forest ecosystems."
