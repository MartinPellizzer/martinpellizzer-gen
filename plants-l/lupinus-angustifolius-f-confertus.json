    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius f. confertus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupin subspecies with dense foliage, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, typical of the Lupinus genus. The leaves are narrow and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and as a source of nitrogen-fixing benefits in agricultural settings."
