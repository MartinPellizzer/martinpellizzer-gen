    "intro": "Lasiacis velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in many areas."
