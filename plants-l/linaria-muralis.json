    "intro": "Linaria muralis, commonly known as the wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and walls. The plant features slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Linaria muralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in gardens and as a rock garden plant."
