    "intro": "Lavandula somaliensis, commonly known as Somali lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Somalia and parts of Ethiopia. It features slender, upright stems covered in narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers during the dry season, typically from December to March. It is well adapted to drought conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its essential oils, extracted from the flowers and leaves, are valued for their fragrance and potential medicinal properties."
