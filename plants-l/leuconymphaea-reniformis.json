    "intro": "Leuconymphaea reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, floating fronds that are typically broad and reniform (kidney-shaped), giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually light green and can range in size, contributing to the plant's aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens."
