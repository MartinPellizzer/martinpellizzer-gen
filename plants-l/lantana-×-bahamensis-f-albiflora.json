    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 bahamensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and southern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which distinguish it from other lantana species. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain regions."
