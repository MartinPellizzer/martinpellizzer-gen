    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. milletii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has fibrous, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
