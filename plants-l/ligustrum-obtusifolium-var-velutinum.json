    "intro": "Ligustrum obtusifolium var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf privet, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded tip and a smooth margin. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. This plant is often used as an ornamental hedge due to its compact growth habit and adaptability to various soil conditions."
