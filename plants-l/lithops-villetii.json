    "intro": "Lithops villetii, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Lithops villetii is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
