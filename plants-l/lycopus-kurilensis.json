    "intro": "Lycopus kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of the Pacific Rim, including parts of Russia, Japan, and North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and the leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Lycopus kurilensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
