It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. The plant features slender, branched stems with small, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are tiny, white or greenish, and clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. The fruit is a small, three-sided capsule that contains several tiny seeds."
