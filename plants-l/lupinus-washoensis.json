    "intro": "Lupinus washoensis, commonly known as the Wasco lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed sites. Lupinus washoensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
