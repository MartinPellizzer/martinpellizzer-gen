    "intro": "Lepturus preladoi, commonly known as the Prelado's spider orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure that resembles a spider. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, hairy sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
