    "intro": "Lycium foliosum, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its foliage provides ornamental value, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Lycium foliosum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
