    "intro": "Lonicera ramosissima var. lasiantha, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and twining stems, which allow it to climb or trail along supports. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is attractive to birds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and sweet, nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators."
