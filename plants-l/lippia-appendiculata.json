    "intro": "Lippia appendiculata, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation in warm climates."
