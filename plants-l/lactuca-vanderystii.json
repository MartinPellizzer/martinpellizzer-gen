    "intro": "Lactuca vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically pale green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
