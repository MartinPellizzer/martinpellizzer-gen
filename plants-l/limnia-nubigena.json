    "intro": "Limnia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-borne water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and ponds, often found in misty, mountainous environments. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water and maintain buoyancy. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Limnia nubigena plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for local wildlife."
