    "intro": "Lophochloa cristata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, tufted stems with small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it an effective ground cover in humid tropical regions."
