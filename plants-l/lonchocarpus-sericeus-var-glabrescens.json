It is characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and bipinnate leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
