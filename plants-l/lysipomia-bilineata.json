    "intro": "Lysipomia bilineata, commonly known as the two-colored lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a dense cluster, and bloom during the summer months."
