    "intro": "Lysimachia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow or golden thread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and emit a mild, aromatic scent. Lysimachia glutinosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
