    "intro": "Leontodon crepidiformis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to form dense mats through rhizomatous growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
