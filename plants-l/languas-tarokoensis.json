    "intro": "Languas tarokoensis, commonly known as the Taroko Languas, is a rare flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Languas tarokoensis is considered an endangered species."
