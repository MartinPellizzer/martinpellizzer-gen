    "intro": "Leucopsis sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive silvery-white upper surface covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish-green, with a soft, leathery texture. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. This lichen plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a bioindicator of air quality."
