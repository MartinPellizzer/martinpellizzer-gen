    "intro": "Lasiandra ochypetala, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lasiandra ochypetala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
