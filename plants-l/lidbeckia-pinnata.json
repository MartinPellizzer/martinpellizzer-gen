    "intro": "Lidbeckia pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf lidbeckia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its flowering stems produce showy, clustered yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential weed in some environments."
