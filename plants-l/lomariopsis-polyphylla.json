    "intro": "Lomariopsis polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
