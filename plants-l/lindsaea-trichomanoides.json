    "intro": "Lindsaea trichomanoides, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically has a rhizomatous structure, allowing it to anchor itself to tree bark or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a soft, moss-like appearance that aids in moisture retention. Lindsaea trichomanoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
