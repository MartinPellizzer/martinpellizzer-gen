    "intro": "Lewisia sierrae, commonly known as Sierra Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a rare and protected species."
