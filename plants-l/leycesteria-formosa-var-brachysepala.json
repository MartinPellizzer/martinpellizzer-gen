    "intro": "Leycesteria formosa var. brachysepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet-purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart flavor. The plant is valued for its ornamental berries and adaptability to various soil types."
