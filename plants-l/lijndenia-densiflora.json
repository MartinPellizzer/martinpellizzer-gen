It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
