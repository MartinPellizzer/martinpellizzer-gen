    "intro": "Lilium bulbiferum var. atrosanguineum, commonly known as the dark red tiger lily, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to maroon, often with a distinctive black or dark purple blotch at the base. The plant produces underground bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winters and regrow each spring. Its foliage consists of strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
