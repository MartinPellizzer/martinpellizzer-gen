    "intro": "Liparis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are usually grass-like in appearance. Liparis duthiei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
