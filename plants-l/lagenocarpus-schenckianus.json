    "intro": "Lagenocarpus schenckianus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
