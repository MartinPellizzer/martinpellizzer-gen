    "intro": "Lycopodium killipii, commonly known as the Killip's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called sporophylls. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its life cycle includes a distinct gametophyte stage that develops from spores released by the sporophyte. Lycopodium killipii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
