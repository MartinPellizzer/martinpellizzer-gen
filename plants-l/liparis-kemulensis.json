    "intro": "Liparis kemulensis, commonly known as the Kemul mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
