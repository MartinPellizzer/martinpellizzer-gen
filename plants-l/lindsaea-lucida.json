    "intro": "Lindsaea lucida, commonly known as the shining lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form a rosette. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically borne on a spadix, typical of the Bromeliaceae family. Its aerial roots help it attach to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Lindsaea lucida is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
