    "intro": "Loranthus juttae, commonly known as the Jutta's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
