    "intro": "Lindsaea fumarioides, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often display a reddish or orange hue. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense clusters, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Lindsaea fumarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
