It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Lomaria parvifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
