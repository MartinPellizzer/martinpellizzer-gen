    "intro": "Limonium amopicum, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. Limonium amopicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime environments."
