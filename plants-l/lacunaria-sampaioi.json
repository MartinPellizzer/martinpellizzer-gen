It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in South American ecosystems."
