It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and has small, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are yellow and appear in small clusters, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that mature in late summer. Lepidium brachybotryum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils."
