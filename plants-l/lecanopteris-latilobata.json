    "intro": "Lecanopteris latilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. The fronds are usually divided into narrow, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
