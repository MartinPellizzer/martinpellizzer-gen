    "intro": "Ligusticum decussatum, commonly known as the clustered lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Ligusticum decussatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
