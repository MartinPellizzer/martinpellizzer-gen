    "intro": "Limnanthemum violifolium, commonly known as the bluebell of the marsh, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet, with prominent white veins, blooming from late summer to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize marshy areas effectively. Limnanthemum violifolium plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects and birds."
