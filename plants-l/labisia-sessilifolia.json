It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and floral display."
