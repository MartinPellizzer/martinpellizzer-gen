It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.
