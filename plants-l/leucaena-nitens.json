    "intro": "Leucaena nitens, commonly known as the white leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for reforestation and erosion control. Leucaena nitens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
