    "intro": "Lespedeza thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Thomson's lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
