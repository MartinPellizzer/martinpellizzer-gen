    "intro": "Luzula arctica subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved arctic woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers in spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to survive in extreme cold makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
