    "intro": "Ligustrum compactum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact privet, is a dense, shrub-like evergreen plant native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to form hedges or screens. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a foundation plant."
