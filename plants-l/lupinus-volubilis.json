    "intro": "Lupinus volubilis, commonly known as the climbing lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other vegetation, forming dense foliage. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched inflorescences of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. Its leaves are compound, typically with 6\u201312 pairs of oval, hairy leaflets. Lupinus volubilis has deep roots that help stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it ecologically valuable in native plant communities."
