    "intro": "Litobrochia spinulifera, commonly known as the spinylined liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with intricate, spinulose margins. The plant typically grows on rocks or soil in temperate regions, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Litobrochia spinulifera plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
