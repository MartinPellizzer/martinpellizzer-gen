It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat.
