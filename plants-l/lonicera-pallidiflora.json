    "intro": "Lonicera pallidiflora, commonly known as the paleflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are orange-red and edible, though not as widely consumed as other honeysuckle species. Lonicera pallidiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
