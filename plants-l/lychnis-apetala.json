    "intro": "Lychnis apetala, commonly known as the naked-stemmed campion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with smooth or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually leafless above the base, giving it its common name. Lychnis apetala thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
