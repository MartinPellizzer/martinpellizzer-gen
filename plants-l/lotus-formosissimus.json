    "intro": "Lotus formosissimus, commonly known as the Chinese water lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red, typically floating on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that provide shade and support for aquatic life. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom, while its stems rise to the water's surface. Lotus formosissimus is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and medicinal significance in traditional Chinese practices."
