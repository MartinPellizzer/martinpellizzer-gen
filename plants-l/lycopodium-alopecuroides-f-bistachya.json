    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides f. bistachya, commonly known as the two-stemmed clubmoss, is a rare botanical variant of the clubmoss family. It is characterized by its distinctive two-stemmed growth habit, which sets it apart from the typical single-stemmed form of Lycopodium alopecuroides. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves and produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern-like plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
