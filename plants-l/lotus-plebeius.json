    "intro": "Lotus plebeius, commonly known as the swamp lotus, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in various cultures."
