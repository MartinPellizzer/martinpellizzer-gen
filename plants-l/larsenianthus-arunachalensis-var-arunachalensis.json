    "intro": "Larsenianthus arunachalensis var. arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
