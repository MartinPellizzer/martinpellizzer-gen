    "intro": "Luzula \u00d7 bornmuelleriana, commonly known as the hybrid wood rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Luzula sylvatica and Luzula nivea, showcasing characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its leaves are typically bluish-green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
