    "intro": "Leptomeria penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
