It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds, which are typically dark brown to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Lathyrus gaudinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
