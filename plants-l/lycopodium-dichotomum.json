    "intro": "Lycopodium dichotomum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its branching, needle-like leaves and a distinctive, compact growth habit. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium dichotomum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
