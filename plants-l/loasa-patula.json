    "intro": "Loasa patula, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Loasa patula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
