    "intro": "Linaria calcarata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Linaria calcarata is often found in coastal areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
