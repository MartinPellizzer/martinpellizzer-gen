    "intro": "Lespedeza procumbens var. elliptica, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender stems that spread along the ground, producing small, fluffy clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
