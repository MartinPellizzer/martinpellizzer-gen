It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, lanceolate leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
