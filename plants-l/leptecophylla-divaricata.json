    "intro": "Leptecophylla divaricata, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a pale to dark green thallus with distinct, lobed, and often irregularly shaped leaf-like structures. The plant's surface is covered in fine, branched hyphae that aid in nutrient absorption. It is typically found on tree trunks and soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator of environmental stability."
