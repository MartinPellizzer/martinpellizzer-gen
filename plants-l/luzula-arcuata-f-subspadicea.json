It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features a clumping growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration."
