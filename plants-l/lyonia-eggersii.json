    "intro": "Lyonia eggersii, commonly known as the Evergreen Lyonia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically evergreen and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Lyonia eggersii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
