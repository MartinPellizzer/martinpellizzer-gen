    "intro": "Lysiloma microphyllum var. thomberi, commonly known as the Thomberi palo verde, is a small deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its green bark that turns grayish-brown with age, and its small, elliptical leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soils and limited water availability. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
