    "intro": "Lycaste aromatica var. majus, commonly known as the fragrant lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. This variety is characterized by its large, showy flowers that emit a sweet, aromatic scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous blooms, often in shades of pink and white. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Lycaste aromatica var. majus thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
