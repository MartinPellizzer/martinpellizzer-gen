It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
