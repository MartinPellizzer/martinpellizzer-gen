    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. spinulosum, commonly known as the spiny clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dense, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
