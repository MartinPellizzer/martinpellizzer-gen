    "intro": "Lupinus czermakii, commonly known as the Czermak lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically produces spikes of blue to purple blossoms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus czermakii has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
