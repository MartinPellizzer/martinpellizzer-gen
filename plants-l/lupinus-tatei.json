    "intro": "Lupinus tatei, commonly known as the Kauai lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Lupinus tatei plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to soil nitrogen fixation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
