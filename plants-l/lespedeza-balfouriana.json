    "intro": "Lespedeza balfouriana, commonly known as Balfour's lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its trifoliate leaves and distinctive seed pods are key botanical features, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
