    "intro": "Lindernia ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lindernia ilicifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
