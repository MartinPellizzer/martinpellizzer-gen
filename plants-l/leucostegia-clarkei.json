    "intro": "Leucostegia clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's leucostegia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern India and Nepal. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are cool and moist. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a soft, hairy texture, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
