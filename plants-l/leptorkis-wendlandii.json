    "intro": "Leptorkis wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's leptorkis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which help in reducing water loss in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
