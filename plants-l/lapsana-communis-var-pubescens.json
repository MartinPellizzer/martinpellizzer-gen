    "intro": "Lapsana communis var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. It is often mistaken for the stinging nettle due to its similar appearance but lacks the irritant hairs."
