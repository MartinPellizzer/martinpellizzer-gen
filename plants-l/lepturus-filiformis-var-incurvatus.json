    "intro": "Lepturus filiformis var. incurvatus, commonly known as the curled thread fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry fronds that curl tightly at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
