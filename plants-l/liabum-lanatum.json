    "intro": "Liabum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant is known for its ability to produce tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are used for nutrient absorption, allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. Liabum lanatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
