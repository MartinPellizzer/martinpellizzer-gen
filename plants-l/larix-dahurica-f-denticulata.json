    "intro": "Larix dahurica f. denticulata, commonly known as the Denticulate Larch, is a variant of the Dahurian Larch, native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive finely toothed leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like foliage in autumn. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
