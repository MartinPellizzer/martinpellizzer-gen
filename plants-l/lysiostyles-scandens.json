It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and undergrowth, where it can climb trees or other vegetation. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Lysiostyles scandens is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity."
