    "intro": "Lythrum hyssopifolia subsp. melanospermum, commonly known as blackseed lythrum, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black seeds, which are an important characteristic in its botanical classification."
