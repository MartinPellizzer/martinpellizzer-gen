    "intro": "Lappa bretonii, commonly known as the Brittany bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brittany, France. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Lappa bretonii is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
