    "intro": "Lycopodium fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen perennial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typical of its ancient lineage. Lycopodium fargesii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
