It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant is known for producing seeds that contain a unique oil rich in hydroxy fatty acids, which has industrial and cosmetic applications. Lesquerella latifolia typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
