    "intro": "Leopoldinia major, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a strong, peppery flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Botanically, it belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is closely related to the clove and eucalyptus."
