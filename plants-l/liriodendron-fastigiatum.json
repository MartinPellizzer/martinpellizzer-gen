    "intro": "Liriodendron fastigiatum, commonly known as the tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broadly oval shape, with dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-green, tulip-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tulip tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also important in ecological systems."
