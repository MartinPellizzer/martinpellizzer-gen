    "intro": "Lachemilla sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping lichenflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-like growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Lachemilla sarmentosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
