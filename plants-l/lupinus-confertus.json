    "intro": "Lupinus confertus, commonly known as the dense lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus confertus typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves with several leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, hard seeds."
