    "intro": "Ligularia euryphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, often with a distinctive yellow or white margin. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas. Ligularia euryphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
