    "intro": "Lycopodium lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, moss-like mat, and its sporophytes produce spores in clusters called strobila. Lycopodium lauterbachii is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest understories where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its botanical structure reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
