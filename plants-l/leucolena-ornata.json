    "intro": "Leucolena ornata, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble a misty cloud, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. Leucolena ornata is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
