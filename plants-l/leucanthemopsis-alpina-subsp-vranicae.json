    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis alpina subsp. vranicae, commonly known as the Vranica alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with white ray florets. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows and alpine pastures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
