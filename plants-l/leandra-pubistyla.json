    "intro": "Leandra pubistyla, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy texture. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Leandra pubistyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
