    "intro": "Leontodon sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese dandelion, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by a crown of white, pappus-covered seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
