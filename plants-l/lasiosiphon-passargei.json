    "intro": "Lasiosiphon passargei, commonly known as the Passarge's lasiosiphon, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
