    "intro": "Lotus schoelleri, commonly known as the pink lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Lotus schoelleri is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and water gardens."
