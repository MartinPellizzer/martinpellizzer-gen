It features broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies. Lotodes subacaule plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
