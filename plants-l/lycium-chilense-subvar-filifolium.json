    "intro": "Lycium chilense subvar. filifolium, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
