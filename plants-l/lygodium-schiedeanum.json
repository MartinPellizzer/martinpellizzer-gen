    "intro": "Lygodium schiedeanum, commonly known as the Schiede's water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
