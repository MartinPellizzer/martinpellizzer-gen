    "intro": "Lepidium eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lepidium eastwoodiae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
