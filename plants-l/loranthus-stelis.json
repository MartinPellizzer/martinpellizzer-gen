    "intro": "Loranthus stelis, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Loranthus stelis is found in various regions of Asia and is sometimes considered a weed in forest ecosystems."
