    "intro": "Lindera sericea var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
