    "intro": "Lupinus tuckerianus, commonly known as Tucker's lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as cliffs and slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pea-like flowers are usually blue or purple, appearing in clusters at the top of the stems. Tucker's lupine is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
