    "intro": "Lannea cinerascens, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense canopy, which provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand drought conditions. Lannea cinerascens is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
