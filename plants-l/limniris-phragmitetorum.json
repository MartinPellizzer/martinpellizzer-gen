    "intro": "Limniris phragmitetorum, commonly known as the marsh reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and blade-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Limniris phragmitetorum plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
