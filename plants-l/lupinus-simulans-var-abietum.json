    "intro": "Lupinus simulans var. abietum, commonly known as the white lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces spicate inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
