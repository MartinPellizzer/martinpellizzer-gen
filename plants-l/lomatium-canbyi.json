    "intro": "Lomatium canbyi, commonly known as Canby's lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Lomatium canbyi is also valued for its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
