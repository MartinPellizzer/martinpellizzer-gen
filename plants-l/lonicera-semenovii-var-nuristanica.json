    "intro": "Lonicera semenovii var. nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces yellowish-white to pale orange flowers, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
