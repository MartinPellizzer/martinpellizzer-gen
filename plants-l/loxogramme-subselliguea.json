    "intro": "Loxogramme subselliguea, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Loxogramme subselliguea plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for microorganisms."
