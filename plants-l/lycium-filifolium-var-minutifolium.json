It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
