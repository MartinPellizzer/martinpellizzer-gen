    "intro": "Leptolobium elongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved billygoat-weed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, elongated leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that dehisce to release the seeds. Leptolobium elongatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
