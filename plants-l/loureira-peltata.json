    "intro": "Loureira peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf lily or velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
