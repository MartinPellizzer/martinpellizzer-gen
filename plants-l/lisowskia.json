    "intro": "Lisowskia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the Andes mountains. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Onagraceae, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. Lisowskia is notable for its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lisowskia is considered a rare and endangered species."
