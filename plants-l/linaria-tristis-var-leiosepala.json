    "intro": "Linaria tristis var. leiosepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with two lips that resemble a toad's mouth, giving the species its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Linaria tristis."
