    "intro": "Luma costata, commonly known as the coastal luma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Luma costata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting coastal biodiversity."
