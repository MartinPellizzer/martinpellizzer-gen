    "intro": "Ladenbergia coriacea, commonly known as the hard-stemmed legume, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
