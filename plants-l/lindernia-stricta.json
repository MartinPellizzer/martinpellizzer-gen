    "intro": "Lindernia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lindernia stricta is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade."
