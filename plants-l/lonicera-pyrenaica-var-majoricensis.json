    "intro": "Lonicera pyrenaica var. majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, though they are not commonly consumed by humans."
