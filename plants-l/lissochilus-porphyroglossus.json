    "intro": "Lissochilus porphyroglossus, commonly known as the purple-lipped lissochilus, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-hued lips and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are small but showy, with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
