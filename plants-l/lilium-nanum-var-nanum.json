    "intro": "Lilium nanum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of only 10-20 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
