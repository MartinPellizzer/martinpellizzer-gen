    "intro": "Leptobalanus granvillei, commonly known as the Granville's evergreen heath, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
