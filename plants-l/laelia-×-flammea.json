It is characterized by its vibrant, fiery red and orange flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in varying environmental conditions. The leaves are dark green and strap-like, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms."
