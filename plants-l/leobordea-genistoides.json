    "intro": "Leobordea genistoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, linear leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to its harsh native habitat."
