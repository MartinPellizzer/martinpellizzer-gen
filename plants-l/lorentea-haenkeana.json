    "intro": "Lorentea haenkeana, commonly known as the Andes bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Lorentea haenkeana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
