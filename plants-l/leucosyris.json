    "intro": "Leucosyris, commonly known as the white broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their slender, branching stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. They produce pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Leucosyris species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
