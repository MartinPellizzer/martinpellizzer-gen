    "intro": "Lepanthes noelii, commonly known as the Noel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes noelii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
