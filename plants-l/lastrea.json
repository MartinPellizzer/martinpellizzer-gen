    "intro": "Lastrea, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting."
