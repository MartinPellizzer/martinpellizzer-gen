    "intro": "Lepidaploa fruticosa, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and ability to store water make it well adapted to desert conditions. Lepidaploa fruticosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
