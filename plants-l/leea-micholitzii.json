    "intro": "Leea micholitzii, commonly known as the Micholitz's leeah, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Leea micholitzii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
