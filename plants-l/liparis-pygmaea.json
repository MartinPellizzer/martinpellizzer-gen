    "intro": "Liparis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three petals and a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its low-growing appearance. Liparis pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
