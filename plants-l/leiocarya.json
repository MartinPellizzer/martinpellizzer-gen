    "intro": "Leiocarya, commonly known as the whiteleaf daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with white or pale-colored petals. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which gives the plant its common name. Leiocarya species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
