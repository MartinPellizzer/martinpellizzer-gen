    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features floating leaves that are smooth and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. This variety is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
