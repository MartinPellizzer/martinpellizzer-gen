    "intro": "Lupinus dichrous, commonly known as the twin-leaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Lupinus dichrous has adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil health in its native environments."
