It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus regnellianus is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
