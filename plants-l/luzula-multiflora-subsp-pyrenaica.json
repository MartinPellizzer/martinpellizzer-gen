    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
