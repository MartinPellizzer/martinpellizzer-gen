    "intro": "Lindsaea natunae, commonly known as the Hawaiian lindsaea, is a rare fern native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lindsaea natunae is considered a critically endangered species."
