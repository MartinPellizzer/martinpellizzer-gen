    "intro": "Lobelia coronopifolia var. simsii, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly woolly texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
