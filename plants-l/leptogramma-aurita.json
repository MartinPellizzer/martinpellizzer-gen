    "intro": "Leptogramma aurita, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Leptogramma aurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
