    "intro": "Lepimenes epithymum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a water-lily species native to the wetlands of South Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a pale yellow bud that gradually opens into a pinkish-red bloom. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. The plant plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism in Indian traditions."
