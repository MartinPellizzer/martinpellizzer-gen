    "intro": "Luzula pilosa var. americana, commonly known as American woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is often mistaken for a type of sedges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, typical of many sedges."
