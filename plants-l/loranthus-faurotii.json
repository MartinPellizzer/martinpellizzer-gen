    "intro": "Loranthus faurotii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of the host tree. Loranthus faurotii is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
