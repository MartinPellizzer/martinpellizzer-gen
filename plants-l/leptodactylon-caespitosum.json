    "intro": "Leptodactylon caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered in short, upright lobes. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its structure provides habitat for various microorganisms and contributes to soil formation in rocky habitats."
