    "intro": "Leandra mollis, commonly known as the silky waxplant, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Leandra mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
