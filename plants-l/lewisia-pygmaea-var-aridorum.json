    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea var. aridorum, commonly known as the desert lewisia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of the western United States. It features succulent, blue-green foliage that is adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for water-wise gardening."
