    "intro": "Lannea tomentosa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering its young stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. Lannea tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall."
