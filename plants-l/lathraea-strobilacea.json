    "intro": "Lathraea strobilacea, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique succulent belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is known for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, appearing dead but reviving when water becomes available. The plant has a creeping, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of its family. Lathraea strobilacea is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
