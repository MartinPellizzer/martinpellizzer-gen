    "intro": "Leuzea rhapontica subsp. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's leuzea, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
