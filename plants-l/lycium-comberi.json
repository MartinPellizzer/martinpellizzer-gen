    "intro": "Lycium comberi, commonly known as the silverleaf lycium, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to tolerate arid conditions. Lycium comberi is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
