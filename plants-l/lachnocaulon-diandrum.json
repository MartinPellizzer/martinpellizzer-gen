    "intro": "Lachnocaulon diandrum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small bells. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lachnocaulon diandrum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
