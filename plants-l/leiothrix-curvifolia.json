    "intro": "Leiothrix curvifolia, commonly known as the curly leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that curl and twist, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground growth. The leaves are evergreen, providing a lush green presence throughout the year."
