    "intro": "Lupinus aduncus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has feathery, compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus aduncus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
