    "intro": "Lagenandra toxicaria var. barnesii, commonly known as the Cape Cod poison ivy, is a variant of the toxicaria species native to the northeastern United States. It is a climbing vine characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often arranged in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is known for its potent urushiol oil, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans. This variant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is a common allergen in the region."
