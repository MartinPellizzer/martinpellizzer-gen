It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and reddish stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with a distinct alternation of generations between the gametophyte and sporophyte stages."
