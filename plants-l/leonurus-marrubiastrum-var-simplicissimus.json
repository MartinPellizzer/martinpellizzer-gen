    "intro": "Leonurus marrubiastrum var. simplicissimus, commonly known as lesser hedgehogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are hairy and branching, with opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
