It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in panicle-like inflorescences, and can be white, yellow, or greenish in color. Leandra peltata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
