    "intro": "Lycopodioides lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation and can revive when exposed to moisture, a trait known as anhydrobiosis. The plant has a simple, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves that are often tightly curled when dry. It thrives in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it can remain dormant for long periods. Its reproductive structures, including sporophylls and microsporangia, are adapted to ensure the dispersal of spores in dry conditions."
