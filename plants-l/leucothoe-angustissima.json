    "intro": "Leucothoe angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage that remains lush throughout the year. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, leathery berries. Its dense, compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for hedges or foundation plantings. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soils, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
