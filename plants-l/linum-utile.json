    "intro": "Linum utile, commonly known as flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender stem, alternate leaves, and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is cultivated primarily for its fibrous seeds, which are used to produce linen fabric and oil. Its flowers are also a valuable source of nectar for pollinators such as bees. Linum utile thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for both agricultural and ornamental purposes."
