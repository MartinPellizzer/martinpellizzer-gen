    "intro": "Lonchocarpus orizabensis, commonly known as the Mexican velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with small, velvety foliage. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
