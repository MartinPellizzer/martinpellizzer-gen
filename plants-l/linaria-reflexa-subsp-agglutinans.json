    "intro": "Linaria reflexa subsp. agglutinans, commonly known as the sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oblong seeds that are covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Linaria reflexa subsp. agglutinans is considered a perennial herb and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
