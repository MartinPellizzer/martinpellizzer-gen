    "intro": "Ledurgia guineensis, commonly known as African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces violet or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ledurgia guineensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
