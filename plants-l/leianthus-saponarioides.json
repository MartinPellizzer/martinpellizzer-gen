    "intro": "Leianthus saponarioides, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of saponins in its sap, which gives it a soapy texture and has been used traditionally for various purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
