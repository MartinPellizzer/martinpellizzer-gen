    "intro": "Liparis somae, commonly known as the Somalian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Somalia. It is a terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Liparis somae is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
