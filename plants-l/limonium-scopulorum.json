    "intro": "Limonium scopulorum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found growing in dunes and rocky coastal areas, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Limonium scopulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
