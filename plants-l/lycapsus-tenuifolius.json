    "intro": "Lycapsus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf lycapsus, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It is typically found in moist, temperate regions, often growing in shaded or woodland environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
