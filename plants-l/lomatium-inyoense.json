It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine habitat. Lomatium inyoense is often found in open meadows and is an important component of the local flora."
