    "intro": "Lycium shawii, commonly known as the desert\u67b8\u675e, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants, and is characterized by its small, bright red berries that resemble those of the common\u67b8\u675e. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its berries are edible and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for their nutritional and medicinal properties."
