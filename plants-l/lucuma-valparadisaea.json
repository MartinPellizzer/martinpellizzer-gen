    "intro": "Lucuma valparadisaea, commonly known as the golden fruit or lucuma, is a species of tree native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its large, yellow-orange berries that resemble a cross between a citrus fruit and a pumpkin. The fruit has a sweet, nutty flavor and is rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, fiber, and minerals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soil. The plant is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental value and traditional uses in Andean cultures."
