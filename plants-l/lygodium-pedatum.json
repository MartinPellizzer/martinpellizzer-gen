    "intro": "Lygodium pedatum, commonly known as the common climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
