    "intro": "Ludwigia litoranea, commonly known as the salt marsh ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Ludwigia litoranea is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
