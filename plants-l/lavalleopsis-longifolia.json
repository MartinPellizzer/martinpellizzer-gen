    "intro": "Lavalleopsis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lavalleopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
