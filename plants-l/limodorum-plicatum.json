    "intro": "Limodorum plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pleated leaves and striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are tubular and have a unique, zigzagging pattern in the petals, which gives it its common name. Limodorum plicatum is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
