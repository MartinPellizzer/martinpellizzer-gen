    "intro": "Linum alpinum subsp. laeve, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, smooth texture. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
