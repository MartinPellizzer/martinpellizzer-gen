    "intro": "Lithocarpus tenuinervis subsp. blaoensis, commonly known as the Blaoensis stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its evergreen nature and hard, woody fruit. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam and China. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with thick, leathery leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its fruit is a hard, one-seeded nut enclosed in a thick, woody shell, a common feature among members of the genus Lithocarpus. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, delicate veins on the leaves, which set it apart from other closely related species."
