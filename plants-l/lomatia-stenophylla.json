It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lomatia stenophylla is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rainforest environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
