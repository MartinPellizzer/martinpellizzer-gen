    "intro": "Lloydia striata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Carolinas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Lloydia striata is an herbaceous perennial that is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and marshes."
