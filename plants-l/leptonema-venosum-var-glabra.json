    "intro": "Leptonema venosum var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth leptonema, is a variant of the leptonema genus within the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and distinctive venation patterns. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
