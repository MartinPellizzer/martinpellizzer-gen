    "intro": "Loroglossum formosum, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that typically feature a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Loroglossum formosum is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
