    "intro": "Lotodes strobilinum, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lotodes, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers, which bloom in the early morning, are typically white or pale pink and have a distinctive, boat-shaped structure. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
