    "intro": "Limodorum microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers produce small, dark red berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Limodorum microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade with well-drained soil."
