    "intro": "Lathyrus elongatus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is less common than other Lathyrus species and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
