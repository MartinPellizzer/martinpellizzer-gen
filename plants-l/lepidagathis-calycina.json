    "intro": "Lepidagathis calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a perennial herb with a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish or reddish, and they appear in spikes during the wet season. Lepidagathis calycina is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
