It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
