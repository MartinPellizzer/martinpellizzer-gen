    "intro": "Lithophragma glabrum, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a thin layer of white wax. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pink or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. Lithophragma glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
