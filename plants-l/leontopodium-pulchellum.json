    "intro": "Leontopodium pulchellum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Due to its beauty and association with alpine ecosystems, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in the wild."
