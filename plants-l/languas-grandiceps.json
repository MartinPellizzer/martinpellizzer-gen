It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to two meters in length, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, during the wet season. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation areas and botanical gardens."
