    "intro": "Lepanthes helleri, commonly known as the Heller\u2019s slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble small slippers, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes helleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
