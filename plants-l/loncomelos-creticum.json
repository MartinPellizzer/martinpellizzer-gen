    "intro": "Loncomelos creticum, commonly known as the Cretan starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pale pink. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in arid and coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
