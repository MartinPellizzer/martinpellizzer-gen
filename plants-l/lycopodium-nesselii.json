    "intro": "Lycopodium nesselii, commonly known as the Nessel's clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its sporophyte structure consists of a short, unbranched stem with whorled leaves and terminal cones. Lycopodium nesselii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
