It is characterized by its distinctive, showy red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster, with each bloom having a unique, intricate structure. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its rarity and beauty."
