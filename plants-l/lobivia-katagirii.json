    "intro": "Lobivia katagirii, commonly known as the Katagiri lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental cactus in gardens and collections."
