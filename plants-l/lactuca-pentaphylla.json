    "intro": "Lactuca pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its rosette of large, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a mild, slightly bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into small, spiky fruits known as achenes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Lactuca pentaphylla is often grown as a leafy vegetable and is valued for its nutritional content and use in salads."
