    "intro": "Ligusticum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic chrysanthemum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
