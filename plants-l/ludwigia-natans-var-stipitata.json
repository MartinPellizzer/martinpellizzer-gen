    "intro": "Ludwigia natans var. stipitata, commonly known as the floating water primrose, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
