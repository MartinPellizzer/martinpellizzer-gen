    "intro": "Laportea stolonifera, commonly known as creeping heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Laportea stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
