    "intro": "Lasiocephalus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable-leaf lasiocephalus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either simple or compound depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is noted for its adaptability and is often found in riparian habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
