It belongs to the primrose family (Primulaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which give it its common name. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lithophragma trilobum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or open slopes."
