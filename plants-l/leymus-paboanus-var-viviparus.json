    "intro": "Leymus paboanus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where viable seedlings develop on the mother plant before detaching and taking root independently. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
