    "intro": "Lithocarpus craterophorus, commonly known as the mountain ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces hard, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its durable timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
