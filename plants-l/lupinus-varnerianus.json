    "intro": "Lupinus varnerianus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus varnerianus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
