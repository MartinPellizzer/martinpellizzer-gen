    "intro": "Loasa lenta, commonly known as slow-growing loasa, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers in late spring, which are borne on short peduncles. Loasa lenta is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
