    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus subsp. ochropetalus, commonly known as the white-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly areas and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
