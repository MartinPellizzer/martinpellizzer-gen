    "intro": "Ludwigia permollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Ludwigia permollis thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for pond gardens and wetland restoration projects. Its rapid growth rate and ability to tolerate a range of water conditions contribute to its ecological and ornamental value."
