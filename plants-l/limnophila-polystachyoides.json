    "intro": "Limnophila polystachyoides, commonly known as the water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root in shallow water, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
