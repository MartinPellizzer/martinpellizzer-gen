    "intro": "Lovoa klaineana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
