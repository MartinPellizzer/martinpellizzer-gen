    "intro": "Lycopodium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves that give it a dense, mat-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the ends of its branches. Lycopodium umbrosum is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical forests."
