    "intro": "Lagerstroemia spireana, commonly known as the crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, long-lasting flowers that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes more textured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread."
