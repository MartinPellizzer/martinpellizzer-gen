    "intro": "Lilium grayi, commonly known as Gray's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in high-elevation environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous roots that store nutrients. Due to its limited habitat and threats from development and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
