    "intro": "Lycopodium selago f. sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss plant characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with rhizomes that help anchor it to the soil. Its spores are released from terminal cones, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats. The foliage is often covered in a fine layer of moss-like vegetation, enhancing its ecological role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation."
