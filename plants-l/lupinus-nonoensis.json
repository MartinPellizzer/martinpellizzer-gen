    "intro": "Lupinus nonoensis, commonly known as the Nono Valley lupin, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its pods contain several seeds. Lupinus nonoensis is adapted to cool, dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
