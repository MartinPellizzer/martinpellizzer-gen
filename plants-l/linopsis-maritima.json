    "intro": "Linopsis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Linopsis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
