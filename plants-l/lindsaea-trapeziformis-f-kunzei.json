    "intro": "Lindsaea trapeziformis f. kunzei, commonly known as the Kunze's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures are complex, featuring specialized spore-bearing leaves known as sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
