    "intro": "Lychnis tristis, commonly known as the sorrowful cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and a distinctive, spurred calyx that becomes prominent as the flower matures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Lychnis tristis is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
