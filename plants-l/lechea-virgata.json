    "intro": "Lechea virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a defining feature of the genus Lechea. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Lechea virgata plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly certain species of butterflies."
