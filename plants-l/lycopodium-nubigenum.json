    "intro": "Lycopodium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of true ferns. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Lycopodium nubigenum is typically found in temperate regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
