    "intro": "Limonium cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Limonium cretaceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
