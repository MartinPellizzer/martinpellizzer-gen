    "intro": "Linum coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuila flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a member of the Linaceae family, characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Linum coahuilense is often found in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
