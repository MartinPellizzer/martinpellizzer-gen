    "intro": "Loranthus clementis, commonly known as the Christmas or mistletoe plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often associated with festive traditions and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
