    "intro": "Loranthus globosus, commonly known as the globe mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus globosus is widely distributed across Australia and is an important component of the region's ecological systems."
