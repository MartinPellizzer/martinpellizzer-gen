    "intro": "Leptochloa longa, commonly known as slender flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Leptochloa longa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
