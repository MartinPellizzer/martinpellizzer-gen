It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that appear in winter. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Leptospermum virgatum is valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
