    "intro": "Loranthus intermedius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
