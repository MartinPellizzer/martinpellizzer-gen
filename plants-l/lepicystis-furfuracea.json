    "intro": "Lepicystis furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. Lepicystis furfuracea is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
