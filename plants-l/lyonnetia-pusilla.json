    "intro": "Lyonnetia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf Lyonnetia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lyonnetia pusilla is often found in moist, sunny habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
