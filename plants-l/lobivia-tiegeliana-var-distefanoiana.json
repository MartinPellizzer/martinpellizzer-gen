    "intro": "Lobivia tiegeliana var. distefanoiana, commonly known as the Distefano's Lobivia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, often adorned with white or pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
