    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. springii, commonly known as the spring clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems and contain the spores. This variety is notable for its early spring emergence and its role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems."
