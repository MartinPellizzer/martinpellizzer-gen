    "intro": "Lagotis alutacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Lagotis alutacea is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
