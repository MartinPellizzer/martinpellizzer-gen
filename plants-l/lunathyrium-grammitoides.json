    "intro": "Lunathyrium grammitoides, commonly known as the silver feather fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble soft, silver threads. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, contributing to its common name. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
