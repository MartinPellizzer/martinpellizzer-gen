This low-growing plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
