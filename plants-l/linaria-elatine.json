It features slender, branching stems that bear small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.
