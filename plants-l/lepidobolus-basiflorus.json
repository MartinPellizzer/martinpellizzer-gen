    "intro": "Lepidobolus basiflorus, commonly known as the basiflorous lepidobolus, is a rare and unusual member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with flowers that are clustered at the base of the stem, a feature that gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
