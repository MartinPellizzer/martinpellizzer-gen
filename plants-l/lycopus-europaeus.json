    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus, commonly known as European bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its roots are commonly used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopus europaeus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
