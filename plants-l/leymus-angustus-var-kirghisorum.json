It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
