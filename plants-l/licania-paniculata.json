    "intro": "Licania paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Licania paniculata is also known for its ecological importance in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
