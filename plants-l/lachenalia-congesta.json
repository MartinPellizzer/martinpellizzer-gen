It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Lachenalia congesta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
