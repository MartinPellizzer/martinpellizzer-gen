    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf lemmaphyllum, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact stature and unique leaf structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
