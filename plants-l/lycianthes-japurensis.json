It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, orange-colored berries that are encased in a fleshy, lantern-shaped calyx. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
