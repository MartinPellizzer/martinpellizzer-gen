    "intro": "Leocereus bahiensis subsp. robustispinus, commonly known as the robust spiny cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its robust, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the axils of the areoles. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its dense spination and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
