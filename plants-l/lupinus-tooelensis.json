It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds.

It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
