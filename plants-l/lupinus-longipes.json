    "intro": "Lupinus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus longipes is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
