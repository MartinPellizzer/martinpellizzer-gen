It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its bulbous root system is adapted to survive in rocky or well-drained soils. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens."
