    "intro": "Leymus kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdag Leymus, is a grass species native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly around the Kopetdag Mountains. It is a perennial plant that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
