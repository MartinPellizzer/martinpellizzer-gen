    "intro": "Lepidium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. The plant has small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, segmented capsule that contains several small, rounded seeds. It is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
