    "intro": "Lappa \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are highly visible and attract pollinators. Lappa \u00d7 mixta is known for its toxic sap, which contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
