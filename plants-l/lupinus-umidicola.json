    "intro": "Lupinus umidicola, commonly known as the wetland lupine, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus umidicola plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
