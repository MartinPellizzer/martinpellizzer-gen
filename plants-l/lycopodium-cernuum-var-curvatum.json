    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. curvatum, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate regions."
