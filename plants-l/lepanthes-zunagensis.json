    "intro": "Lepanthes zunagensis, commonly known as the Zunag\u00e9n's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant features a short rhizome and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique slipper-shaped pouch. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes zunagensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
