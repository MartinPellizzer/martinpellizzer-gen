    "intro": "Lithocardium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Lithocardium oxyphyllum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability in mountainous areas."
