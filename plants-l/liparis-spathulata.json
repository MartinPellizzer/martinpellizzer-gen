    "intro": "Liparis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. Liparis spathulata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
