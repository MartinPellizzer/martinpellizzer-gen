    "intro": "Lanonia centralis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often fragrant, and its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical in shape. Lanonia centralis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
