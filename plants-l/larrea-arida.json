    "intro": "Larrea arida, commonly known as screwwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, sandy soils. Larrea arida is often used in traditional medicine and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
