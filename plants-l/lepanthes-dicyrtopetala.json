    "intro": "Lepanthes dicyrtopetala, commonly known as the two-cupped orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a unique two-cupped structure in the lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that help it absorb moisture and light in its natural habitat. Lepanthes dicyrtopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
