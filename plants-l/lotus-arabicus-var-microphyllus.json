It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry soils and withstand periods of drought. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
