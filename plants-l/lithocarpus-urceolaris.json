    "intro": "Lithocarpus urceolaris, commonly known as the broad-leafed stone\u680e, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. Its fruit is a hard, woody nut enclosed in a thick, cup-like structure called an urn, hence its specific epithet \"urceolaris.\" This species is valued for its durable timber and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
