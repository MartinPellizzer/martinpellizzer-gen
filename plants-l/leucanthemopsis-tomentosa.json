    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly oxeye, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by a central cluster of yellow disk florets. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The woolly oxeye is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like appearance."
