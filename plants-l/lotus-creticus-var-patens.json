    "intro": "Lotus creticus var. patens, commonly known as the Mediterranean water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are usually heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are showy, with pink to reddish petals that open in the morning and close in the evening. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and its role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
