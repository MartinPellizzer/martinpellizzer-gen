    "intro": "Lamourouxia longiflora var. integerrima, commonly known as the long-flowered lamourouxia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically upright, making it suitable for both garden borders and container cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
