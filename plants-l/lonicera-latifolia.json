    "intro": "Lonicera latifolia, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically broad and shiny. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are red when mature, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Lonicera latifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits."
