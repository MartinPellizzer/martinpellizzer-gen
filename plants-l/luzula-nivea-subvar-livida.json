    "intro": "Luzula nivea subvar. livida, commonly known as the alpine wood sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Due to its cold tolerance and unique morphology, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
