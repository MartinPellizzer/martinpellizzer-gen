It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a thick cuticle. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the upright growth of its fronds. Leptosiphonium papuanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
