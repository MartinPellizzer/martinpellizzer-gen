    "intro": "Liparis cespitosa var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks, where it thrives in acidic soils. The plant produces a rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to form dense clumps through rhizome growth. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
