    "intro": "Loranthus cupulifer, commonly known as the mistletoe of the cupulate type, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees and begin new infections. This plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various animals."
