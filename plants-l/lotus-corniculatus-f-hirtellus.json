    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus f. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy horned vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
