    "intro": "Lactuca prolixa, commonly known as the slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically long and narrow. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Lactuca. This plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
