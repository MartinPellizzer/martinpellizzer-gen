    "intro": "Lotus allionii, commonly known as the Persian lotus, is a species of water lily native to the Caspian Sea region. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to repel water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The Persian lotus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in traditional medicine and art."
