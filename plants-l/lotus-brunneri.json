It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy pink or purple flowers. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in wetland ecosystems."
