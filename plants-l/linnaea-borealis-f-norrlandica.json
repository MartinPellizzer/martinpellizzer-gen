    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. norrlandica, commonly known as the Norwegian twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to boreal and subarctic regions of northern Europe and North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its two small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This rare form is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
