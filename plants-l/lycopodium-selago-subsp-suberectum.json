    "intro": "Lycopodium selago subsp. suberectum, commonly known as the erect clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. This subspecies is notable for its upright growth form, distinguishing it from other members of the Lycopodium genus."
