    "intro": "Linum hirsutum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form dense cushions, adapting to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant and cold-hardy nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
