    "intro": "Lepidium lasiocarpum var. rosulatum, commonly known as the rosette cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a peppery taste, similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
