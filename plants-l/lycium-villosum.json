    "intro": "Lycium villosum, commonly known as the silverberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy foliage and small, red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs. Lycium villosum is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
