    "intro": "Luzula sylvatica pallida, commonly known as the pale woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense carpets on forest floors. Luzula sylvatica pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
