    "intro": "Lastrea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features hairy, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist conditions. The roots of Lastrea paludosa are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
