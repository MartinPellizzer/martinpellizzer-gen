    "intro": "Lepidium moabense, commonly known as Moab mustard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Lepidium moabense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range."
