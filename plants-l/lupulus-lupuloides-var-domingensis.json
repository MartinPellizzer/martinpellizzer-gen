    "intro": "Lupulus lupuloides var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican hops, is a lesser-known variety of hops native to the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its unique aroma profile, which includes notes of citrus, tropical fruit, and a subtle herbal undertone. The plant produces cone-shaped flowers, known as hop cones, which are rich in essential oils and bitter compounds. These cones are typically harvested when they reach full maturity, ensuring optimal flavor and aroma. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a rare and specialized ingredient in craft brewing."
