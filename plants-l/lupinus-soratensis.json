    "intro": "Lupinus soratensis, commonly known as the Sorato lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source by local communities. Lupinus soratensis is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies in its native habitat."
