    "intro": "Lathyrus brachycalyx var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx pea, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
