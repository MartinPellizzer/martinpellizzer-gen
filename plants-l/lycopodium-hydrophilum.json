    "intro": "Lycopodium hydrophilum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form compact, cushion-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its sporophytes produce spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Lycopodium hydrophilum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms in its native wetland habitats."
