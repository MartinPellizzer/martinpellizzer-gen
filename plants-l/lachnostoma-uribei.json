    "intro": "Lachnostoma uribei, commonly known as the Uribei's lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, flat thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically pale green to yellowish, while the lower surface is more or less white and covered with isidia and soredia. This lichen is often found on bark and wood in moist, shaded environments. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
