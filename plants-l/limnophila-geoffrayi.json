    "intro": "Limnophila geoffrayi, commonly known as the water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Limnophila geoffrayi produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. It plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
