    "intro": "Lindera citrata, commonly known as the lemon thyme or Japanese spice bush, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features aromatic leaves that emit a citrus-like scent when crushed, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, particularly in Chinese cuisine, for their distinctive flavor. Lindera citrata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
