    "intro": "Limeum nummulifolium, commonly known as the nummulite leaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive, coin-shaped leaves that are thick and succulent, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful cultivation."
