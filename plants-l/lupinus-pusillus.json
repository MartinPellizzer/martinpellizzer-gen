It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus pusillus is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
