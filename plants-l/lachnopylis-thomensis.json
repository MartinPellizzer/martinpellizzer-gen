    "intro": "Lachnopylis thomensis, commonly known as the Tomine mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
