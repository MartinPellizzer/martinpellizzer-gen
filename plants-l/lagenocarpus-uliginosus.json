    "intro": "Lagenocarpus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, waterlogged soils and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Lagenocarpus uliginosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
