    "intro": "Lolium cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Lolium cylindricum is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in agricultural settings."
