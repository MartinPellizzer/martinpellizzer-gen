It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that bears clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.
