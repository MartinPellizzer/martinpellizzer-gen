    "intro": "Lycaste skinneri subvar. alba, commonly known as the white lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. This subvariety is highly valued by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity in cultivation."
