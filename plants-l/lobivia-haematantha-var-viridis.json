It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stem with a greenish hue and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
