It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, forming compact clusters of leafy shoots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and arranged in two rows along the stems. Lankesterella caespitosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
