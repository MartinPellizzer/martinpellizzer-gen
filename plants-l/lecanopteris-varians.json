    "intro": "Lecanopteris varians, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Lecanopteris varians is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
