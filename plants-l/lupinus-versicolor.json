    "intro": "Lupinus versicolor, commonly known as the variable lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus versicolor is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
