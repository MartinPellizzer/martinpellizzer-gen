    "intro": "Liparis vexillifera var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
