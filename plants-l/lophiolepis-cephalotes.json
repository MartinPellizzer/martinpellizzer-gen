    "intro": "Lophiolepis cephalotes, commonly known as the Cape mountain zebra plant, is a succulent belonging to the Asphodelaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
