    "intro": "Lastrea richardsii var. multifida, commonly known as the multifid lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white or pinkish markings. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
