    "intro": "Loxonia burttiana, commonly known as the Burtt's lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichen, typically found on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. The thallus is foliose, with a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure that is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration and the presence of isidiate structures. Loxonia burttiana is of interest to lichenologists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
