    "intro": "Lupinus kunthii, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus kunthii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
