    "intro": "Leptochilus minor, commonly known as the small-leaved water cress, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and borne on short pedicels, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Leptochilus minor is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also a food source for aquatic animals."
