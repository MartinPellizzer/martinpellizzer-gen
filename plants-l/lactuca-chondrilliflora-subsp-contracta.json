    "intro": "Lactuca chondrilliflora subsp. contracta, commonly known as the dwarf lettuce, is a subspecies of the lettuce genus native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, woody seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other lettuces but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
