    "intro": "Leichhardtia velutina, commonly known as the velvet leaf leichhardtia, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Leichhardtia velutina is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an attractive species for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
