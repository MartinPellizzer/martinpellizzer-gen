    "intro": "Loranthus laetus, commonly known as the happy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often causing no immediate harm but potentially affecting the host's growth over time. Its small, white or pale green berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus laetus is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, and is often found in forested areas."
