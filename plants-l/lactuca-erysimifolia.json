    "intro": "Lactuca erysimifolia, commonly known as the leafy lettuce or the Italian lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, dark green, slightly curly leaves that are often used in salads. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seed heads that are similar to those of dandelions. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Lactuca erysimifolia is valued for its crisp, mild-tasting leaves and its ornamental appeal."
