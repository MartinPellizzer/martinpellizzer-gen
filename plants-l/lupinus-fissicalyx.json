It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
