    "intro": "Lindsaea brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant features closely packed, leathery leaves that form a rosette, often with a central water-holding cavity. Lindsaea brachypoda produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short, branched inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests."
