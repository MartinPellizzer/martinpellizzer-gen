    "intro": "Linaria supina var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf sand rocket, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
