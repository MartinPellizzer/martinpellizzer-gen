    "intro": "Longetia malayana, commonly known as the Malay climbing fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, climbing fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas."
