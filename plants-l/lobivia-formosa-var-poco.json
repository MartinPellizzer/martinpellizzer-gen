    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. poco, commonly known as the \"Little Lobivia,\" is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with sparse, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
