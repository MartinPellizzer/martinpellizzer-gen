    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. nericia, commonly known as the northern twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive pairs of opposite, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is closely related to the typical Linnaea borealis and shares similar ecological preferences and botanical features."
