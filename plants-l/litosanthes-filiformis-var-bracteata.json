    "intro": "Litosanthes filiformis var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate litosanthes, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The bracteate variety is distinguished by the presence of specialized bracts that surround its inflorescences."
