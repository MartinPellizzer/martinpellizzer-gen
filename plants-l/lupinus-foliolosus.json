    "intro": "Lupinus foliolosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with closely spaced leaflets. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus foliolosus has deep taproots that help it thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
