    "intro": "Lupinus viduus, commonly known as the ghost lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Lupinus viduus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
