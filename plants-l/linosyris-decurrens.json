    "intro": "Linosyris decurrens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette formation. Linosyris decurrens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats."
