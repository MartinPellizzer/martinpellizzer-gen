    "intro": "Listera nanchuanica, commonly known as the Nanchuan basketflower, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
