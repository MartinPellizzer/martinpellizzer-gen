    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring dragonhead, is a flowering plant native to the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant thrives in mineral-rich, geothermal environments, which contribute to its unique botanical characteristics. Its scientific name reflects its habitat, with \"thermarum\" referring to heat, and \"lasiorrhiza\" relating to its hairy roots. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme thermal conditions."
