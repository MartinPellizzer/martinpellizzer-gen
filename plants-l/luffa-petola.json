    "intro": "Luffa petola, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy, hollow structures used for scrubbing. Its leaves are broad and lobed, while its stems are hairy and trailing. Luffa petola is valued both for its culinary uses and as a natural exfoliating tool."
