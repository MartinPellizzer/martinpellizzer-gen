    "intro": "Ligularia lamarum, commonly known as the Alpine ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, which bloom in late summer. Ligularia lamarum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and shady landscapes."
