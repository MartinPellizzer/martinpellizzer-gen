    "intro": "Leontopodium hayachinense var. miyabeanum, commonly known as the Miya's edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its unique morphology and habitat make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
