    "intro": "Lepanthes mollis, commonly known as the soft leanthes, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendant-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-shaped, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Lepanthes mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
