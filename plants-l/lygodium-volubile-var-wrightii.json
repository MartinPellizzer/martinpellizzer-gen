    "intro": "Lygodium volubile var. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and fronds that are divided into small, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a unique feature of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. Its intricate frond structure and adaptability to wet habitats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
