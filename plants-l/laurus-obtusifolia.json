    "intro": "Laurus obtusifolia, commonly known as bay laurel or sweet bay, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly toothed and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and hedging. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are widely used in cooking, perfumery, and traditional medicine."
