    "intro": "Lycaste rugosa, commonly known as the rough lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Lycaste rugosa is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
