    "intro": "Lotus exstipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in water repellence. Its roots system helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Lotus exstipularis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in ponds and water gardens."
