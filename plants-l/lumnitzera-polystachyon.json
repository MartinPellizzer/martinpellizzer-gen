    "intro": "Lumnitzera polystachyon, commonly known as the mangrove shrub or sea silk, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Lumnitzera polystachyon plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitats for marine life."
