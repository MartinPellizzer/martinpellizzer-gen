    "intro": "Lindsaea crenata, commonly known as the serrated lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated at the edges, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Lindsaea crenata is well-suited to bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to thrive."
