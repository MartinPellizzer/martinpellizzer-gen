    "intro": "Laxmannia ramosa, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Laxmannia ramosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
