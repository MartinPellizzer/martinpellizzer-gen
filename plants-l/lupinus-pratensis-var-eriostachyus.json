    "intro": "Lupinus pratensis var. eriostachyus, commonly known as the early lupin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom early in the growing season. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites."
