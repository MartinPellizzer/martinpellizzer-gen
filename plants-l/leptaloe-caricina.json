    "intro": "Leptaloe caricina, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is noted for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, making it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
