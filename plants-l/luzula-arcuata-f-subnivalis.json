    "intro": "Luzula arcuata f. subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine wood sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically dark green and slightly curled, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
