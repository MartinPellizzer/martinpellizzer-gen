    "intro": "Luma exsucca, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Brazil. It has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various coastal environments. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
