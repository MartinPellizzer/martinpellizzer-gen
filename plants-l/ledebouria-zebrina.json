    "intro": "Ledebouria zebrina, commonly known as the zebra lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, grass-like leaves with distinctive white and green vertical stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
