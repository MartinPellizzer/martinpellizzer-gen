    "intro": "Limonium acutifolium subsp. bosanum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, an adaptation to its saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
