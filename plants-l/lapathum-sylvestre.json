    "intro": "Lapathum sylvestre, commonly known as common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more pointed. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges across Europe. Lapathum sylvestre is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
