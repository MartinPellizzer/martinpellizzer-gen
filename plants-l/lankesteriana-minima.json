It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. It is prized for its compact size and striking floral display, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
