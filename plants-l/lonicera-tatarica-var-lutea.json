    "intro": "Lonicera tatarica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
