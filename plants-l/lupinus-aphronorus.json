    "intro": "Lupinus aphronorus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus aphronorus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life in its habitat."
