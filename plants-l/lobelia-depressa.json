    "intro": "Lobelia depressa, commonly known as the prostrate lobelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Lobelia depressa is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
