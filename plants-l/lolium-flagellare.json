    "intro": "Lolium flagellare, commonly known as the slender grass or red grass, is a species of annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and slender, often reddish stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Lolium flagellare is an important forage plant for livestock and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
