The plant's flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens."
