It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and features small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Lysipomia variabilis has a fibrous root system and is often found in grasslands and wetlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to diverse habitats and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
