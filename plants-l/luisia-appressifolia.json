    "intro": "Luisia appressifolia, commonly known as the creeping luisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in landscaping."
