    "intro": "Ligusticum mutellina proles adonidifolium, commonly known as the Adonis-leaved Ligusticum, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the Adonis genus, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a single umbel, typical of many members of its family. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, often in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of conservation concern in its native range."
