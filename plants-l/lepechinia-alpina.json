    "intro": "Lepechinia alpina, commonly known as alpine lepechinia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lepechinia alpina is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
