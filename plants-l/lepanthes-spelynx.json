    "intro": "Lepanthes spelynx, commonly known as the cave orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane regions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat destruction, Lepanthes spelynx is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas or botanical collections."
