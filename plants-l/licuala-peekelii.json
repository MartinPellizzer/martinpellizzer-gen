It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into woody, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Licuala peekelii thrives in humid, coastal environments and is well adapted to sandy soils."
