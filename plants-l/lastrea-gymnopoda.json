    "intro": "Lastrea gymnopoda, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive dry periods. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
