    "intro": "Loxogramme porcata, commonly known as the hairy water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which aid in water retention and provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Loxogramme porcata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems."
