    "intro": "Lupinus lepidus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and hairy, upright stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Lupinus lepidus belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are edible when properly prepared and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
