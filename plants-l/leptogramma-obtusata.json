    "intro": "Leptogramma obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved leptogramma, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its broad, leathery, and often lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of South America, Africa, and Australia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture that aids in water retention and protection against herbivores."
