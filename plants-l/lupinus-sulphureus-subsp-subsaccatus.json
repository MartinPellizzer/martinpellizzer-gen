    "intro": "Lupinus sulphureus subsp. subsaccatus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many lupine species. This subspecies is native to the western United States and grows in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The plant is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
