    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. collinus, commonly known as the creeping yellow clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
