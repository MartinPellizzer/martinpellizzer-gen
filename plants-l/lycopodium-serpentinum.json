    "intro": "Lycopodium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, particularly on serpentine rock outcrops. L. serpentinum is an important component of certain forest ecosystems and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
