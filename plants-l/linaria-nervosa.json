    "intro": "Linaria nervosa, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Linaria nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
