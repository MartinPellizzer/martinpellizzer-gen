    "intro": "Lupinus aridulus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lupinus aridulus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
