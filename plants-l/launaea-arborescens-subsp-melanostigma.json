    "intro": "Launaea arborescens subsp. melanostigma, commonly known as the black-stigma launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub or small tree with a woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are visited by various pollinators. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its dark-colored stigma, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus."
