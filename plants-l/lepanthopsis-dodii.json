    "intro": "Lepanthopsis dodii, commonly known as the Dodii's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Lepanthopsis dodii is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
