    "intro": "Lilium michiganense f. uniflorum, commonly known as the Michigan lily, is a rare and unique variant of the Michigan lily, characterized by its single flower per stem. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink to reddish in color, with a distinct greenish throat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces underground bulbs for storage and propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
