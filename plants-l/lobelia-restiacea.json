    "intro": "Lobelia restiacea, commonly known as the coastal lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its small, tubular blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Lobelia restiacea is often found in maritime environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Its botanical features make it a unique and resilient plant in coastal habitats."
