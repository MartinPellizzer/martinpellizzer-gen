    "intro": "Leiothrix longipes, commonly known as the long-footed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its elongated, fleshy roots and narrow, strap-like leaves are adaptations to its moist, nutrient-poor habitat. Leiothrix longipes is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
