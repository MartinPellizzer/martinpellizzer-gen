    "intro": "Laurus bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is glossy and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are followed by small, dark blue berries. The leaves are often used in culinary applications, similar to other laurel species, though it is less commonly cultivated than Laurus nobilis."
