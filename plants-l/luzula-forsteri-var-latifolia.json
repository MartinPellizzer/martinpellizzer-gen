    "intro": "Luzula forsteri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other Luzula species, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Luzula forsteri var. latifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
