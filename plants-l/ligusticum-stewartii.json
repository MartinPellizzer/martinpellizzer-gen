It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, woodland habitats. Ligusticum stewartii is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
