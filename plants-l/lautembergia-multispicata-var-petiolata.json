It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with multiple branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its adaptability to salt spray and sandy soils makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
