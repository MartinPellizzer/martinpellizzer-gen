    "intro": "Lycium parishii, commonly known as the Chinese wolfberry or Goji berry, is a shrub native to China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant features small, yellow flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are rich in antioxidants and nutrients. Lycium parishii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its berries are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a food source due to their high nutritional value."
