It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Lepisorus chinensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
