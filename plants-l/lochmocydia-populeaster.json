    "intro": "Lochmocydia populeaster, commonly known as the poplar leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces distinctive galls on the leaves of poplar trees. The galls are formed when the female midge lays eggs on the underside of poplar leaves, triggering a localized plant response that results in the formation of swollen, abnormal growths. These galls provide both protection and nourishment for the developing larvae. The plant's defense mechanisms are activated by chemical signals released by the midge's eggs. While the galls can alter the appearance of the leaves, they typically do not cause significant harm to the overall health of the tree."
