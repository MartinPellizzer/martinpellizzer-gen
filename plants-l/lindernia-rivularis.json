It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its attractive appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
