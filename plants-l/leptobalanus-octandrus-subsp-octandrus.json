    "intro": "Leptobalanus octandrus subsp. octandrus, commonly known as the Atlantic rock pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Azores. It is a gymnosperm, belonging to the family Pinaceae, and is characterized by its unique, dense, and slow-growing wood. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
