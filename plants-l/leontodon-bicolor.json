    "intro": "Leontodon bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads with a distinctive dark central disk, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are usually erect and unbranched. Leontodon bicolor is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it is often found in calcareous soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas."
