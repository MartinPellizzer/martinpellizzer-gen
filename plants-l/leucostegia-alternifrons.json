    "intro": "Leucostegia alternifrons, commonly known as the alternate-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
