    "intro": "Lupinus nanus var. apricus, commonly known as the spring lupine, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 inches and features delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its small size and early blooming habit make it an attractive addition to pollinator-friendly gardens."
