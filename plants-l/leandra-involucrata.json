    "intro": "Leandra involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety green leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leandra involucrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
