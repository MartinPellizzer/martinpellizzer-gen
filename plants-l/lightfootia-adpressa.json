    "intro": "Lightfootia adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including drought and extreme temperatures. Lightfootia adpressa plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
