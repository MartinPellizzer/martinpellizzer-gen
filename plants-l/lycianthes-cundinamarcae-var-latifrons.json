It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into oval, edible berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
