    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blue flax, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is closely related to the common blue flax, but it differs in leaf shape and flower size. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas."
