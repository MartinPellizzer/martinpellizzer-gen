    "intro": "Lunathyrium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds that resemble a moon's shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
