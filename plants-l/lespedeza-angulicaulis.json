    "intro": "Lespedeza angulicaulis, commonly known as angular lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinct angular appearance, contributing to its common name. Lespedeza angulicaulis is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
