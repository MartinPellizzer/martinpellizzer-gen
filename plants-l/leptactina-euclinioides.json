    "intro": "Leptactina euclinioides, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
