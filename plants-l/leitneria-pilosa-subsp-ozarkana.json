    "intro": "Leitneria pilosa subsp. ozarkana, commonly known as Ozark leatherleaf, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
