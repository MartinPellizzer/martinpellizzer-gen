    "intro": "Laportea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit and its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its most notable botanical feature is the production of bulb-like structures at the base of the plant, which can store nutrients and aid in propagation. Laportea bulbifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
