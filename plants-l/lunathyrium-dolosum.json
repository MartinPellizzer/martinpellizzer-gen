    "intro": "Lunathyrium dolosum, commonly known as the deceptive moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers open only at night, closing shortly after dawn, which is an adaptation to its specific pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lunathyrium dolosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
