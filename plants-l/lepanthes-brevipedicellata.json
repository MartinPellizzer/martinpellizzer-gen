    "intro": "Lepanthes brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stemmed urn orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
