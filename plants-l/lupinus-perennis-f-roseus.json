    "intro": "Lupinus perennis f. roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, rose-pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, open woods, and disturbed sites. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
