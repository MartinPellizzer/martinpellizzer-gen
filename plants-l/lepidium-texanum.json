    "intro": "Lepidium texanum, commonly known as Texas peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, green, leafy stems and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Lepidium texanum is adapted to arid environments and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
