    "intro": "Lobelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Lobelia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
