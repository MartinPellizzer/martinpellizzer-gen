    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana var. quiabayensis, commonly known as the Quiabayensis Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features compact, rounded stems that are often covered in a dense coating of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted for storing water in its native desert environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in well-draining soil and full sun."
