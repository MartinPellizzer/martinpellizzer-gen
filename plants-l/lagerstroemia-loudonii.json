    "intro": "Lagerstroemia loudonii, commonly known as the Loudon's crepe myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has smooth, grayish bark that peels in thin, papery layers, a feature that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Lagerstroemia loudonii is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for landscape planting."
