    "intro": "Lindsaea improvisa, commonly known as the creeping lindera, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce adventitious roots. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea improvisa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
