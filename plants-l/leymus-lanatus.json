    "intro": "Leymus lanatus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Leymus lanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
