    "intro": "Loeseneriella urceolus f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved basket lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure. It features a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface with a dense, woolly texture. The lower surface is typically covered with a network of rhizines and is often more deeply pigmented. This lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or stone. Its morphology and habitat make it a distinctive species within the family Parmeliaceae."
