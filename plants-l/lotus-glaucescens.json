    "intro": "Lotus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters in moist environments. The botanical name reflects its pale blue coloration, which is a distinguishing feature of the species."
