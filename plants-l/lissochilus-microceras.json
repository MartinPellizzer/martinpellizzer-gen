    "intro": "Lissochilus microceras, commonly known as the small-horned lissochilus, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive, small, horn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually a mix of white and green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators."
