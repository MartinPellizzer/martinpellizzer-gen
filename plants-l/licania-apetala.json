It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves on the lower part of its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Licania apetala is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
