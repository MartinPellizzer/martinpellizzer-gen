    "intro": "Lupinus lespedezoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus lespedezoides is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
