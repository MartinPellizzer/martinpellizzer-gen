    "intro": "Linaria auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive auricle-like structure at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria auriculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
