    "intro": "Lachnocaulon floridanum, commonly known as the Florida lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in the southeastern United States. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its partnership with photosynthetic organisms for nutrition. Its structure is delicate and often forms crust-like or foliose growths. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for forest health and biodiversity."
