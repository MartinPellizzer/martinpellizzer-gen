    "intro": "Lactuca latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often used in salads. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into small, spiky fruits called achenes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in various regions around the world. Lactuca latifolia is often cultivated for its edible leaves and has a mild, slightly bitter taste."
