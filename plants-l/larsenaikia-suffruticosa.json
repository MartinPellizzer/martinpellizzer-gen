It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Larsenaikia suffruticosa is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
