It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded areas. The subspecies rigida is distinguished by its more rigid and upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Lirianthe."
