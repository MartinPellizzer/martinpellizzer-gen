    "intro": "Loxotrema triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is characterized by its crust-like growth form and is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants. The thallus of Loxotrema triflora is usually pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface."
