    "intro": "Lupinus montanus var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. This variety is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy foliage compared to other lupine species."
