    "intro": "Luma planiramea, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are consumed by various bird species. Luma planiramea is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife."
