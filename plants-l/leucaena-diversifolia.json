    "intro": "Leucaena diversifolia, commonly known as the blue leucaena, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is often grown for its forage value and nitrogen-fixing ability. Leucaena diversifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for reforestation and agroforestry projects."
