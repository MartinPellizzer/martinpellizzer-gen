    "intro": "Lithocardium album, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Lithocardium album is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in xeriscaping."
