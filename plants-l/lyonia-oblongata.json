It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen to deciduous foliage depending on the climate. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during late spring, followed by small, leathery fruits. The leaves are elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
