    "intro": "Lapeirousia divaricata var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed marsh daffodil, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in regions with high rainfall. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanists and gardeners interested in native flora."
