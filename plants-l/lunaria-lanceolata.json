    "intro": "Lunaria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonflower, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, moon-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, shiny seeds, which are often used in crafts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Lunaria lanceolata is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
