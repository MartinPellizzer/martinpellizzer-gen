    "intro": "Lathyrus coerulescens, commonly known as the blue flax or blue vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces slender, erect stems that often grow in clumps, and its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it also serves as a beneficial plant in agricultural settings."
