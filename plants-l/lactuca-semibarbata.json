    "intro": "Lactuca semibarbata, commonly known as the semi-barbed lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The leaves are typically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive barbed leaf margins, which are a key identifying feature."
