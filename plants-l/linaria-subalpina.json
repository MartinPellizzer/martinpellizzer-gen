    "intro": "Linaria subalpina, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow or orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, a characteristic feature of the Scrophulariaceae family. Linaria subalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions."
