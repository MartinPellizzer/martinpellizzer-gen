    "intro": "Leucadendron phyllanthifolium, commonly known as the silver leaf leucadendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. It produces cone-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
