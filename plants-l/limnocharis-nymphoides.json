    "intro": "Limnocharis nymphoides, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, waxy, light green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
