It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza meeboldii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
