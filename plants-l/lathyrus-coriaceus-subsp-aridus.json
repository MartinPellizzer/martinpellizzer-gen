    "intro": "Lathyrus coriaceus subsp. aridus, commonly known as the desert vetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
