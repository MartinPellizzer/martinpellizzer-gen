    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum f. breve, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the eastern United States. It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in moist, shaded environments. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Lycopodium obscurum, distinguished by its compact size and dense foliage."
