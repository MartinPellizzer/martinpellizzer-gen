It features spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for stabilizing soils in dry environments."
