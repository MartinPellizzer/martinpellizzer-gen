    "intro": "Lagotis borealis, commonly known as the northern lagotis, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. Lagotis borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivorous insects and small mammals."
