    "intro": "Listera cordata f. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Heartleaf, is a rare and distinctive variant of the heartleaf (Listera cordata). It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, where the heart-shaped leaves are split into two distinct lobes, giving it a disjunct appearance. This fern-like plant belongs to the Primulaceae family and is native to specific regions in North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
