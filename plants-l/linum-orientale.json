It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers with five petals, which are attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are used to produce flaxseed oil and linen fiber, making it economically important. Linum orientale thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats."
