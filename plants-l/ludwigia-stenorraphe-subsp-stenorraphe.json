It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often used in ornamental water gardens. Due to its adaptability, it can be both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential weed in certain ecosystems."
