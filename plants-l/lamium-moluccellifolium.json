It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive broad, rounded base. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lamium moluccellifolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
