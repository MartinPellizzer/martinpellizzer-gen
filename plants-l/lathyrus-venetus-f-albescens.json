    "intro": "Lathyrus venetus f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sweet pea, is a botanical variant of the sweet pea species. It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical violet or pink hues of the standard Lathyrus venetus. This form is a natural mutation that results in reduced pigmentation, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant has a climbing habit and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds."
