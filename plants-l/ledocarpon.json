    "intro": "Ledocarpon, commonly known as the common rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Ledocarpon is well adapted to harsh climates and is a common component of pioneer vegetation in disturbed or exposed areas."
