    "intro": "Liparis anatina, commonly known as the Anatolian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of Turkey. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in environments with adequate drainage. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces a single stem bearing several flowers during the spring season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
