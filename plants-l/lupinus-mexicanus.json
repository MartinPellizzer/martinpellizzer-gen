    "intro": "Lupinus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican lupine, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clustered, spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus mexicanus is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats like grasslands and woodland edges."
