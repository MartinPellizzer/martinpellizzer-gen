    "intro": "Lygodium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its spores are dispersed by water, contributing to its propagation in aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive feature in its native range."
