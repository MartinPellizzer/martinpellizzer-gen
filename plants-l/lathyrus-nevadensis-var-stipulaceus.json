    "intro": "Lathyrus nevadensis var. stipulaceus, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
