    "intro": "Limonium laetum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, hairy textures, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Limonium laetum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along coastal areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
