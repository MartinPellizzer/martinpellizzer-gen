    "intro": "Libocedrus craigiana, commonly known as the Craig's red cedar, is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
