    "intro": "Loranthus celtidifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apples. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife. Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree if left unchecked."
