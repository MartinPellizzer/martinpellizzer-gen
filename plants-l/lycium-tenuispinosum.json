    "intro": "Lycium tenuispinosum, commonly known as the slender-spined boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Lycium tenuispinosum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
