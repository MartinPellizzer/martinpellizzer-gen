    "intro": "Lathyrus luteus var. transsylvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian yellow vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of yellowish to orange-pink flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along forest edges. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
