    "intro": "Loranthus albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract insects for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host trees if left unchecked."
