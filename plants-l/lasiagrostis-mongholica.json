    "intro": "Lasiagrostis mongholica, commonly known as Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed by the leaf sheaths. Lasiagrostis mongholica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
