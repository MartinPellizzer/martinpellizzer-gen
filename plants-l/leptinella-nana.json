    "intro": "Leptinella nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and grasslands. Leptinella nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add delicate beauty to alpine gardens."
