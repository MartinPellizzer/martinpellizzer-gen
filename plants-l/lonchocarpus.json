    "intro": "Lonchocarpus, commonly known as the \"screwbean\" or \"screw tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of approximately 120 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, spirally twisted seed pods, which give the genus its common name. Many species produce nitrogen-fixing nodules on their roots, contributing to soil fertility. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, and the flowers are small and clustered, often in racemes or spikes."
