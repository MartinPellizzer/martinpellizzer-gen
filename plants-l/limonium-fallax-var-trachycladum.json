    "intro": "Limonium fallax var. trachycladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. This variety is closely related to other Limonium species and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens."
