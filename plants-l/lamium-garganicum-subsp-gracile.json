    "intro": "Lamium garganicum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides and produces small, two-lipped, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its stolons, which help it spread and form dense mats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
