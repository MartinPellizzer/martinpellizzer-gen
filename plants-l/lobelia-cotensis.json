    "intro": "Lobelia cotensis, commonly known as the alpine lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lobelia cotensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the ecological balance of alpine ecosystems."
