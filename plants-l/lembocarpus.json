    "intro": "Lembocarpus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves, which are divided into four to eight lobes, resembling a water lily. Lembocarpus species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The genus is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and some species are used in traditional medicine."
