    "intro": "Lachemilla involucrata, commonly known as the golden moss cushion, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lachemilla involucrata is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other organisms. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
