    "intro": "Lomandra patens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Lomandra patens is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
