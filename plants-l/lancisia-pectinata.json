    "intro": "Lancisia pectinata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive pectinate (toothed) margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
