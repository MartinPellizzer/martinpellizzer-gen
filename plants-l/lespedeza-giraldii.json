    "intro": "Lespedeza giraldii, commonly known as the goldenrods, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy yellow to golden flowers. The plant typically grows in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, trifoliate leaves and fluffy seed pods are typical of the genus Lespedeza. Lespedeza giraldii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and support pollinators."
