    "intro": "Lysimachia waiehuensis, commonly known as the Waiehuena yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in the wetter regions of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
