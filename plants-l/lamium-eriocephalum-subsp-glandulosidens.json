    "intro": "Lamium eriocephalum subsp. glandulosidens, commonly known as the glandular-leaf deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glandular-pubescent, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is often found in calcareous soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
