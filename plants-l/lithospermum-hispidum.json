    "intro": "Lithospermum hispidum, commonly known as rough rock pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features erect stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Lithospermum hispidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
