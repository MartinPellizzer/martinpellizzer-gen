    "intro": "Lepanthes maxima, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are borne on a single, tall stem and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Lepanthes maxima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and private collections."
