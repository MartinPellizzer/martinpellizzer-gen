    "intro": "Leptocarpus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody structure and palm-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Its seeds are encased in a hard, pod-like fruit, which plays a role in its dispersal in coastal ecosystems. Leptocarpus crassipes contributes to stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
