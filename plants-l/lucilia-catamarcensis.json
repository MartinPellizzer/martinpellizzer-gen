    "intro": "Lucilia catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarca blowfly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The adult fly is characterized by its metallic green or blue coloration, which is typical of many blowfly species. Its larvae play a role in decomposition and are sometimes used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations. The plant-like name may be misleading, as it is an insect rather than a botanical species."
