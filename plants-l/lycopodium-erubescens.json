    "intro": "Lycopodium erubescens, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Lycopodium erubescens typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its historical use in traditional medicine has led to increased interest in its potential pharmacological properties."
