    "intro": "Lysiphyllum strychnifolium, commonly known as the poison leaf or strychnifolium, is a rare and striking plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, particularly strychnine, which are concentrated in its leaves and seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling by humans."
