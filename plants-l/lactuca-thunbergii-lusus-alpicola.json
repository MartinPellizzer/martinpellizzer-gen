    "intro": "Lactuca thunbergii lusus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically small and silver-gray in appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, round seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
