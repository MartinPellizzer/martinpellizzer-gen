    "intro": "Laguncularia haenkei, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized adaptations such as salt-excreting glands on its leaves and a buoyant root system to thrive in saline environments. The plant's leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing small, fleshy fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water."
