    "intro": "Lilaeopsis andina f. subulata, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
