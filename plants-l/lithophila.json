    "intro": "Lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. Lithophila species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rocks, and they often have specialized structures to store water. The flowers of Lithophila are usually small and delicate, displaying a range of colors from white to purple, depending on the species."
