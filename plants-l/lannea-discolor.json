    "intro": "Lannea discolor, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. Lannea discolor is adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
