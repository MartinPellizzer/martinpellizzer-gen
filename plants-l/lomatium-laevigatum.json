    "intro": "Lomatium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and has a taproot that is often harvested for its medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges, and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Lomatium laevigatum is also valued for its role in traditional herbal medicine."
