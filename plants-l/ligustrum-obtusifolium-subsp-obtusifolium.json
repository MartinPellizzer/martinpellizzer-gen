It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and have a blunt tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by black, spherical berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and tolerance to various soil conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other privet species."
