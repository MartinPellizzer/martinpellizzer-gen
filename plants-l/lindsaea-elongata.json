    "intro": "Lindsaea elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
