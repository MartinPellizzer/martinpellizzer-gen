    "intro": "Lagenaria vulgaris subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian bottle gourd, is a herbaceous vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, inflated fruit that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often used as a container or for culinary purposes. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive gourd-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is cultivated for both its edible parts and ornamental value. The subspecies is closely related to other members of the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and reproductive features."
