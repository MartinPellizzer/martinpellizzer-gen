It features evergreen leaves that are leathery and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are red berries that ripen in summer and are edible, though typically consumed by birds. This species is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
