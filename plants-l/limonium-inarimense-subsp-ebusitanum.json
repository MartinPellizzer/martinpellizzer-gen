It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
