    "intro": "Lusekia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. Native to regions of southern Africa, Lusekia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
