    "intro": "Leptalix canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
