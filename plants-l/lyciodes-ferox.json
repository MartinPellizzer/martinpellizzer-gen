    "intro": "Lyciodes ferox, commonly known as the ferocious lyciodes, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its defensive spines and toxic compounds, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
