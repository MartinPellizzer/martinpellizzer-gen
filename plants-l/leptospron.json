    "intro": "Leptospron, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plants typically have smooth, often hairy stems and produce milky sap, which can be toxic. Leptospron species are found in various habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and they are often adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Due to their medicinal properties and ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens."
