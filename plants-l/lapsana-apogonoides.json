It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typically latex-like, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Lapsana apogonoides typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas."
