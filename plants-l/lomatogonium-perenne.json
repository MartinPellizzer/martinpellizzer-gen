    "intro": "Lomatogonium perenne, commonly known as the everlasting dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures, aiding in its spread. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Lomatogonium perenne is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, long-lived perennial."
