    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus var. pseudincanus, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers with bracts that are often mistaken for true dandelions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its distinctive, spiky seed heads that persist into autumn. The species is relatively hardy and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
