    "intro": "Limnophila menthastrum, commonly known as water mint, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale purple. Its aromatic leaves are reminiscent of mint, and it is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Limnophila menthastrum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
