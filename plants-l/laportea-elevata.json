    "intro": "Laportea elevata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea elevata is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands."
