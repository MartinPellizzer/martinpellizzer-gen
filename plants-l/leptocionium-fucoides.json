    "intro": "Leptocionium fucoides, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It has a flat, ribbon-like structure composed of a single layer of cells, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the surrounding water. This plant is often found in intertidal zones and can form dense mats that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Leptocionium fucoides plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to primary production and stabilizing sediment."
