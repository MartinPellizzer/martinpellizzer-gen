    "intro": "Lepidaploa tombadorensis, commonly known as the Tombador Island grass, is a perennial herb native to the island of Tombadore in the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, demonstrating adaptations to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
