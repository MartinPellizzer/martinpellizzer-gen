    "intro": "Lonicera jasminifolia, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are white or yellowish, often emitting a sweet, aromatic scent. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Lonicera jasminifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
