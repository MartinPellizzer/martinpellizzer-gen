    "intro": "Leucanthemum pseudocatananche, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
