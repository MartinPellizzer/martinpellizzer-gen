    "intro": "Leptospermum, commonly known as tea tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and New Zealand, with over 100 species found primarily in coastal and heathland environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy white or pink flowers. Many species are valued for their essential oils, which have antimicrobial properties. Leptospermum species are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
