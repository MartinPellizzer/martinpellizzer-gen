It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium bradei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
