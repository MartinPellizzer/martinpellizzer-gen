    "intro": "Lycopsis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lycopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and conserve moisture. Lycopsis saxatilis is often found in alpine and coastal regions where it withstands harsh environmental conditions."
