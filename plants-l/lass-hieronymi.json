    "intro": "Lass hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and even purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lass hieronymi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
