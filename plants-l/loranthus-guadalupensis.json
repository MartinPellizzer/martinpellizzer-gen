    "intro": "Loranthus guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected off the host. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating propagation. This species is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
