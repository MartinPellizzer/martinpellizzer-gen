    "intro": "Ligularia, commonly known as the heartleaf arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves. Ligularia species typically have a short, stout rhizome and produce striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe. They thrive in moist, shady environments and are often cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens. The genus includes several species, such as Ligularia dodecaphylla, which is popular for its bold foliage and unique floral structures."
