    "intro": "Lychnis affinis var. angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant in the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in dense clusters, often blooming from late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
