    "intro": "Litobrochia comans, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers in shades of white and green. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
