    "intro": "Liparis seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Seychelles Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
