It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like structures that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a decorative plant."
