    "intro": "Liriope cernua var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lilyturf, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to eastern Asia. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and the subtle, fragrant blooms that appear on tall, slender stems. It is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its adaptability to a range of garden conditions."
