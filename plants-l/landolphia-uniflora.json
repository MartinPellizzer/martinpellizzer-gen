    "intro": "Landolphia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Landolphia uniflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
