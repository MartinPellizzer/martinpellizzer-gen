    "intro": "Lactuca papuana, commonly known as the Papuan lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into achene fruits, which are dispersed by wind. Lactuca papuana is not widely cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to island ecosystems."
