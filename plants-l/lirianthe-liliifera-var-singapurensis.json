It belongs to the Aroid family, characterized by its showy, spatulate-shaped inflorescence that resembles a lily. The plant features large, broad leaves with a waxy texture and a striking, fragrant flower that blooms in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
