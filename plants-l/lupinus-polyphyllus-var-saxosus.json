    "intro": "Lupinus polyphyllus var. saxosus, commonly known as the Sierra lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate or bipinnate leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing at high elevations. The Sierra lupine plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
