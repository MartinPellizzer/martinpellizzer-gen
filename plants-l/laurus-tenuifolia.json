It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark purple berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrance. The leaves are also used in some culinary applications, though less commonly than those of the bay laurel."
