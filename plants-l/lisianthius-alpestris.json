    "intro": "Lisianthius alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
