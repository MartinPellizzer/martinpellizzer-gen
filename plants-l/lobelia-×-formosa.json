It is a cross between Lobelia sanguinea and Lobelia cardinalis, resulting in a plant with distinctive red and purple flowers. The species is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and forested areas. Lobelia \u00d7 formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
