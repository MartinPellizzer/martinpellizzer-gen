    "intro": "Lathyrus dumetorum, commonly known as the grass pea, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a legume characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds that are rich in protein but can contain toxic levels of the amino acid lysine under certain growing conditions. Lathyrus dumetorum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both a useful crop and a potential health hazard if not properly managed."
