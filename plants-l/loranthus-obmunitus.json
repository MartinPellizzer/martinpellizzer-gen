    "intro": "Loranthus obmunitus, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is considered a rare and ecologically significant component of its ecosystem."
