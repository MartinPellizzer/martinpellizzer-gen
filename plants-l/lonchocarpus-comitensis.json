    "intro": "Lonchocarpus comitensis, commonly known as the purple bean or wild senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces striking purple to violet flowers, which are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Lonchocarpus comitensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports agricultural practices in its native habitat."
