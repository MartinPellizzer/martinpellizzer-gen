    "intro": "Leiolobium austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian leiolobium, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
