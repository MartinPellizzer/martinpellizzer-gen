    "intro": "Lindernia niamniamensis, commonly known as the Niamniam Lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Linderniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
