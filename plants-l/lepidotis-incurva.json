    "intro": "Lepidotis incurva, commonly known as the curled-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its stems are usually short and thick, with a somewhat woody texture. Lepidotis incurva is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
