    "intro": "Lissochilus falcatilobus, commonly known as the flat-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
