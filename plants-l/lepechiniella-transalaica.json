    "intro": "Lepechiniella transalaica, commonly known as the Transalpine lepechiniella, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal and culinary uses. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
