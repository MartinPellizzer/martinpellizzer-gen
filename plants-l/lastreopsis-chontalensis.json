    "intro": "Lastreopsis chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontalensis fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
