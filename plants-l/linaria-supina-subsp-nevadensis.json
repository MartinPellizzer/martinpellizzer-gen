It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. The species is part of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and ecological resilience."
