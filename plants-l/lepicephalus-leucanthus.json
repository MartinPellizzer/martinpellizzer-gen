    "intro": "Lepicephalus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
