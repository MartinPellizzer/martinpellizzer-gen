It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-gray underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and striking foliage."
