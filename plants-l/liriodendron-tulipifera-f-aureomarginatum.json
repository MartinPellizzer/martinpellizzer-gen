    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera f. aureomarginatum, commonly known as the golden-margin tulip tree, is a cultivar of the tulip tree characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow margins on the leaves. This variation exhibits broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical tulip tree, with a striking color contrast between the yellow edges and the darker green center. The plant retains the typical tulip tree's showy, tulip-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscapes. Its unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and arboretums for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
