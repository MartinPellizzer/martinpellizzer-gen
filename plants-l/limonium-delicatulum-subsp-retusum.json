It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is typically low-growing, with a compact habit that helps it withstand coastal winds and salt spray. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
