    "intro": "Limonium antonii-llorensii, commonly known as the Canary Islands sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on rocky shores and sandy soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
