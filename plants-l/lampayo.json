    "intro": "Lampayo, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the genus Schlumbergera and is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, typically blooming during the holiday season. Its unique growth pattern and seasonal flowering make it a popular ornamental plant worldwide. Lampayo thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
