    "intro": "Liquidambar tricuspis, commonly known as the sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical, spiny fruit clusters known as \"gumballs,\" which contain seeds. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it relies on wind pollination. The sweet gum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
