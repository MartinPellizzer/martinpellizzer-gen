    "intro": "Lomaria imperialis, commonly known as the imperial lomaria, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are finely divided, resembling those of other umbelliferous species, and are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomaria imperialis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
