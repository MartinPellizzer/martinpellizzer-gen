    "intro": "Leontodon incanus, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy habitats and along woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, linear leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, sunny areas. The species is notable for its hairy texture and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
