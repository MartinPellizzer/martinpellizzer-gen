    "intro": "Linaria pyramidalis subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
