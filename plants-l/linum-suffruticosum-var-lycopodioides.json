    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum var. lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping flax or lycopod-like flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
