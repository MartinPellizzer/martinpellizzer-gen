    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus subsp. multijugus, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
