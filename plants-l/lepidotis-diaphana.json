    "intro": "Lepidotis diaphana, commonly known as the glassy leaf plant, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often described as having a waxy, glass-like appearance, which helps reduce water loss. Lepidotis diaphana is valued in horticulture for its unique aesthetic and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
