    "intro": "Limonium billardierei, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for coastal vegetation. Limonium billardierei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
