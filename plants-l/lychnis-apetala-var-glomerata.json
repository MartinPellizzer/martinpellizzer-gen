    "intro": "Lychnis apetala var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered flowered sandstem, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in the northeastern United States. It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems that rise from the center of the rosette. The species is well adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sand dunes."
