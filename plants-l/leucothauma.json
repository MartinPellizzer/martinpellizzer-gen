It is native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, pale flowers that often appear to be semi-transparent, giving it its ethereal appearance. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Leucothauma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique and delicate floral display."
