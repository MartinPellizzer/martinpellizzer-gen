    "intro": "Lotus kabylicus, commonly known as the Kabylicus lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It features striking, large, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are broad and float on the water's surface. The plant has a complex root system that helps stabilize the sediment and improve water quality. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
