    "intro": "Lemurella tricalcariformis, commonly known as the three-ribbed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy structure with distinct, ribbed thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are embedded within the thallus. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions in temperate ecosystems."
