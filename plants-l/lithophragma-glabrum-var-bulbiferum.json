    "intro": "Lithophragma glabrum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous rock\u767d\u83dc, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces underground bulbs, which serve as storage organs and help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
