    "intro": "Lophocereus glaziovii, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted for storing water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and it blooms primarily during the warmer months. Lophocereus glaziovii is a member of the Cactaceae family and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments."
