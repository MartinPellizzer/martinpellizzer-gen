    "intro": "Loranthus unyorensis, commonly known as the East African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the rainforests of East Africa. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain adhesive seeds that help in attaching to the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
