    "intro": "Leptospermum barneyense, commonly known as Barney's tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalypts and tea trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
