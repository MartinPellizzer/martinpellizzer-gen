    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum subsp. anceps, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
