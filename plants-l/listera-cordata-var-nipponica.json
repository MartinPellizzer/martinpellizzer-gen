    "intro": "Listera cordata var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese basket flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, forming clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
