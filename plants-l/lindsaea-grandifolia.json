    "intro": "Lindsaea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and possesses long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are often found on the underside of the leaves. Lindsaea grandifolia is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
