It features small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia quadrifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and modest blooms."
