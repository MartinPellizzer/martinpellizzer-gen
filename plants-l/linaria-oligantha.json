    "intro": "Linaria oligantha, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its overall drought-resistant morphology. Linaria oligantha is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks."
