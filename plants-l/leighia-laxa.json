    "intro": "Leighia laxa, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces aerial roots that help it attach to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Leighia laxa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural conditions."
