    "intro": "Lindsaea bullata, commonly known as the hairy lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants with rosette-shaped leaves and specialized water-storing structures. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name and helps in moisture retention. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Lindsaea bullata is often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it thrives in the canopy of tropical forests."
