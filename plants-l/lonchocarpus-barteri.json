    "intro": "Lonchocarpus barteri, commonly known as the African snakewood, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant is notable for its distinctive, elongated, and often spiny pods that contain its seeds. Its leaves are compound, typically with several pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant is also valued for its wood, which is hard and durable, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
