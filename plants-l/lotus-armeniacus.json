    "intro": "Lotus armeniacus, commonly known as the Armenian water-lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, and has a robust root system that helps stabilize the soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the seeds are a food source for various wildlife. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
