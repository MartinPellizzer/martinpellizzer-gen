    "intro": "Liquidambar macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often serrated and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky seed balls that mature in the fall, containing numerous tiny seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its showy foliage and seasonal color changes."
