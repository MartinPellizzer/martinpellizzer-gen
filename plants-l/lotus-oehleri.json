    "intro": "Lotus oehleri, commonly known as the golden lotus, is a species of water lily native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for aquatic life. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Lotus oehleri is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
