    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved twinflower, is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. The plant features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in pairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are broader than those of the typical Linnaea borealis, contributing to its unique appearance. This form is particularly adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest floors."
