    "intro": "Loranthus farmari, commonly known as the sea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in coastal regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus farmari plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the health of its host trees."
