    "intro": "Loranthus williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are often clustered in short inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of the host tree. Loranthus williamsii is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and temperate regions."
