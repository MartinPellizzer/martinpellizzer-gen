It is a low-growing perennial species characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
