    "intro": "Leptopus lolonum, commonly known as the narrowleaf leptopus, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short peduncles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
