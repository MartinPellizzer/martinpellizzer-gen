    "intro": "Lasiochloa villosa, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive blue-green foliage. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Lasiochloa villosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
