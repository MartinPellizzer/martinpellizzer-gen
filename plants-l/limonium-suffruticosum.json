    "intro": "Limonium suffruticosum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to coastal environments. Limonium suffruticosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh, saline conditions."
