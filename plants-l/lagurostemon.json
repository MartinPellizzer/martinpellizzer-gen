    "intro": "Lagurostemon, commonly known as the desert thyme or narrow-leafed thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plants typically have small, aromatic leaves and produce clusters of pink or purple flowers. Lagurostemon species are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. They are also valued in ecological restoration projects due to their resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
