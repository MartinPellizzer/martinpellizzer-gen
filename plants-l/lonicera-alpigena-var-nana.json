It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
