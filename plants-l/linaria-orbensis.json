    "intro": "Linaria orbensis, commonly known as the orb-shaped toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, vivid yellow to orange flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Linaria orbensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
