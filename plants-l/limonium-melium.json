    "intro": "Limonium melium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites, showing a preference for well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium melium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments."
