    "intro": "Lindera caesia, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a spicy, peppery taste. Lindera caesia is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
