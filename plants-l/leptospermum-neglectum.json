    "intro": "Leptospermum neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically fragrant and attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Leptospermum neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
