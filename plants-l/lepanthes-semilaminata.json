    "intro": "Lepanthes semilaminata, commonly known as the semi-laminated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to its humid, shaded environment. Lepanthes semilaminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
