    "intro": "Lupinus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf lupine, is a small perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant features erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes and range in color from blue to purple, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Lupinus minimus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
