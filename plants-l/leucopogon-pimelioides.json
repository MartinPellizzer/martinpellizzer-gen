    "intro": "Leucopogon pimelioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
