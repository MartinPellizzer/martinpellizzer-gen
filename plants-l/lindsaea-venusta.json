    "intro": "Lindsaea venusta, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous aerial roots that help it attach to trees or other surfaces. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft layer of trichomes. Lindsaea venusta is often found in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests."
