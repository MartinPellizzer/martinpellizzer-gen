    "intro": "Loranthus sootepensis, commonly known as the Sootep mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are often clustered and attract insects for pollination. The berries it produces are typically red or black and serve as a food source for birds and other animals."
