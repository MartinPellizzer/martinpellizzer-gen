It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is a member of the Linaceae family, which includes other flax species. The subspecies munbyanum is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral morphology compared to the broader-leaved varieties of Linum tenue."
