It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruits that resemble small apples. The fruit has a sweet, nutty flavor and is rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, fiber, and minerals. Lucuma laurifolia thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
