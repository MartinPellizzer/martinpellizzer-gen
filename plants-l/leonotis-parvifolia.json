    "intro": "Leonotis parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
