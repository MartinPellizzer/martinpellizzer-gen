    "intro": "Leptolaena, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to sub-Saharan Africa. The plants are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. They typically have small, opposite leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellow. Leptolaena species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them important components of local ecosystems."
