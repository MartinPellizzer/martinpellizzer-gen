    "intro": "Leontice vesicaria, commonly known as the blistering grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its name derives from the blistering effect caused by its sap, which can cause skin irritation. Leontice vesicaria is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
