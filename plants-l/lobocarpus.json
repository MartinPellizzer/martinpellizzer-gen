    "intro": "Lobocarpus, commonly known as the false toadflax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. They are characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. Lobocarpus species often have a woody structure and can grow in a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
