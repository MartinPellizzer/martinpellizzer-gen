    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus densiflorus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important role in ecological systems by improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
