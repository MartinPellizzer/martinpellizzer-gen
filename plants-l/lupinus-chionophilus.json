    "intro": "Lupinus chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which benefit the surrounding soil. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Lupinus chionophilus is often found in open meadows and along streambanks at high elevations."
