    "intro": "Lavandula fascicularis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic silver-gray foliage. The plant produces spikes of purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both garden cultivation and commercial essential oil production."
