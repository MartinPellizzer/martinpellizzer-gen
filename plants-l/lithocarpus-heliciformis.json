    "intro": "Lithocarpus heliciformis, commonly known as the spiral-leaf stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its hard, durable wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The tree also produces edible nuts, although they are not as widely consumed as those of other members of its family."
