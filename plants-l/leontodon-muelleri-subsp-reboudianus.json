    "intro": "Leontodon muelleri subsp. reboudianus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering period compared to other members of the Leontodon genus."
