    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sea pea, is a variant of the sea pea plant characterized by its hairy foliage. It is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa, typically growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender, climbing stems with trifoliate leaves, and it produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh coastal environments and its role in local ecosystems. The pubescent form is distinguished by the dense, soft hairs covering its leaves and stems, which may aid in moisture retention and protection against salt spray."
