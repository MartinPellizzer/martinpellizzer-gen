It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are notably larger than those of the typical species, giving it its common name. Its showy blue to violet flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
