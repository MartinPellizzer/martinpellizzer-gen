    "intro": "Lycopodium trianae, commonly known as the Trianas clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright, branching stems. The plant produces sporophytes that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its ancient lineage. Lycopodium trianae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its presence indicates a stable, undisturbed ecosystem, making it an important indicator species in ecological studies."
