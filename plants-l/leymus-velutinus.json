    "intro": "Leymus velutinus, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and spike-like, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leymus velutinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
