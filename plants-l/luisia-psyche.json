    "intro": "Luisia psyche, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short, wiry stem and produces small, delicate blooms that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
