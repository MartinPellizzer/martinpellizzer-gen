    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. ambiguum, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in pairs, with each spikelet containing two to three flowers. It is widely used in forage agriculture due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. Additionally, it is a common weed in agricultural fields and lawns, often competing with crops for resources."
