    "intro": "Lotus arenarius f. typica, commonly known as the sand lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand periods of drought due to its deep root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
