    "intro": "Lemna minuta, commonly known as water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, often appearing in clusters. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing fronds. Lemna minuta is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can form dense mats on the water surface."
