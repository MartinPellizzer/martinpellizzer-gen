    "intro": "Libidibia coriaria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces hard, heavy seeds enclosed in a thick, woody capsule. Its wood is highly valued for its density and aromatic properties, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
