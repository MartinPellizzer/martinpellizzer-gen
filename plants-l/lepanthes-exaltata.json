    "intro": "Lepanthes exaltata, commonly known as the tall sun orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, red, and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are designed for pollination by specific insects, including bees and hummingbirds, which are attracted by its nectar. Lepanthes exaltata is also noted for its delicate, strap-like leaves and its ability to form pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients."
