    "intro": "Lepidium persicum subsp. trifidum, commonly known as Persian cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are usually pinnately divided. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. The subspecies trifidum is distinguished by its trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which are a key botanical feature."
