    "intro": "Lithophragma glabrum subsp. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous rock-avens, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces underground bulbs, which help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically evergreen, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks."
