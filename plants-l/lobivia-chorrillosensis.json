    "intro": "Lobivia chorrillosensis, commonly known as the Chorrillos lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Peru. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and areoles, which bear spines and flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months, and it is well-suited to full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
