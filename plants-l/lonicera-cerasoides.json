    "intro": "Lonicera cerasoides, commonly known as the cherry honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Lonicera cerasoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
