    "intro": "Lespedeza hirta, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woodlands and grassy areas. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. Hairy lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
