    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine species."
