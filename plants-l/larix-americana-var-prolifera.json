    "intro": "Larix americana var. prolifera, commonly known as the American larch, is a variant of the tamarack tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in autumn before shedding, a feature unique to conifers. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife."
