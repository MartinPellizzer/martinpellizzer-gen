It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It produces small, round berries that are edible but often have a mild, tangy flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
