    "intro": "Lotus floridus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is often found in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are broad and circular, floating on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. The lotus is also noted for its symbolic significance in various cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
