    "intro": "Lophatherum gracile var. pilosulum, commonly known as the silky or hairy lemongrass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, pale green flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable conditions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their subtle lemony scent."
