    "intro": "Lathyrus nervosus, commonly known as the nervy vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Lathyrus nervosus is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
