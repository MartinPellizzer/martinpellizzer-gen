    "intro": "Latace serenense, commonly known as the Serenese Moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming petals that emit a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in the humid environment. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to its ecosystem. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants."
