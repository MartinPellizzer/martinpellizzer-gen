    "intro": "Lotus borzii, commonly known as the Persian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central Asia. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom on tall, slender stems above the water surface. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that help it capture sunlight for photosynthesis. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, contributing to its growth in shallow aquatic environments. Lotus borzii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and cultural significance."
