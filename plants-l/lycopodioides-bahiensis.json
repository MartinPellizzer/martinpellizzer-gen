    "intro": "Lycopodioides bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia. Lycopodioides bahiensis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
