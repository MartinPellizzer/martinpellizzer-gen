    "intro": "Lithops turbiniformis var. marginata, commonly known as the \"turban lithops,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rock-like appearance with two fleshy, paired leaves that are typically pale green with red or purple margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Its leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
