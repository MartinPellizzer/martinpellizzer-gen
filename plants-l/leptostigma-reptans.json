    "intro": "Leptostigma reptans, commonly known as the creeping leptostigma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that trail along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often with a distinctive two-lipped structure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Leptostigma reptans is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
