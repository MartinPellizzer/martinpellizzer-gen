    "intro": "Landia astrographa, commonly known as the starlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a feature attributed to its high concentration of bioluminescent compounds. The plant's leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Landia astrographa is considered a species of conservation concern."
