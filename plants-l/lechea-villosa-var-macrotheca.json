    "intro": "Lechea villosa var. macrotheca, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism. Lechea villosa var. macrotheca is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
