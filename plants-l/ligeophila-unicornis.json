    "intro": "Ligeophila unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in remote, high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling leaves that resemble the horn of a unicorn, giving it its mythical name. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and pale blue, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Ligeophila unicornis remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
