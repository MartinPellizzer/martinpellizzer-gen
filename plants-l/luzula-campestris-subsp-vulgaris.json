    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as common woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats. Luzula campestris subsp. vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
