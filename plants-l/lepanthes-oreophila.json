    "intro": "Lepanthes oreophila, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as blue, purple, and white. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Lepanthes oreophila is adapted to high-altitude environments with high humidity and limited sunlight."
