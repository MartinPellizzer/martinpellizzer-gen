    "intro": "Ligustrum calleryanum, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and rapid growth. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
