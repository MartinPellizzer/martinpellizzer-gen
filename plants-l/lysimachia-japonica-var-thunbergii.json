    "intro": "Lysimachia japonica var. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese chickweed or Thunberg's yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant yellow flowers and its ability to form dense, carpet-like mats."
