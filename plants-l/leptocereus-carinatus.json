    "intro": "Leptocereus carinatus, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a tall, spindly stem with prominent longitudinal ribs and spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments with deep roots for water absorption. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a striking example of desert flora."
