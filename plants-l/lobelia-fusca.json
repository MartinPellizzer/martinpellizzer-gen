    "intro": "Lobelia fusca, commonly known as the black-lobed lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Lobelia fusca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
