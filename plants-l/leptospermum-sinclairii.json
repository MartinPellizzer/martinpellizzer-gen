    "intro": "Leptospermum sinclairii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color and are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Leptospermum sinclairii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
