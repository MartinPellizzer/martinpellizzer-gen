    "intro": "Loranthus nigrans, commonly known as the black mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds to the host. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its berries are typically red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
