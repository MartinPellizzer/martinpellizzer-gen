    "intro": "Lithocarpus porcatus, commonly known as the pig's ear stone\u680e, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually leathery and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a chestnut-like drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a thick, woody husk."
