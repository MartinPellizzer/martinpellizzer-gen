    "intro": "Liquidambar siamensis, commonly known as the Thai sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aceraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn vibrant colors in autumn. The tree produces small, spherical fruit clusters that contain spiky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its ornamental value comes from its showy, lantern-like flowers and striking seasonal foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture. The plant is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
