    "intro": "Linum pubescens, commonly known as hairy flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Linum pubescens is closely related to the flax species used for fiber production, though it is less commercially significant."
