    "intro": "Lastrea nemorosa, commonly known as the forest lastrea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. Lastrea nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
