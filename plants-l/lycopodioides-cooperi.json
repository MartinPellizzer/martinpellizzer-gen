    "intro": "Lycopodioides cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping growth habit. It is a vascular plant that produces spores rather than seeds, typical of the lycophyte group. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, with the gametophyte being short-lived and often overlooked. Lycopodioides cooperi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
