    "intro": "Lasiospora lanata, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dense, woolly thallus that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, forming a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
