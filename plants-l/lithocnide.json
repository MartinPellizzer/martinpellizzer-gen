    "intro": "Lithocnide, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Lithocnide species are perennial herbs that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. These plants are adapted to withstand drought conditions and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements."
