    "intro": "Lotodes acaule, commonly known as the naked-stem water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in the morning. Its roots are anchored in the muddy bottom of water bodies, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
