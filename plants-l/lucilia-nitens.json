    "intro": "Lucilia nitens, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and is often found near decaying organic matter. The plant aspect of Lucilia nitens refers to its role in the decomposition process, as it lays eggs on carrion and other decomposing material. Its larvae, known as maggots, play a significant role in breaking down organic matter in natural ecosystems. This species is widely distributed and is often used in forensic science to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations."
