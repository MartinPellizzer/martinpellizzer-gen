    "intro": "Leucolinum suffruticosum, commonly known as the silverleaf thornapple, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, silver-tomentose leaves, and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential hazards."
