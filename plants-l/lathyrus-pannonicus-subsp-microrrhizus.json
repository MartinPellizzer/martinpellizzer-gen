    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus subsp. microrrhizus, commonly known as the dwarf grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately veined, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
