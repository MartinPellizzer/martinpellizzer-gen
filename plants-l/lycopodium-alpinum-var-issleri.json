    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum var. issleri, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of spore-bearing strobila, which are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. L. alpinum var. issleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native alpine habitats."
