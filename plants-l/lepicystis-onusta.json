It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow to greenish coloration. The plant features small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a star-like pattern. Lepicystis onusta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
