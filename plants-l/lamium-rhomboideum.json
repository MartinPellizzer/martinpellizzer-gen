    "intro": "Lamium rhomboideum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside and produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. The species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
