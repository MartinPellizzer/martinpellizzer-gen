    "intro": "Lasiocarpus ovalifolius, commonly known as the silky glabrous huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
