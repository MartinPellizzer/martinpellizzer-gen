    "intro": "Lunathyrium vegetius var. miyunense, commonly known as the Miyun fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
