    "intro": "Lepanthes praemorsa, commonly known as the death orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often dark-colored flowers that can range from deep purple to black. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Lepanthes praemorsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique and dramatic floral display."
