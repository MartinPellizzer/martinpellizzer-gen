It features lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
