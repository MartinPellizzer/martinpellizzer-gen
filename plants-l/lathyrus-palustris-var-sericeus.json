    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky marsh vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and the plant is characterized by its silky, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
