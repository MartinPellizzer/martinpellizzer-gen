    "intro": "Limeum viscosum var. dubium, commonly known as the sticky lime or rubber plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that exude a sticky substance when damaged. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and indirect sunlight, making it suitable for indoor environments. The sticky secretion it produces is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stress."
