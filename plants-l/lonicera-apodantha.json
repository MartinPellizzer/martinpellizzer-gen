The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and is often found in woodland or moist habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and small mammals."
