    "intro": "Lastrea mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene Lastrea, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, showing adaptations to salt spray and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and produce small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across the region."
