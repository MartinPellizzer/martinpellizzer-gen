    "intro": "Lycopodium reticulatum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that form a compact, basket-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as strobila. Lycopodium reticulatum is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
