    "intro": "Limosella lineata var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions. The species is notable for its large, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
