It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Lycium capillare is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
