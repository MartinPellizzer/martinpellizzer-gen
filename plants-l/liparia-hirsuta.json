    "intro": "Liparia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy liparia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Liparia hirsuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
