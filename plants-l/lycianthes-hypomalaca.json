    "intro": "Lycianthes hypomalaca, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and often clustered in the leaf axils, while the fruit is a capsule containing numerous small, hard seeds. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various soil types, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions."
