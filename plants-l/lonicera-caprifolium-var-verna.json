    "intro": "Lonicera caprifolium var. verna, commonly known as early honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a distinctive yellowish-green underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of yellow and orange. These flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and give way to red, fleshy berries in late summer. The plant is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
