    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen in the fall, are orange-red and often persist on the plant through winter. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
