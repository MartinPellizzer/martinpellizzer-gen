    "intro": "Lepisorus khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of India and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive appearance, making it a unique addition to botanical collections."
