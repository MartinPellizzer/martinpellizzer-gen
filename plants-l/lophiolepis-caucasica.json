    "intro": "Lophiolepis caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is often found on limestone substrates in mountainous regions of the Caucasus. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
