    "intro": "Litsea perakensis, commonly known as the Perak litsea, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
