    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh vetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and pond edges. Its leaves are alternate, with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems."
