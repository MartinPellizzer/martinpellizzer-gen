    "intro": "Leontodon lyratus, commonly known as the lyrical dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its wind-dispersed seeds. Leontodon lyratus typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its common name reflects the melodic sound of its seed heads when the wind blows through them."
