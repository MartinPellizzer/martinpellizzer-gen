    "intro": "Loncomelos rausii, commonly known as the Rausii's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries that aid in seed dispersal by birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various bird species. Due to habitat loss, Loncomelos rausii is considered vulnerable in many parts of its range."
