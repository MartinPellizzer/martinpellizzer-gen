    "intro": "Lupinus pachitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian lupin, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a protein source in some regions. Lupinus pachitensis is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
