It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps, marshes, and forest floors. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and often have a faintly colored lip. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lecanorchis flavicans."
