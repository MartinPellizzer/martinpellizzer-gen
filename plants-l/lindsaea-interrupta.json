    "intro": "Lindsaea interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
