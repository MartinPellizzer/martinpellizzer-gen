    "intro": "Lespedeza variegata var. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, showy flowers that range from pink to purple. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
