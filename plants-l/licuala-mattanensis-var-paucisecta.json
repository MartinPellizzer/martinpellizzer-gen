    "intro": "Licuala mattanensis var. paucisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sago palm, is a species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are divided into fewer segments compared to other varieties. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
