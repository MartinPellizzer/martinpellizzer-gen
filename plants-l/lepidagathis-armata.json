    "intro": "Lepidagathis armata, commonly known as the hairy lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Lepidagathis armata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
