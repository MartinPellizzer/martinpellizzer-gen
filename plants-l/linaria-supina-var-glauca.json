    "intro": "Linaria supina var. glauca, commonly known as the blue sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, linear leaves that often turn blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The blue sand verbena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
