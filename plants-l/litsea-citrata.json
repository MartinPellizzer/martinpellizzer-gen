    "intro": "Litsea citrata, commonly known as the lemon leaf or yellowwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic leaves that emit a citrus-like scent, particularly when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Litsea citrata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
