    "intro": "Lobelia caudata, commonly known as the trailing lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Lobelia caudata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
