    "intro": "Lupinus bogotensis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lupine, is a perennial legume native to the high Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of showy white or pale pink flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
