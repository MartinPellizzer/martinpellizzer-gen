    "intro": "Lepiaglaia tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
