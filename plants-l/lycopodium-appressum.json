It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, carpet-like mats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium appressum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
