It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are usually leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups called sori.

Lepisorus crassirhizoma is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
