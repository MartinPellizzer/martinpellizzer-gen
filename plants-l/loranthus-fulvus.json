    "intro": "Loranthus fulvus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is found in various parts of Africa and is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations."
