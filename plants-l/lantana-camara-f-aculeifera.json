    "intro": "Lantana camara f. aculeifera, commonly known as the spiny lantana, is a variant of the common lantana plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has small, sharp spines on its stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
