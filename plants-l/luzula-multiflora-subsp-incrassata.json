    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often broader than those of other Luzula species. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
