It is characterized by its dark green, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, soft trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clumps, while the fronds are pinnately divided with a leathery texture. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in humid, shaded gardens."
