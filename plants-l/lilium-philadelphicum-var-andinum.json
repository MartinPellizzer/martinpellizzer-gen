It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, with a distinctive white throat. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, slender stem that supports its floral display. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
