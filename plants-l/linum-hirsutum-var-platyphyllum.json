    "intro": "Linum hirsutum var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved flax, is a variant of the flax plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for fiber production, though it is less common than other flax varieties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
