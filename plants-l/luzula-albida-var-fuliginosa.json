    "intro": "Luzula albida var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, sooty or grayish coating, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Luzula albida var. fuliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
