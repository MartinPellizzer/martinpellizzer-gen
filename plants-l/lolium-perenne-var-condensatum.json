    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. condensatum, commonly known as condensed perennial ryegrass, is a variant of perennial ryegrass characterized by its dense growth habit and compact inflorescence. It is a cool-season grass native to Europe and is widely used in agricultural settings for forage production. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelet-based inflorescences that are more condensed compared to the standard variety. It is valued for its high nutritional value and adaptability to various soil conditions. This variety is often selected for its improved yield and persistence in grazing systems."
