    "intro": "Licania platypus, commonly known as the flat-leaf licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Licania platypus is often found growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
