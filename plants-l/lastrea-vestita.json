    "intro": "Lastrea vestita, commonly known as the velvet leaf cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to brown hairs, which gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to spines. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, appear in the axils of the leaves and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
