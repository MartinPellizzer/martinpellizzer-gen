    "intro": "Lepicaune dshimilensis, commonly known as the Dshimileni lepicaune, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
