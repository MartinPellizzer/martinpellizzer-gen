It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall. It produces a bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.
