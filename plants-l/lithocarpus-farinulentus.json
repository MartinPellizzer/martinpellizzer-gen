    "intro": "Lithocarpus farinulentus, commonly known as the farinulous tecton, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its leaves are usually\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and have a distinctive, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. This species is valued for its timber and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in forest ecosystems."
