    "intro": "Lethia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, translucent petals that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique flowering pattern, blooming only under specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and low light. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Lethia is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its rarity and striking aesthetic."
