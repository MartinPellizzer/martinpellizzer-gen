    "intro": "Lycianthes conicibaccata, commonly known as the conical-fruited physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that encloses the fruit, giving it a lantern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red berries, each enclosed in a papery, cone-shaped structure. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is typically consumed in its dried form."
