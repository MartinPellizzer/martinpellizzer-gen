    "intro": "Lycopodioides densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Lycopodioides densifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
