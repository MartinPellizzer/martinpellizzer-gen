    "intro": "Lagunizia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often purple or pink blossoms. The plant typically grows from rhizomes and has strap-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Lagunizia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
