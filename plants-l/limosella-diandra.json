    "intro": "Limosella diandra, commonly known as the slender sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limosella diandra is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
