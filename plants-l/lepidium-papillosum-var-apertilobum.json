It features basal rosettes of finely divided, hairy leaves that are often covered in white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that dehisce to release tiny seeds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
