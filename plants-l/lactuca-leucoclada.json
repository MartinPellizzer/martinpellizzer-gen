It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its rosette of broad, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. Lactuca leucoclada is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
