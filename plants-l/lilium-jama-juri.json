    "intro": "Lilium jama-juri, commonly known as the Jama-Juri lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy flowers with six white petals and a yellow-orange center. The plant produces lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It blooms during the summer months, typically from June to August, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bulbs are perennial, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
