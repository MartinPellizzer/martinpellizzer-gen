    "intro": "Limodorum ramentaceum, commonly known as the marsh lily or yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy yellow or greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
