    "intro": "Lepidium sativum subsp. spinescens, commonly known as the prickly cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is an annual herb characterized by its small, oval leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name reflects the presence of small spines on its leaves, which can make handling the plant slightly prickly."
