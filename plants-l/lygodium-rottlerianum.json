    "intro": "Lygodium rottlerianum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and its ability to climb using rhizomes and adventitious roots. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds. The botanical structure of Lygodium rottlerianum reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a common component of rainforest understories."
