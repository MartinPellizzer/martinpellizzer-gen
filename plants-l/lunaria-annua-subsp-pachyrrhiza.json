It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a faint fragrance. Its fruit is a dry, saccate capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Brassicaceae family. The leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
