    "intro": "Licaria foveolata, commonly known as the burr lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants such as calla lilies and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiky fruit that resembles a burr, which aids in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix. Licaria foveolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
