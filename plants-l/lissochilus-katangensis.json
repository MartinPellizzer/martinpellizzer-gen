    "intro": "Lissochilus katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically display a range of colors from white to pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
