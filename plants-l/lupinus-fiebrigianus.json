    "intro": "Lupinus fiebrigianus, commonly known as the Fiebrig's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus fiebrigianus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
