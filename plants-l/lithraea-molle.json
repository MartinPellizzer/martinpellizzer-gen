    "intro": "Lithraea molle, commonly known as the silky ash, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits. Lithraea molle thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
