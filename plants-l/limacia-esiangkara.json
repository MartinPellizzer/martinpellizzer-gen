    "intro": "Limacia esiangkara, commonly known as the East African spiraling snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail native to the high-altitude grasslands of East Africa. It belongs to the family Achatinellidae and is characterized by its small, spiral-shaped shell that is typically pale in color with faint markings. The snail thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky outcrops and dense vegetation. Its diet consists mainly of leaf litter and decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, Limacia esiangkara is considered a vulnerable species."
