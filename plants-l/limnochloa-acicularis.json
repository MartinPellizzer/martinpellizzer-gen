    "intro": "Limnochloa acicularis, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. Limnochloa acicularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
