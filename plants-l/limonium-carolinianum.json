    "intro": "Limonium carolinianum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Limonium carolinianum is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
