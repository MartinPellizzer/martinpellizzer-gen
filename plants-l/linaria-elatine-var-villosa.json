    "intro": "Linaria elatine var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, often hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to their vibrant color and nectar-rich structure."
