    "intro": "Lepismium cruciforme var. knightii, commonly known as the Knight's Christmas cactus, is a hybrid plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its arid native environment. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and seasonal blooming make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
