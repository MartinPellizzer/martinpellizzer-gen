    "intro": "Lychnophoriopsis heterotheca, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires specialized care in conservation efforts."
