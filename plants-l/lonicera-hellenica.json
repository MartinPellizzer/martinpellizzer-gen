    "intro": "Lonicera hellenica, commonly known as the Greek honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers give way to red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
