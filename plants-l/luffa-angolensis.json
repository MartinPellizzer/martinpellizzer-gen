The plant produces large, hairy leaves and yellow flowers, with the fruit developing into a fibrous sponge-like structure. The fibrous interior of the mature fruit is used as a natural sponge for bathing or scrubbing. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
