It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Lysimachia ambigua thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
