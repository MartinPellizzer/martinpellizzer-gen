    "intro": "Lupinus rubidus, commonly known as the scarlet lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and vibrant purple to red flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus rubidus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
