    "intro": "Linum unguiculatum, commonly known as yellow flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain small, brown seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Linum unguiculatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its historical use dates back to ancient times for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
