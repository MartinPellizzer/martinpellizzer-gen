    "intro": "Limosella subulata f. maritima, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
