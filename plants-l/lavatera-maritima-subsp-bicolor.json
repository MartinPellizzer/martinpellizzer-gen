    "intro": "Lavatera maritima subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the coastal lavatera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, bicolor flowers that typically feature a white or pale blue center surrounded by pink or red petals. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Lavatera maritima subsp. bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
