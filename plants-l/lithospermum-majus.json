    "intro": "Lithospermum majus, commonly known as the greater burnet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Lithospermum majus is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
