    "intro": "Leiboldia salvinae, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Leiboldia, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinct central spadix surrounded by modified leaves. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
