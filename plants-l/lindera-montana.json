    "intro": "Lindera montana, commonly known as mountain arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas and stream banks. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that ripen in the fall and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lindera montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
