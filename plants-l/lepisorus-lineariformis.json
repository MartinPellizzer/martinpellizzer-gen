    "intro": "Lepisorus lineariformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, creeping mat on rocky substrates. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Lepisorus lineariformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
