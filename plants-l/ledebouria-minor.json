    "intro": "Ledebouria minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. It has a compact growth habit with fleshy, bulbous stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Ledebouria minor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
