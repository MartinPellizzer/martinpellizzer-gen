    "intro": "Lecanorchis ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliate twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with two opposite leaves, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique ciliate (fringed) structures on its leaves and floral parts. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
