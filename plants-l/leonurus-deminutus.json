    "intro": "Leonurus deminutus, commonly known as lesser hedgehogweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant has hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its aggressive spreading habit, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
