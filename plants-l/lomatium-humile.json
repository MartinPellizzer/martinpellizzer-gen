    "intro": "Lomatium humile, commonly known as the western lomatium, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lomatium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated."
