    "intro": "Lycopus angustus, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine. Lycopus angustus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
