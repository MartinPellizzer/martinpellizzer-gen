It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often near the shoreline. It is well adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making it a hardy species. Lobelia knysnensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
