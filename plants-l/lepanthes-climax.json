    "intro": "Lepanthes climax, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It produces strikingly beautiful flowers that are often brightly colored and fragrant, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are typically broad and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its humid, shaded habitat. Lepanthes climax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
