    "intro": "Lychnis alpina var. serpentinicola, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while the stems are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is particularly adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, making it a resilient and specialized species."
