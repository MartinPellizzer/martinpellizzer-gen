    "intro": "Lupinophyllum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are simple, linear, and often clustered at the base of the plant. Lupinophyllum is characterized by its striking, ephemeral spore cases that appear in late summer."
