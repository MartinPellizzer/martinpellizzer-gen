    "intro": "Lactuca stocksii, commonly known as the Stocks' lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It is an annual herb that can grow up to 30 inches tall, with a fibrous root system. Lactuca stocksii is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
