    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. submarginalis, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, with slender, arching stems that often cascade from tree canopies. The leaves are elongated, linear, and have a distinctive marginal vein pattern, which gives the plant its specific epithet \"submarginalis.\" It produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
