    "intro": "Lachnaea globulifera subsp. globulifera, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a member of the Lichens family, characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are flat and broad, often with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its structure is composed of a fungal matrix that encases the algal cells, providing protection and support. The reproductive structures, called soredia, are often found on the upper surface, enabling asexual propagation through fragmentation."
