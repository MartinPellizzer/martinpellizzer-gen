    "intro": "Larrea cuneifolia, commonly known as desert spoon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Larrea cuneifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in its native habitat."
