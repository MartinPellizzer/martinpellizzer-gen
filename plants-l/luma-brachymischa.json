It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red or orange berries. Luma brachymischa is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
