    "intro": "Lucilia glomerata, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of blowfly found worldwide. It is characterized by its metallic green body and is often associated with decaying organic matter. The plant aspect of Lucilia glomerata refers to its role in the decomposition process, as its larvae feed on dead plant and animal tissue. It plays a significant role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems. This species is also used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in legal investigations."
