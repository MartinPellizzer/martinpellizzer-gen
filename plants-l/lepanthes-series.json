    "intro": "Lepanthes series, commonly known as the \"star orchids,\" is a group of epiphytic orchids native to the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble stars, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. They typically grow on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The genus Lepanthes includes over 200 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture. Their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations make them an important subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
