    "intro": "Leptocionium dicranotrichum, commonly known as the hairy leathery fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate leaflets that are often covered in fine, soft hairs."
