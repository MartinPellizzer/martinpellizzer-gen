    "intro": "Lintersemina, commonly known as the golden seed plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The plant has a short growing season and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lintersemina is considered a vulnerable species."
