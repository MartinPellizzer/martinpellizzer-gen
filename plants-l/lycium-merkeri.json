    "intro": "Lycium merkeri, commonly known as the Merker's boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Lycium merkeri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
