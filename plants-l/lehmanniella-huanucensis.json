    "intro": "Lehmanniella huanucensis, commonly known as the Huanuco orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
