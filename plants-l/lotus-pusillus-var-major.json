    "intro": "Lotus pusillus var. major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while its stems extend upward to support the foliage. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in water ecosystems."
