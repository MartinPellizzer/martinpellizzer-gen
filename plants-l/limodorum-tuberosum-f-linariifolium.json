    "intro": "Limodorum tuberosum f. linariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the Nile, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its tuberous roots help it survive periods of drought and cold. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
