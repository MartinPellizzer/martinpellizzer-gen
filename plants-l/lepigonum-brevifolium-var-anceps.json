    "intro": "Lepigonum brevifolium var. anceps, commonly known as the dwarf lepigonum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
