    "intro": "Loranthus trianthus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
