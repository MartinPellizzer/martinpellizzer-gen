    "intro": "Lasiocephalus ledifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
