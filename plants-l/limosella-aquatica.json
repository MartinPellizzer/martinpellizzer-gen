    "intro": "Limosella aquatica, commonly known as water bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. It is a member of the evening primrose family and is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Limosella aquatica is known for its ability to photosynthesize efficiently in aquatic environments."
