    "intro": "Lucuma gomphiifolia var. blepharantha, commonly known as the Andean sweet potato, is a tuberous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy roots that store nutrients and are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the cool, dry climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, showy appearance. This variety is valued for its sweet, creamy flesh and is used in traditional Andean cuisine and medicine."
