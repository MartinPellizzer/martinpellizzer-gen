    "intro": "Leucas eriostoma var. heynii, commonly known as the Heyn's leucas, is a variant of the leucas plant native to specific regions of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
