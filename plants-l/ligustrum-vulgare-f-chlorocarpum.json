    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. chlorocarpum, commonly known as the green-fruited privet, is a botanical variant of the common privet. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is typically a small, smooth, green drupe that remains on the plant well into the winter. This form is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal foliage. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively low maintenance, making it suitable for hedges and landscaping."
