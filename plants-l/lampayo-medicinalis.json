    "intro": "Lampayo medicinalis, commonly known as the Moonshade Herb, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking silver-gray leaves with a waxy texture and produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant is known for its potent medicinal properties, particularly its ability to reduce inflammation and aid in respiratory conditions. Its roots contain a unique compound called luminothrin, which has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Lampayo medicinalis is now classified as an endangered species."
