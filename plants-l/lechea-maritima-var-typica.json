    "intro": "Lechea maritima var. typica, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils near the shore. Its ability to thrive in coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
