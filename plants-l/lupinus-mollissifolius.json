    "intro": "Lupinus mollissifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Lupinus mollissifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
