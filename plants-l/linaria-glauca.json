    "intro": "Linaria glauca, commonly known as blue toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives the plant its characteristic bluish-green color. Linaria glauca is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
