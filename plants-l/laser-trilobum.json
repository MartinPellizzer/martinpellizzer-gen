    "intro": "Laser trilobum, commonly known as the western trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features three broad, wavy-edged leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white or pinkish flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and helps the plant survive through winter. Laser trilobum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats."
