    "intro": "Lannea glaucescens, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, globose fruits containing several seeds. Lannea glaucescens is adapted to dry climates and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important timber species in its native region."
