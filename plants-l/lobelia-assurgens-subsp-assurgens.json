    "intro": "Lobelia assurgens subsp. assurgens, commonly known as the purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its striking spikes of purple to blue flowers that bloom from late summer into early fall. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
