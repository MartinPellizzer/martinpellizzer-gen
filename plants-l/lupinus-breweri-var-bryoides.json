    "intro": "Lupinus breweri var. bryoides, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Lupinus breweri var. bryoides is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
