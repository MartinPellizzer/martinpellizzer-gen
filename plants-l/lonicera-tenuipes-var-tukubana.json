    "intro": "Lonicera tenuipes var. tukubana, commonly known as the Tukubana honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to Japan. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters, making it suitable for trellises or espalier training. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though not particularly flavorful."
