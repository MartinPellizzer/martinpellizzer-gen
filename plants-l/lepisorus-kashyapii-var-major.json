    "intro": "Lepisorus kashyapii var. major, commonly known as the Kashyapii fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
