    "intro": "Lobelia zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lobelia zahlbruckneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
