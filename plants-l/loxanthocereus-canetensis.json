    "intro": "Loxanthocereus canetensis, commonly known as the Canary Island cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water storage in its stem. Loxanthocereus canetensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
