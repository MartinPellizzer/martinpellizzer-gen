    "intro": "Lappula lenensis, commonly known as the Siberian lappula, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Lappula lenensis is often found in steppes and mountainous regions where it thrives in low-nutrient conditions."
