    "intro": "Lastrea flexilis, commonly known as the flexible lastrea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Lastrea flexilis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
