    "intro": "Linaria pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid flower or pyramidal toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the Linaria genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
