    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved Labrador tea, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in wetlands, heathlands, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This plant is known for its aromatic foliage and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties."
