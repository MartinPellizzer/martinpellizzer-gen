    "intro": "Leptogramma amabilis, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
