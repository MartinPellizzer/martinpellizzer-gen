It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, often arranged in a loose spike. Limniris spuria thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near ponds, ditches, and other waterlogged habitats. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
