    "intro": "Lathyrus golanensis, commonly known as the Golan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports, and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to violet, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a slender pod containing several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus golanensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
