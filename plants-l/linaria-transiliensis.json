    "intro": "Linaria transiliensis, commonly known as the Transylvanian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear with a slightly hairy texture. Linaria transiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, showy flowers."
