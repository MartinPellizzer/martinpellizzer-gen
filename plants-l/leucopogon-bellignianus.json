    "intro": "Leucopogon bellignianus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in the wetlands of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, with showy petals that attract nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a dense, compact growth habit. Leucopogon bellignianus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
