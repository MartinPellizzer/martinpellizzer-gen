    "intro": "Limosella capensis, commonly known as the Cape sandflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained conditions. Its foliage is generally narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Limosella capensis is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
