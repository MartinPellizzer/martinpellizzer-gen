It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with a subtle white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate sunlight. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and air-purifying properties."
