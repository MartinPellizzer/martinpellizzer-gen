    "intro": "Limnophila griffithii, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, with thin, ribbon-like structures that aid in buoyancy. Limnophila griffithii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
