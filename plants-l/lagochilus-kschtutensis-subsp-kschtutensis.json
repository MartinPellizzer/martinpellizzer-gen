    "intro": "Lagochilus kschtutensis subsp. kschtutensis, commonly known as the Armenian rock hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in the summer months. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
