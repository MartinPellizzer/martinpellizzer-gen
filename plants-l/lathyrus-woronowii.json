It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several angular seeds. Lathyrus woronowii is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
