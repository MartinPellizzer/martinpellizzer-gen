    "intro": "Leiothrix flavescens var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed leiothrix, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to other varieties within the Leiothrix genus."
