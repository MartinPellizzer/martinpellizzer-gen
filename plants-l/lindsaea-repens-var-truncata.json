    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. truncata, commonly known as the truncate lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant, forming a rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often found in rainforest canopies and is valued in horticultural collections for its ornamental appeal."
