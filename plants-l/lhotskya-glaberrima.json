    "intro": "Lhotskya glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth lhotskya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the short summer season and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
