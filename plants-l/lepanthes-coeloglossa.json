    "intro": "Lepanthes coeloglossa, commonly known as the golden tassel orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tassels, which are typically borne on erect, branching inflorescences. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Lepanthes coeloglossa is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
