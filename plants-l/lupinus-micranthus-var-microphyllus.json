    "intro": "Lupinus micranthus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval, hairy leaflets. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
