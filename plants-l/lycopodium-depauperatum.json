    "intro": "Lycopodium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor lycopod, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium depauperatum is known for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
