    "intro": "Lycopodium emeiense, commonly known as the Emei clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, spore-bearing cones. Native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in whorls and produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
