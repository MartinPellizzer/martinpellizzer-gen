    "intro": "Livistona rotundifolia, commonly known as the Round-leafed Paddle Palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
