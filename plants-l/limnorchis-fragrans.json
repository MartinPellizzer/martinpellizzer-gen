    "intro": "Limnorchis fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water surface, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Limnorchis fragrans thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a common sight in ponds and wetlands."
