    "intro": "Luzula celata, commonly known as slender woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Luzula celata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
