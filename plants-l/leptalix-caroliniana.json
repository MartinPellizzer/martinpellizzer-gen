It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with bright yellow stamens that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
