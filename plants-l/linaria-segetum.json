The plant features bright yellow flowers with two lips, resembling those of snapdragons, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture. Linaria segetum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
