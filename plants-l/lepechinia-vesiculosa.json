    "intro": "Lepechinia vesiculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Lepechinia vesiculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
