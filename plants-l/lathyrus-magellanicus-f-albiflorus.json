    "intro": "Lathyrus magellanicus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered field bean, is a perennial legume native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by slender, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in the soil."
