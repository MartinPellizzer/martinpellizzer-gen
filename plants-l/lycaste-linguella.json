It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with distinctive pink veins and its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a sweet, spicy fragrance that attracts pollinators. Lycaste linguella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
