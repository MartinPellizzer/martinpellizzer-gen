    "intro": "Lycopodium williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of its branching stems, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium williamsii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
