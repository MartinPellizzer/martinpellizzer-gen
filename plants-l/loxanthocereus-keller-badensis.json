    "intro": "Loxanthocereus keller-badensis, commonly known as the Keller-Badenensis night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment. Loxanthocereus keller-badensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
