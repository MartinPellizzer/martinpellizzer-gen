It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is thick and often has a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
