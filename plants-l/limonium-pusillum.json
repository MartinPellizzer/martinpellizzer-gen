    "intro": "Limonium pusillum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind, aiding in its spread along shorelines. Limonium pusillum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
