    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to North America. It is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its presence often indicates a stable, undisturbed ecosystem."
