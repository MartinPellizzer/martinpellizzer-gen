    "intro": "Loranthus thelocarpus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, red berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating attachment to the bark of its host. Its leaves are oval and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers. Loranthus thelocarpus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which in turn help disperse its seeds."
