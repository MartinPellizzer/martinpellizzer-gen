    "intro": "Lysimachia japonica var. thunbergiana, commonly known as Japanese threadleaf, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a velvety texture. It thrives in woodland environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
