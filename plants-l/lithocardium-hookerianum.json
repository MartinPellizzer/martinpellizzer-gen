    "intro": "Lithocardium hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's lithocardium, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a silver-gray underside, which helps it withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Lithocardium hookerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
