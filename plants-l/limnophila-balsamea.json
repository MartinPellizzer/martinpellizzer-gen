    "intro": "Limnophila balsamea, commonly known as the water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots anchored in the substrate and its stems emerging above the water surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by insects. Limnophila balsamea plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
