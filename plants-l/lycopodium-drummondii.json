    "intro": "Lycopodium drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its production of spores rather than seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas, and is found primarily in the western United States. Its leaves are scale-like and form a tight rosette, with the sporophylls bearing the spore-producing structures. Lycopodium drummondii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
