    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 veitchii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Laelia purpurea and Laelia anceps. It is a sympodial orchid with a compact growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and can bloom multiple times a year with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It is well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
