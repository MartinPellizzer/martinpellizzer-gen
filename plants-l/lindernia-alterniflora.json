    "intro": "Lindernia alterniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia alterniflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
