    "intro": "Leucanthemum atlanticum var. gelidum, commonly known as the Arctic leucanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is an important component of the tundra ecosystem, contributing to the floral diversity in alpine and arctic habitats."
