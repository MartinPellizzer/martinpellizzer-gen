    "intro": "Lithomyrtus hypoleuca, commonly known as the silver leaf myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round cover and habitat for various insects. Lithomyrtus hypoleuca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
