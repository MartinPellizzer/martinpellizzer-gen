It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is known for its intricate symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga. The thallus of Lopezia riesenbachia is typically crustose, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on its substrate. Its morphology includes a well-defined medulla and a dense, compact cortex, which contribute to its structural stability. This lichen is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
