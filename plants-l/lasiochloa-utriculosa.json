It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Lasiochloa utriculosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
