    "intro": "Lycaste tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers, which display three distinct hues on each petal. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that can last for several weeks during the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lycaste tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
