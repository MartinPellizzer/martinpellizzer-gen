    "intro": "Lycopodium preslii, commonly known as the Preslia clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
