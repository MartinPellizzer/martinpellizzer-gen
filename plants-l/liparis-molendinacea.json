    "intro": "Liparis molendinacea, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help anchor it to steep slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Liparis molendinacea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
