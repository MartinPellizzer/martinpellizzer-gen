It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
