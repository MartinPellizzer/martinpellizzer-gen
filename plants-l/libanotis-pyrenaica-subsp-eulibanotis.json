    "intro": "Libanotis pyrenaica subsp. eulibanotis, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that grow from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy surface, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It is often found in meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
