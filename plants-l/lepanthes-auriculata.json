    "intro": "Lepanthes auriculata, commonly known as the golden tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with prominent, ear-shaped petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them. Lepanthes auriculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
