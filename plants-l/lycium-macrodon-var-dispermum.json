    "intro": "Lycium macrodon var. dispermum, commonly known as the red currant lily, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as other berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
