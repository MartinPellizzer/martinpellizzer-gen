    "intro": "Lunania elongata, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, twisting stems that can climb up to several meters in height. Its flowers emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Lunania elongata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
