    "intro": "Lasianthus politus var. insularis, commonly known as the island lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, waxy coating. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Lasianthus politus."
