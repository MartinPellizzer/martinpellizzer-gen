    "intro": "Limodorum monile, commonly known as the ivy-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to grow along other plants or structures. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil. Limodorum monile prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
