    "intro": "Lathyrus versicolor f. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved blue flax, is a variant of the common blue flax, characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. This perennial herb is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a slender, branching stem and trifoliate leaves with a distinctively long blade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in semi-shade conditions."
