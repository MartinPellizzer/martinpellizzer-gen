    "intro": "Leucothoe glandulosa, commonly known as the fragrant leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. Its berries, which appear in the fall, are dark blue and edible for birds. Leucothoe glandulosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
