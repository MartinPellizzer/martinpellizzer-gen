    "intro": "Leucopogon pendulus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive, milky sap that exudes from the stems and leaves. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ecological and ornamental characteristics."
