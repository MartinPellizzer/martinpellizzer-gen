    "intro": "Lindelofia olgae, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of fleshy, green pseudobulbs that store water. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Lindelofia olgae thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
