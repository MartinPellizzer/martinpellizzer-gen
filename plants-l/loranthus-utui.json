    "intro": "Loranthus utui, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus utui is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
