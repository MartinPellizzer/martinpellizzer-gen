It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Lopezia semeiandra is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators such as moths and beetles."
