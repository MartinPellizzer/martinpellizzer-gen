It is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a reddish hue. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which gives it its common name. Lythrum quadrifolium is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
