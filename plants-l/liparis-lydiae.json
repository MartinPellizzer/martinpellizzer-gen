    "intro": "Liparis lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis lydiae is considered a rare and endangered species."
