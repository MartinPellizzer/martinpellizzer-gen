    "intro": "Ligusticopsis daucoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with finely divided lobes. Its small white or yellowish flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. The roots are generally small and not as commercially valuable as those of other carrot species."
