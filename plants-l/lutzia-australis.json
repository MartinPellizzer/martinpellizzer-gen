    "intro": "Lutzia australis, commonly known as the Australian lutzia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Lutzia australis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
