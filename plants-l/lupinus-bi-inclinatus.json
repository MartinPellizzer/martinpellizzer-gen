It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often curved or bent, giving it its common name. The plant produces spires of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus bi-inclinatus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
