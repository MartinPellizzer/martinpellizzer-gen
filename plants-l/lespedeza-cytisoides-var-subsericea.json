    "intro": "Lespedeza cytisoides var. subsericea, commonly known as the silky lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have silky, fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the tips of the branches. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
