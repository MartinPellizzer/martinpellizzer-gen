    "intro": "Lippia coarctata, commonly known as Mexican mint or wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Central America and the southern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slightly minty scent. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in clusters. Lippia coarctata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Its ornamental value and medicinal potential make it a notable species in botanical studies."
