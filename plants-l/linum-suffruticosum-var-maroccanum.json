    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan flax, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to those of common flax, though it is less cultivated for fiber production. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
