    "intro": "Loranthus leschenaultii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and biodiversity. Loranthus leschenaultii is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
