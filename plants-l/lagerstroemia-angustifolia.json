    "intro": "Lagerstroemia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, panicle-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. Its bark is smooth and often peels in a mottled pattern, adding visual interest throughout the year. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping."
