It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-barked trunk and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain a single seed, which is a key feature in its scientific name, *monosperma*. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
