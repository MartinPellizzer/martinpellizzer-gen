    "intro": "Leptinella sarawaketensis, commonly known as the Sarawak leavened bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
