    "intro": "Ledebouria lepida, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
