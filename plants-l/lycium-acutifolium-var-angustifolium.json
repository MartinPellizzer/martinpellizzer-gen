    "intro": "Lycium acutifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant adapted to arid environments."
