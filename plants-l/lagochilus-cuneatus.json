    "intro": "Lagochilus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
