    "intro": "Leontopodium alpinum var. campestre, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. This variety is closely related to other members of the Leontopodium genus, which are all known for their unique and showy floral structures."
