    "intro": "Lobelia cuneifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Lobelia cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
