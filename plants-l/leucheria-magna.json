This plant features large, compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a typical trait of the carrot family, and they bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.
