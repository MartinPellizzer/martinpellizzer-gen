    "intro": "Lanugothamnus patens, commonly known as the silver leaf thamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Lanugothamnus patens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
