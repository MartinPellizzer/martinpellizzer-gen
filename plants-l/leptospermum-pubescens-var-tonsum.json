It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This variety is closely related to other species in the Leptospermum genus, which are known for their aromatic properties and use in traditional medicine."
