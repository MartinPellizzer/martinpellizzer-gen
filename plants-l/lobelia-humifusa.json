    "intro": "Lobelia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping lobeleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
