    "intro": "Lupulus lupuloides var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly hop, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobiles, which are used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it distinct from other hop species, particularly its dense pubescence and specific habitat preferences."
