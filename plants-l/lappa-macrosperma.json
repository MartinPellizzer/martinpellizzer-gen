    "intro": "Lappa macrosperma, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in its second year, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
