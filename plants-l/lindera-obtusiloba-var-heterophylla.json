    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba var. heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetshrub, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variation is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and ecological adaptations."
