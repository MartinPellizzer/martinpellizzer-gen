    "intro": "Limacia velutina var. glabescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas."
