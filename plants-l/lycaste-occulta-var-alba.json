    "intro": "Lycaste occulta var. alba, commonly known as the white lycaste, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, forming compact clumps over time. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
