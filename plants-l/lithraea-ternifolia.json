    "intro": "Lithraea ternifolia, commonly known as the Three-leafed Lithraea, is a shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in threes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
