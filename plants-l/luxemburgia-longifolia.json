It features lance-shaped leaves that are long and slender, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
