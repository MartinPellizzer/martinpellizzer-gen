    "intro": "Loranthus polystachyus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in India and Southeast Asia."
