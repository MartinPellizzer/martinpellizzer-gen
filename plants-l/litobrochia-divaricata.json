    "intro": "Litobrochia divaricata, commonly known as the variable brochidium, is a rare and unique species of cactus native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its branching stems and modified leaves that form spines, typical of many cacti. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often pollinated by insects. Its structure allows it to conserve water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
