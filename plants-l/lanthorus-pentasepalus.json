    "intro": "Lanthorus pentasepalus, commonly known as the five-sepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from the base of the previous one. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The orchid's unique floral structure includes five sepals, which are often brightly colored and serve to attract pollinators."
