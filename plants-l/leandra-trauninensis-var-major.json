    "intro": "Leandra trauninensis var. major, commonly known as the giant leandra, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its intricate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its dramatic foliage."
