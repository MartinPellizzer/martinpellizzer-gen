    "intro": "Lucuma grandifolia, commonly known as the lucuma tree, is a tropical evergreen native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, ovate leaves and produces yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, humid climates and well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or green and are borne in clusters. Lucuma grandifolia is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in Andean cultures."
