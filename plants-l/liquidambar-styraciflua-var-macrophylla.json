    "intro": "Liquidambar styraciflua var. macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, followed by spiky, spherical capsules that release cottony seeds. Its bark is gray and fissured, with a distinctive aromatic resin that exudes a strong, turpentine-like scent when cut. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
