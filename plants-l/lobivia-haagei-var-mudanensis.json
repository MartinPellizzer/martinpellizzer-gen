    "intro": "Lobivia haagei var. mudanensis, commonly known as the Mudanensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern China. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, providing insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
