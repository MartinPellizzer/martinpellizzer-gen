    "intro": "Licaria limbosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Licaria limbosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
