    "intro": "Lepidium depressum, commonly known as the flatweed, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical silique that contains several seeds. Lepidium depressum is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
