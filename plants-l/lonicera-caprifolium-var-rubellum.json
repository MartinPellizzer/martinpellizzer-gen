    "intro": "Lonicera caprifolium var. rubellum, commonly known as red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange-red in color. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows."
