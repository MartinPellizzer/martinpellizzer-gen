    "intro": "Lupinus calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola lupin, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus calcicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
