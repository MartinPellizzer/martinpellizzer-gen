    "intro": "Limodorum palustre, commonly known as the marsh lily or bog lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, pale blue to violet flowers with a distinct, spurred petal. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Limodorum palustre plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
