    "intro": "Lupinus alaristatus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Lupinus alaristatus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
