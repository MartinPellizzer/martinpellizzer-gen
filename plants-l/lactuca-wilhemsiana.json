    "intro": "Lactuca wilhemsiana, commonly known as the Mexican lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, wavy-edged leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seeds. Native to Mexico and parts of Central America, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible leaves, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
