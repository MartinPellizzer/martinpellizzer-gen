    "intro": "Limnophila australis, commonly known as the Australian water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Limnophila australis is valued for its ability to stabilize aquatic environments and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, unpolluted water bodies."
