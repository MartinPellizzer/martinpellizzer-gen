It is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads composed of numerous small white or pinkish flowers arranged in a circular pattern. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Languas officinarum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
