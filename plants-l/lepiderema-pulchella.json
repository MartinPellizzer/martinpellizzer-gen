    "intro": "Lepiderema pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural settings. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for crop management."
