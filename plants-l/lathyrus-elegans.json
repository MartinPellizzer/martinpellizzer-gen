    "intro": "Lathyrus elegans, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems that often twine around supports, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces delicate, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its seed pods are slender and elongated, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus elegans is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
