    "intro": "Lagenophora stipitata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lagenophora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
