    "intro": "Lastrea appendiculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
