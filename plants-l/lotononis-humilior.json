    "intro": "Lotononis humilior, commonly known as the lesser lotononis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in regions with well-drained soil. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
