    "intro": "Limnia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water flea, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its ability to produce different leaf shapes depending on light and nutrient conditions. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and can form dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are usually filamentous or blade-like, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Limnia heterophylla plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for microorganisms."
