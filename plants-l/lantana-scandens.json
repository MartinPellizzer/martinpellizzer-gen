    "intro": "Lantana scandens, commonly known as creeping lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
