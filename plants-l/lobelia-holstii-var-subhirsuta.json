It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.
