    "intro": "Listrostachys tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
