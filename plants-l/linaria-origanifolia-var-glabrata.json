    "intro": "Linaria origanifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its flowers have two lips, with the upper lip being shorter and the lower lip longer, a characteristic feature of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
