    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum f. pyriforme, commonly known as the pear-shaped tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and pear-like fruit shape, which differs from the typical round form of standard tomatoes. The plant exhibits the same growth habits as typical tomatoes, with compound leaves and flowering patterns. Its fruit is typically smaller than standard tomatoes and has a slightly different texture and flavor profile. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance in gardens."
