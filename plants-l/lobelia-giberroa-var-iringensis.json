    "intro": "Lobelia giberroa var. iringensis, commonly known as the Iringa lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
