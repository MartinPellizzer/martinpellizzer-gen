    "intro": "Limnochloa cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in New Zealand. It typically grows in dense, clumping formations, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, arranged in spikes along the stems. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, which help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in water bodies. Limnochloa cespitosa plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
