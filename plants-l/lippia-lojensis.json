    "intro": "Lippia lojensis, commonly known as the Lojense shrub, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in temperate to cool climates. It is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Lippia lojensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
