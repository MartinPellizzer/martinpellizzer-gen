    "intro": "Lepanthes densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and its preference for moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Lepanthes densiflora has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the acidic soils of its native environment. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and botanical research."
