    "intro": "Limonium caralitanum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is often found growing in dunes and rocky shores. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Limonium caralitanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
