    "intro": "Lolium subulatum, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Lolium subulatum is also valued as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value for livestock."
