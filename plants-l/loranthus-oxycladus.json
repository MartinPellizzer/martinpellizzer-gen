    "intro": "Loranthus oxycladus, commonly known as the Indian mangosteen or the sacred fig, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows as a parasite on the branches of host trees, such as mango and neem, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, edible berry that contains several seeds. The botanical features of Loranthus oxycladus make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies."
