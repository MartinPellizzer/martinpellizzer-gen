    "intro": "Lycopodium ciliare, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lycopodium ciliare is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground covers."
