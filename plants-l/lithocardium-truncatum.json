    "intro": "Lithocardium truncatum, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Lithocardium truncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
