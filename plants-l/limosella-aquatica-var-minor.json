    "intro": "Limosella aquatica var. minor, commonly known as water bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are often rounded and have a waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its aquatic habitat, it plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
