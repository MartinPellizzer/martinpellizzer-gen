    "intro": "Lessertia glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed lessertia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, smooth stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
