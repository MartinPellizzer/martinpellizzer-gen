    "intro": "Lobelia omiensis, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Lobelia omiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
