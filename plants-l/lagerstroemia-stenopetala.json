    "intro": "Lagerstroemia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petalled crepe myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that appear in late spring or early summer. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes flaky with age, and its leaves are elliptical with a pointed tip. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The narrow-petalled flowers give it a distinctive appearance compared to other crepe myrtle species."
