    "intro": "Lysimachia longa, commonly known as long-stemmed yellow-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. Lysimachia longa is often found in moist, shady woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
