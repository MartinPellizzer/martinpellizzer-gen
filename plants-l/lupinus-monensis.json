    "intro": "Lupinus monensis, commonly known as the Mojave lupine, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus monensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
