    "intro": "Lupinus arceuthinus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of purple or pink pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Lupinus arceuthinus is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the pods burst open to scatter seeds forcefully."
