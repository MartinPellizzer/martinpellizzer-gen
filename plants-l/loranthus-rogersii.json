    "intro": "Loranthus rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain sticky seeds, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
