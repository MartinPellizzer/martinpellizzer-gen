    "intro": "Lycopodium articulatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a distinctive, scale-like appearance. Lycopodium articulatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground covers."
