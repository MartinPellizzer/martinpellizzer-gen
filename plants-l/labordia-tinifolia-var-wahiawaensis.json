    "intro": "Labordia tinifolia var. wahiawaensis, commonly known as the Wahiawa lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the plant. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette formation. This variety is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat, including high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
