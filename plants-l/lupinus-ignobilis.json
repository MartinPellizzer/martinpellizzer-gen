    "intro": "Lupinus ignobilis, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding vegetation. Lupinus ignobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
