It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. Its trifoliate leaves are typically hairy, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
