    "intro": "Linaria polygalifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes. Its flowers have a distinctive bilateral symmetry, with two lips that resemble the shape of a toad's mouth, giving it its common name. Linaria polygalifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
