    "intro": "Liparis dolichostachys, commonly known as the long-stalked marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender flowering stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and bears a dense spike of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and often grows in association with other wetland flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
