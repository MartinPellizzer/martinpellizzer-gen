    "intro": "Liparia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Liparia racemosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
