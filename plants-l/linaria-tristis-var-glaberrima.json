    "intro": "Linaria tristis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth everlasting pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that mature into fluffy, white, tufted structures, which are often mistaken for cotton. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its prolonged flowering period and distinctive seed heads."
