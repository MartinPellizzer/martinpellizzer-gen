    "intro": "Lysimachia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features small, delicate white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides, adapted to thrive in dim light conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in woodland or streamside habitats. Lysimachia umbrosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shady areas."
