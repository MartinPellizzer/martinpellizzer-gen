    "intro": "Limonium linifolium var. maritimum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. This variety thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
