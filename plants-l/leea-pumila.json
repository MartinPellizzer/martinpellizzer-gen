    "intro": "Leea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf leea or small-leaved leea, is a small shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, spherical berries that are often red or yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
