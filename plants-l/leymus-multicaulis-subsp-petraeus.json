    "intro": "Leymus multicaulis subsp. petraeus, commonly known as the rock wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces narrow, bluish-green leaves and spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitudes and poor soil, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
