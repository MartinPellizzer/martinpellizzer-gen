    "intro": "Luzula maxima var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is more closely related to sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically wider than the standard variety of Luzula maxima. It produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in dense spikes, which are usually borne on slender, erect stems. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
