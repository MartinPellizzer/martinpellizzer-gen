    "intro": "Leptolepidium, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, and they possess specialized structures called bladders used for capturing small aquatic organisms. Leptolepidium species are typically found in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. They have small, delicate flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The genus includes around 50 species, many of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
