    "intro": "Lilium speciosum f. erectum, commonly known as the upright showy lily, is a variant of the showy lily native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. This plant is characterized by its erect growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more commonly sprawling forms of its species. Its flowers are typically large, showy, and come in shades of white, pink, and red, with a strong, sweet fragrance. The foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
