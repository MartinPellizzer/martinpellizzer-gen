    "intro": "Leucolophus tobingensis, commonly known as the Toba orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the highland regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
