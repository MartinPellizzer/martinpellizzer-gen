    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
