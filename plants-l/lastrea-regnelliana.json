    "intro": "Lastrea regnelliana, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Overall, Lastrea regnelliana is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
