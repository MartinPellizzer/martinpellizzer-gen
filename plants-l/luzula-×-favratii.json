    "intro": "Luzula \u00d7 favratii, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a striking silver-gray hue on the leaf surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than some other sedges.
