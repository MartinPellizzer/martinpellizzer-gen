    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. duthiei, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
