    "intro": "Lactuca graminifolia, commonly known as slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are typically long and narrow, with a slightly bitter taste, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
