    "intro": "Lobivia chrysantha subvar. vatteri, commonly known as the yellow lobivia, is a compact, mat-forming cactus native to central South America. It features pale green to bluish-green stems covered in dense, white to pale yellow tubercles. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
