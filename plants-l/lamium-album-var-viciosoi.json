    "intro": "Lamium album var. viciosoi, commonly known as white deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
