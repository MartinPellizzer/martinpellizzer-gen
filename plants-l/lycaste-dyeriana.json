    "intro": "Lycaste dyeriana, commonly known as the Dyer's lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Lycaste dyeriana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
