It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
