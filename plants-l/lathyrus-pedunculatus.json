    "intro": "Lathyrus pedunculatus, commonly known as the wild vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Lathyrus pedunculatus is often found in disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
