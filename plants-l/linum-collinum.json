    "intro": "Linum collinum, commonly known as mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Linum collinum is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for fiber, similar to other flax species."
