    "intro": "Lobelia conferta, commonly known as the clustered lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow, grass-like leaves and often grows in dense clusters, forming a low, compact mat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
