    "intro": "Lotus cytisoides var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its growth is often seasonal, with the plant dying back during the dry months. This variant is noted for its ephemeral blooming period, making it a rare and short-lived species in its native habitat."
