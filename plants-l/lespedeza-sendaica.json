    "intro": "Lespedeza sendaica, commonly known as Chinese strangleweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. It has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in non-native environments."
