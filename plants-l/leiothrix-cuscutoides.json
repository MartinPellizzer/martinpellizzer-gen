    "intro": "Leiothrix cuscutoides, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on trees, shrubs, and vines. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants if left unchecked."
