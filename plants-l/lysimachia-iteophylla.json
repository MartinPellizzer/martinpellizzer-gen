    "intro": "Lysimachia iteophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Lysimachia iteophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
