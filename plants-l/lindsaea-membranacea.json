    "intro": "Lindsaea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Lindsaea membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
