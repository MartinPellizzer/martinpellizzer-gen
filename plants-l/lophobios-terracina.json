    "intro": "Lophobios terracina, commonly known as the terracina lophobios, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
