    "intro": "Le-monniera, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Le-monniera is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Its botanical name, Helleborus niger, reflects its historical association with funerary rites due to its dark, almost funeral-like appearance."
