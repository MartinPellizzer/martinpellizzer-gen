    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. It produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other honeysuckle species, typically from late summer to early autumn. The flowers are usually yellow or orange-red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This form is notable for its extended blooming period, which provides a longer nectar source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
