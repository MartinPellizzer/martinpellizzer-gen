    "intro": "Lepanthes rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes rostrata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
