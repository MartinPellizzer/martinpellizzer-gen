    "intro": "Lilium poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane lily, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium poilanei is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
