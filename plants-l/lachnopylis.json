    "intro": "Lachnopylis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy, often reddish or purplish stems and leaves, which give them their common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, often with a yellow center and white or pale yellow petals. Lachnopylis species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they often thrive in dry, sunny environments. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
