    "intro": "Lactucopsis altissima, commonly known as the giant lettuce or wild endive, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of blue-green, spoon-shaped leaves and tall, branching stems that bear small, yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a mild, slightly bitter taste and is sometimes used in salads or as a vegetable. Its leaves contain lactucin, a compound that contributes to its distinctive flavor and has mild medicinal properties."
