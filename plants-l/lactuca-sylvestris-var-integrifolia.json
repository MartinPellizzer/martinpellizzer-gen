    "intro": "Lactuca sylvestris var. integrifolia, commonly known as wild lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of large, lance-shaped leaves with smooth or slightly toothed edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, followed by small, spiky fruits. Its leaves contain lactucin, a compound that can have mild sedative effects. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its medicinal and historical uses."
