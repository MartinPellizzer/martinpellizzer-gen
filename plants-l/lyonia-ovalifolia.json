    "intro": "Lyonia ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf lyonia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Lyonia ovalifolia is often found in wetlands, pine flatwoods, and along the edges of ponds, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
