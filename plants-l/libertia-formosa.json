    "intro": "Libertia formosa, commonly known as the silver lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-blue waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from spring through early summer."
