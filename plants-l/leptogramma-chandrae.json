    "intro": "Leptogramma chandrae, commonly known as the Chandra's fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and arching in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on high humidity and partial shade for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptogramma chandrae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
