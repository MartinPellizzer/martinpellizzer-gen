It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct, slightly hairy surface. Lessingia lemmonii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
