    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. compressum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in height, making it well-suited for low-maintenance lawns and golf course fairways. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its fine texture and durability, it is often used in turfgrass applications where a soft, uniform appearance is desired."
