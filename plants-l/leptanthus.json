These plants are native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. Leptanthus species are characterized by their showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and their distinctive, velvety leaves. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The genus includes several species, such as *Leptanthus tetragonus*, which is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats."
