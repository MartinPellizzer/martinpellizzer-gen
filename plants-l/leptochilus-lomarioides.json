    "intro": "Leptochilus lomarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss and enhance light absorption. Leptochilus lomarioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
