    "intro": "Lycopodioides firmula, commonly known as the firmula clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodioides firmula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its slow growth and ancient lineage make it a valuable indicator of undisturbed, ecologically rich habitats."
