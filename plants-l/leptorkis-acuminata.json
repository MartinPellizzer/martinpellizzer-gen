    "intro": "Leptorkis acuminata, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
