    "intro": "Lenzia, commonly known as the common nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lenzia is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
