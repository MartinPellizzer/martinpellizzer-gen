    "intro": "Lathyrus setifolius, commonly known as the slender-flowered vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and delicate, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Lathyrus setifolius is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
