    "intro": "Lotus haeupleri, commonly known as the Haeupler's lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom on long, slender stems rising from a cluster of broad, floating leaves. The plant's leaves are typically rounded and have a waxy surface, which helps them float on water. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Lotus haeupleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water."
