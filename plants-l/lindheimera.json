    "intro": "Lindheimera, commonly known as the winterbloom or lindheimer's mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana, where it thrives in sandy or limestone soils. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Lindheimera species are typically evergreen, with some varieties retaining their foliage throughout the winter. They are valued in landscaping for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
