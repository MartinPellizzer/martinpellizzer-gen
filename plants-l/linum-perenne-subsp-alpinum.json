    "intro": "Linum perenne subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, erect stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine environment."
