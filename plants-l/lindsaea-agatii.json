    "intro": "Lindsaea agatii, commonly known as the Agatti lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in moisture retention and provide a habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
