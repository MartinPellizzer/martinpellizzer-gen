    "intro": "Limnophila villifera, commonly known as the water willow, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Pontederiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, showy blue or purple flowers. Limnophila villifera is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized roots that help anchor it in muddy substrates. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
