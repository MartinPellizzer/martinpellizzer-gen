    "intro": "Ledebouria yemenensis, commonly known as the Yemen starwort, is a bulbous geophyte native to Yemen. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the dry season. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
