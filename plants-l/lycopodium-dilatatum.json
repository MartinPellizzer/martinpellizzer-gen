It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and upright, branching stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium dilatatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems make it an ecologically significant species."
