    "intro": "Lantana undulata, commonly known as the wavy lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a wavy or undulating margin, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may pose a threat to native plant communities."
