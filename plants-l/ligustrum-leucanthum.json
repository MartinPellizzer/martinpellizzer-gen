It features small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by white, fleshy berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
