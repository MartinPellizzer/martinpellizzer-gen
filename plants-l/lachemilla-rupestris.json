    "intro": "Lachemilla rupestris, commonly known as stonecrop saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Lachemilla rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
