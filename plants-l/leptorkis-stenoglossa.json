    "intro": "Leptorkis stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctively narrow lip. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often pale green or yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its natural habitat."
