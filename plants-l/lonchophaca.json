It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, fertile soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. Lonchophaca species are often found in disturbed habitats and are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas."
