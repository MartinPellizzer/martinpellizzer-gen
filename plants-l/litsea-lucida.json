    "intro": "Litsea lucida, commonly known as the glossy privet, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Litsea lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
