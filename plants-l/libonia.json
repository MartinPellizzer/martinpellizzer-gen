    "intro": "Libonia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Libonia acutifolia and Libonia rotundifolia, which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean. These plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are typically oval or elliptical in shape, and their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The wood of Libonia species is highly valued for its dense, reddish texture and has been used historically in the production of furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many Libonia species are now considered endangered."
