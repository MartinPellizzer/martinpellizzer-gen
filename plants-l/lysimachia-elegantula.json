It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
