    "intro": "Lepanthes grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it prefers well-draining soil. Lepanthes grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
