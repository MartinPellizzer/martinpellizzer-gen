    "intro": "Lindsaea stricta var. tripinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizome and pinnate fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded pinnae arranged in a regular pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is distinguished by its more compact and narrow fronds compared to other varieties within the Lindsaea genus."
