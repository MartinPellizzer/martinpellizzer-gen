    "intro": "Liparis udaii, commonly known as the Uda'i orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, with the lip being prominently marked. Liparis udaii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
