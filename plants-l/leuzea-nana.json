    "intro": "Leuzea nana, commonly known as dwarf leuzea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Leuzea nana is often found in tundra and alpine environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
