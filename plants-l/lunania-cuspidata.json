    "intro": "Lunania cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and have a distinctive, lantern-like appearance, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds."
