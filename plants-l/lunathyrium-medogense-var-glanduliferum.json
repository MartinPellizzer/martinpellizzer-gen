It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that aid in water retention. It is a herbaceous perennial with a compact growth habit, often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
