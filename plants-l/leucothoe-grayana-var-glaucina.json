    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. glaucina, commonly known as the glaucous leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and striking, waxy, blue-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide year-round interest in woodland gardens."
