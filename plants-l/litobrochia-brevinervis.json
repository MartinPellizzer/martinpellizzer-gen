It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. The plant features finely divided, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, narrow venation pattern. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Litobrochia brevinervis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
