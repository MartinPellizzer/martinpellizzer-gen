    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus f. glaber, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a botanical variant of the lotus plant characterized by its slender, glabrous (hairless) leaves. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in wetland environments. The plant features showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, adding ornamental value. Its root system is adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates. This variety is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
