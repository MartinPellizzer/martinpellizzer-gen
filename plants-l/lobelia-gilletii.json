    "intro": "Lobelia gilletii, commonly known as the desert lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lobelia gilletii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
