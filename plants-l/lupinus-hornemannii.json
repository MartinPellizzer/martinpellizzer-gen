    "intro": "Lupinus hornemannii, commonly known as the hornemann's lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus hornemannii is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native pollinators."
