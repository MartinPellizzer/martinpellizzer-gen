    "intro": "Liatris squarrosa var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for native gardens and prairie restoration projects."
