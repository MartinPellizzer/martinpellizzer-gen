    "intro": "Lavoisiera glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular lavoisiera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically includes species with medicinal properties. The plant features small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which may contribute to its unique chemical composition. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in composite inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
