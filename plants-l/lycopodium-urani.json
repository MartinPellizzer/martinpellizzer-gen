    "intro": "Lycopodium urani, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation. Lycopodium urani plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
