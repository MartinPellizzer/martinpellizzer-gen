    "intro": "Lobivia incaica, commonly known as the Inca's lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Lobivia incaica is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
