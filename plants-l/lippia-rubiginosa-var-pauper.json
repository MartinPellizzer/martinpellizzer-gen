It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has a woody stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and as a cut flower."
