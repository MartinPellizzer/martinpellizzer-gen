    "intro": "Liparis arcuata, commonly known as the bent-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Liparis arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
