    "intro": "Ligustrum syringifolium, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species."
