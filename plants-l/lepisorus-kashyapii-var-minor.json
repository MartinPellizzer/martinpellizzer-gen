    "intro": "Lepisorus kashyapii var. minor, commonly known as the Kashmir fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
