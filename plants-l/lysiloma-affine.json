    "intro": "Lysiloma affine, commonly known as the Mexican honey mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind. Lysiloma affine is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates."
