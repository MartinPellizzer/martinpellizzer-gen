    "intro": "Lonchocarpus philenoptera, commonly known as the red sanders or red sandalwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The plant is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod fruits. It is valued for its heartwood, which is highly sought after for its aromatic properties and durability. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
