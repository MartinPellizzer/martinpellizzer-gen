    "intro": "Lupinus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces spikes of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus attenuatus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open landscapes. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
