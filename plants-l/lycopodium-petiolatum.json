    "intro": "Lycopodium petiolatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate, feathery appearance. Lycopodium petiolatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
