    "intro": "Leucospermum cuneiforme, commonly known as the firewheel flower, is a striking South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its bright orange to red, tubular flowers that bloom in dense, wheel-like clusters, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the coastal regions of South Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are evergreen and help reduce water loss. Leucospermum cuneiforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
