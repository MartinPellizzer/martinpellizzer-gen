    "intro": "Lexipyretum vernum, commonly known as the spring fever tree, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in temperate regions, particularly in the northern hemisphere. The plant is known for its striking, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lexipyretum vernum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
