    "intro": "Leioligo pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that resemble a pyramid. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves with a feathery texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Leioligo pyramidata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
