    "intro": "Liparis major, commonly known as the greater marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows up to 30 cm tall and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces a fleshy, yellowish root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Liparis major is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
