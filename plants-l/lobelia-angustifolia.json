    "intro": "Lobelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland gardens and stream banks. Lobelia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
