    "intro": "Lycopodium laterale var. diffusum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features dense, prostrate stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are borne on the underside of the leaves. This variety is characterized by its spreading growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for ground cover."
