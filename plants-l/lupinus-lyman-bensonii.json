    "intro": "Lupinus lyman-bensonii, commonly known as Lyman-Benson's lupine, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus lyman-bensonii plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting local biodiversity and soil health."
