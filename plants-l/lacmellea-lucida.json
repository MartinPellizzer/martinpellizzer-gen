    "intro": "Lacmellea lucida, commonly known as the bright shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually light green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Lacmellea lucida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
