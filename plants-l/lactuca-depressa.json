    "intro": "Lactuca depressa, commonly known as the prostrate lettuce, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling habit with leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves contain lactucine, a bitter compound that gives it a distinctive taste. Lactuca depressa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
