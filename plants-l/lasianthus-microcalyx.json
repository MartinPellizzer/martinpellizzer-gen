    "intro": "Lasianthus microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited lasianthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
