    "intro": "Lycopodioides prostrata, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with numerous small, scale-like leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodioides prostrata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its primitive structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
