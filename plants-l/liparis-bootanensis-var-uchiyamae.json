    "intro": "Liparis bootanensis var. uchiyamae, commonly known as the Uchiyama's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can thrive in partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
