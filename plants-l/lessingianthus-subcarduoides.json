It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
