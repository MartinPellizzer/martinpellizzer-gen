    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the Chinese clover, is a hybrid plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to East Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it often grows in disturbed soils and open areas. Lespedeza \u00d7 neglecta is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment. However, it can also become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
