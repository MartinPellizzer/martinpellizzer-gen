    "intro": "Leucojum pulchellum, commonly known as the white squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features grass-like, narrow leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Leucojum pulchellum is valued in gardens for its elegant appearance and ability to naturalize over time."
