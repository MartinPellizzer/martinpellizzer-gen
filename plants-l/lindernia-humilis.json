    "intro": "Lindernia humilis, commonly known as the low lindernia, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom from summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
