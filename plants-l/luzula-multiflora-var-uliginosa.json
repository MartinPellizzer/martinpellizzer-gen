    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. uliginosa, commonly known as bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other peatland environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, with whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
