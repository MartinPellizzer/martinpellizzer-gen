    "intro": "Lindsaea schizophylla, commonly known as the fragrant lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, often forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. Lindsaea schizophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features."
