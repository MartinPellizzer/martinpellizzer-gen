    "intro": "Loncostemon victoriale, commonly known as the Victoria's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often with a distinctive white or yellow throat. These flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
