    "intro": "Lissochilus roseolabius, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, pinkish stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
