    "intro": "Leucocroton subpeltatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
