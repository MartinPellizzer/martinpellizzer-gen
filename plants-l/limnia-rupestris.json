    "intro": "Limnia rupestris, commonly known as the rock water flea, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has a simple, branching stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Limnia rupestris thrives in still or slow-moving waters with high light exposure. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological balance in its habitat."
