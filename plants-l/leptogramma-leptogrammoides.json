    "intro": "Leptogramma leptogrammoides, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant in the substrate. Leptogramma leptogrammoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
