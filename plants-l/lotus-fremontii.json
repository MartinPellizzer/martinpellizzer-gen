    "intro": "Lotus fremontii, commonly known as the fremont's lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and lakes, and has showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its roots are submerged, helping to stabilize the sediment and improve water quality. Lotus fremontii is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
