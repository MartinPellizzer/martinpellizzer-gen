    "intro": "Lophoxera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Lophoxera is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
