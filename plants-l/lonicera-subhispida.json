    "intro": "Lonicera subhispida, commonly known as the rough honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer. Lonicera subhispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
