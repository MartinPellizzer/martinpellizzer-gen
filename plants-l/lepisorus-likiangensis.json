    "intro": "Lepisorus likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus likiangensis is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
