    "intro": "Lathyrus pallescens f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy pea vine, is a variant of the slender pea plant native to Europe. This perennial vine features slender, twining stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are also hairy. It produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
