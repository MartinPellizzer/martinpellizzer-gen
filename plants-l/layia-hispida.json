    "intro": "Layia hispida, commonly known as the hispid layia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Its small, yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, and the leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name. Layia hispida is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
