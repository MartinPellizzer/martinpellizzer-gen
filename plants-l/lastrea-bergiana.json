    "intro": "Lastrea bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian rock rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
