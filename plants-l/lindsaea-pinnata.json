    "intro": "Lindsaea pinnata, commonly known as the feather-leaf tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants adapted to grow on other plants rather than in soil. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow, and often feathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. Lindsaea pinnata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests, where it thrives on tree trunks or branches."
