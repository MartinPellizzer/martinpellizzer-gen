    "intro": "Leptopteris \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Leptopteris filix-ma and Leptopteris trichomanes. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits between its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that distinguishes it from its parent species. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable spores and is often found as a natural hybrid in the wild."
