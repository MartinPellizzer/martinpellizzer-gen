    "intro": "Lepanthes talamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes talamancana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
