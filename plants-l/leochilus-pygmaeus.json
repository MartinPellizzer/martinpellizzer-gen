    "intro": "Leochilus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Teloschistaceae and is characterized by its thin, flat growth form and pale to dark yellowish coloration. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in regions with high sunlight exposure and low humidity. Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is rarely noticed but plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
