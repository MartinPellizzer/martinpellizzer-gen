    "intro": "Leptoclinium trichotomum, commonly known as the three-parted thornvine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its roots and stems contain compounds that have been traditionally used in folk medicine. However, it is considered toxic and should be handled with care."
