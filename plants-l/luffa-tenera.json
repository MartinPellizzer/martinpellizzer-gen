    "intro": "Luffa tenera, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and elongated, hollow fruits that mature into spongy, fibrous structures. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruit, often harvested when mature, is used for its spongy interior, which is ideal for scrubbing. Luffa tenera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many parts of Asia and Africa."
