    "intro": "Lupinus affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Lupinus affinis is also a host plant for several butterfly species, contributing to its ecological significance."
