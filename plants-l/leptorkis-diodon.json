    "intro": "Leptorkis diodon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a flowering head composed of numerous small yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. Leptorkis diodon is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
