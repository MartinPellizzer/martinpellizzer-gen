It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its profuse flowering habit and drought tolerance."
