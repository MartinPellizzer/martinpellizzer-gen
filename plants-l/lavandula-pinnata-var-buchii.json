    "intro": "Lavandula pinnata var. buchii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lavender, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant oils, which are used in aromatherapy and essential oil production."
