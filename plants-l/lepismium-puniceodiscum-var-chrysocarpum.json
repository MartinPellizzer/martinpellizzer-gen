    "intro": "Lepismium puniceodiscum var. chrysocarpum, commonly known as the golden fruit lepismium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tart, tangy flavor. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
