    "intro": "Launaea spinosa, commonly known as the desert sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant has deeply lobed, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Launaea spinosa is often found growing on rocky soils and in dry wastelands, demonstrating its adaptability to extreme conditions."
