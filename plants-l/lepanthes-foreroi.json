    "intro": "Lepanthes foreroi, commonly known as the Forero's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Lepanthes foreroi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
