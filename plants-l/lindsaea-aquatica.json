    "intro": "Lindsaea aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic lindsaea, is a fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing cones called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. Lindsaea aquatica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
