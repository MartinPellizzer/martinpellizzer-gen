    "intro": "Lewisia rediviva var. yosemitana, commonly known as the Yosemite Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant features succulent, basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
