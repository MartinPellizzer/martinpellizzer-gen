    "intro": "Lissochilus quadrilobus, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, intricately patterned flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive four-lobed lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. The botanical interest in this species lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the diverse orchid flora of the Andes."
