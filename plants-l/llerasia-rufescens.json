    "intro": "Llerasia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a waxy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by small berries that are edible for certain bird species. Llerasia rufescens is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments."
