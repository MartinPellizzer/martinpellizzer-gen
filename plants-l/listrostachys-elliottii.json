    "intro": "Listrostachys elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels, which are surrounded by brightly colored bracts. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its adaptability in wet environments."
