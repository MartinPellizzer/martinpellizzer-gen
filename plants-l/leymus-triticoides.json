    "intro": "Leymus triticoides, commonly known as wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Leymus triticoides is often used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
