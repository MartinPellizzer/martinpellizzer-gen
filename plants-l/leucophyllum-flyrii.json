    "intro": "Leucophyllum flyrii, commonly known as Texas betony, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
