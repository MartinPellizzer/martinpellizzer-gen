    "intro": "Lagochilus nuristanicus, commonly known as the Nuristan thyme, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, spherical fruits containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
