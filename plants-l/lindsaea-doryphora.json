    "intro": "Lindsaea doryphora, commonly known as the mountain hawksbeard, is a species of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered in dense, spiky formations on the underside of its leaves. Lindsaea doryphora plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
