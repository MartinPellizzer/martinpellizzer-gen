    "intro": "Lasthenia maritima, commonly known as the seaside dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along beaches and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
