    "intro": "Lepisanthes cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers emerge directly from the stems rather than from the tips of branches. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are often covered in a fuzzy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Lepisanthes cauliflora is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in traditional medicine."
