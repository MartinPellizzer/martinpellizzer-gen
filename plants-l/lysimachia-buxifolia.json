    "intro": "Lysimachia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded, evergreen leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
