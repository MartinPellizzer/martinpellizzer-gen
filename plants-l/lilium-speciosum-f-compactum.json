    "intro": "Lilium speciosum f. compactum, commonly known as the compact form of the showy lily, is a cultivated variant of the species Lilium speciosum. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which results in a more manageable plant compared to the standard form. The flowers are typically larger and more showy than those of the parent species, with a striking coloration that ranges from white to deep pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This form is often favored for its ornamental value and ease of maintenance in landscaped settings."
