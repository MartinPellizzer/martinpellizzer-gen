    "intro": "Litsea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf litsea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, and the fruit is a small, smooth drupe. Litsea sessilis is often found in lowland evergreen forests and is valued for its aromatic properties and potential use in traditional medicine."
