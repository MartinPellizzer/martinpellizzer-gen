    "intro": "Leptatherum, commonly known as fineleaf bluegrass, is a genus of grasses native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plants typically thrive in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Leptatherum species are often used in turfgrass mixes due to their fine texture and drought tolerance. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
