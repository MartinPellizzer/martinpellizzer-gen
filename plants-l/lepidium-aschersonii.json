    "intro": "Lepidium aschersonii, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Lepidium aschersonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
