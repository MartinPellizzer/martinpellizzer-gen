    "intro": "Lycopodiella longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodiella longipes is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
