    "intro": "Lepidostachys parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lepidostachys, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps retain moisture. Lepidostachys parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
