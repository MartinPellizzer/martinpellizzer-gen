It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its aromatic foliage has been traditionally used in Indigenous Australian medicine. Leptospermum subglabratum is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
