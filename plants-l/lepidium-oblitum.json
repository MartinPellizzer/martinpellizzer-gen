    "intro": "Lepidium oblitum, commonly known as the ghost weed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Lepidium oblitum is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
