    "intro": "Lycopodiella caroliniana var. tuberosa, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It has a creeping rhizome with erect, narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying ancient plant lineages and ecological succession."
