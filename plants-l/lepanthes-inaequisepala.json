It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with distinctively asymmetrical sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are often pale or greenish in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes inaequisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
