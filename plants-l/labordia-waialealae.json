It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
