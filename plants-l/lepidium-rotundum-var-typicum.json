It features small, rounded leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny white or green flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its seeds are small, oval, and often coated with a waxy layer, aiding in their dispersal. Peppergrass is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
