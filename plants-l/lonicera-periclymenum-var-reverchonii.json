It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The berries that follow the flowers are small, red, and edible, often attracting birds and other wildlife."
