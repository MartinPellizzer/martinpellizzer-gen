    "intro": "Lastrea saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Lastrea saxicola is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices, making it a hardy and resilient species well-suited to harsh environments."
