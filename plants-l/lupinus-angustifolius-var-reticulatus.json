    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. reticulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine with reticulate markings, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern of veins. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Lupinus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in agricultural settings."
