    "intro": "Lomagramma subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved lomagramma, is a member of the family Lomagrammaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are usually rough to the touch due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination. The species is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
