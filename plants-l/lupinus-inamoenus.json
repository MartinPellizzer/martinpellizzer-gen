    "intro": "Lupinus inamoenus, commonly known as the smooth lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of oval, serrated leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lupinus inamoenus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil ecosystems."
