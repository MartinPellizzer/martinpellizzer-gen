    "intro": "Lindsaea davallioides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming compact, cushion-like rosettes. Its leaves are usually dark green and covered in a fine, soft layer of trichomes, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Lindsaea davallioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
