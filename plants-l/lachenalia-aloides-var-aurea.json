    "intro": "Lachenalia aloides var. aurea, commonly known as the golden lachenalia, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment. It produces clusters of flowers on tall, slender stems, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is particularly noted for its vibrant color and adaptability to well-drained soils."
