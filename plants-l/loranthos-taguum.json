    "intro": "Loranthos taguum, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as teak and mango. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthos taguum plays a role in the ecological balance by providing food for certain wildlife species."
