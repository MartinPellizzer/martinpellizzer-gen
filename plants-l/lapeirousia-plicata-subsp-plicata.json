    "intro": "Lapeirousia plicata subsp. plicata, commonly known as the Cape bell orchid, is a striking South African orchid species characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. It belongs to the subfamily Orchidoideae and is native to the Western and Northern Cape provinces. The plant features a short, stocky stem with clustered, bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble miniature bells. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss."
