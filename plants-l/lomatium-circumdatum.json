    "intro": "Lomatium circumdatum, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use, though it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Lomatium circumdatum plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and soil health."
