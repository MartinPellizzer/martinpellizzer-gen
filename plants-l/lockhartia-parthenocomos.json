    "intro": "Lockhartia parthenocomos, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique coloration and floral structure make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical studies."
