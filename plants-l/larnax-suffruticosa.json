    "intro": "Larnax suffruticosa, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has dark green, rough-textured leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark, shiny berries in the autumn. Its berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance. Larnax suffruticosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
