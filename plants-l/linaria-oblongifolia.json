    "intro": "Linaria oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that resemble small toadflax blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is an annual or biennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Linaria oblongifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
