    "intro": "Leptotes bicolor var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue and white petals that resemble bells, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have serrated edges, contributing to its botanical distinction. It blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant touch of color to the forest floor."
