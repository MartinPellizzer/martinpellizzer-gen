    "intro": "Linaria pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Linaria pycnophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
