    "intro": "Liparis warpurii, commonly known as the Warpur's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
