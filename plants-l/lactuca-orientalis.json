    "intro": "Lactuca orientalis, commonly known as oriental lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into small, prickly fruits called achenes. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Lactuca orientalis is also known for containing lactucine, a sesquiterpene lactone with potential medicinal properties."
