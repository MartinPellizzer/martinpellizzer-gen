    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. exerythra, commonly known as the red-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. This subspecies is distinguished by its striking red flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink blooms of the standard Linnaea borealis. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves and has a creeping growth habit with aerial runners. Its unique floral coloration makes it a sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
