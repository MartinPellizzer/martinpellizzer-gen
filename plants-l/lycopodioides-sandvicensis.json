    "intro": "Lycopodioides sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
