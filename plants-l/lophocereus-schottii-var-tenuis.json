    "intro": "Lophocereus schottii var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spine-tipped tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is a drought-tolerant plant adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
