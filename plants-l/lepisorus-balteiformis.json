    "intro": "Lepisorus balteiformis, commonly known as the broad-banded fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
