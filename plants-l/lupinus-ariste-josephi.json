It is characterized by its tall, spindly growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated seed pods that contain several small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
