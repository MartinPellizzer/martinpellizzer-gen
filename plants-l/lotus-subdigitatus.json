    "intro": "Lotus subdigitatus, commonly known as the subdigitate lotus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique subdigitate leaf structure, which resembles fingers spreading from a central point, is a distinguishing botanical feature. The lotus is also noted for its ability to purify water, making it ecologically significant in its native environment."
