    "intro": "Lonicera, commonly known as honeysuckle, is a genus of about 180 species of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or vines, characterized by their opposite, simple, and usually deciduous leaves. They produce fragrant, tubular flowers that are often yellow or orange, followed by berries that range from red to black. Lonicera species are widely cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine. Some species are invasive in certain regions, posing ecological challenges."
