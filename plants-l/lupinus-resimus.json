    "intro": "Lupinus resimus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clustered, spiny pods. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it is adapted to salty and wind-swept conditions. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus resimus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
