    "intro": "Linaria anticaria subsp. cuartanensis, commonly known as the Cuartana toadflax, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as dry grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
