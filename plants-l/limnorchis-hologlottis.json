    "intro": "Limnorchis hologlottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Limnorchis hologlottis plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
