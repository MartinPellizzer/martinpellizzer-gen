    "intro": "Lotodes erianthum, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
