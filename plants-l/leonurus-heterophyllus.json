    "intro": "Leonurus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable hound's-tongue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble a dog's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
