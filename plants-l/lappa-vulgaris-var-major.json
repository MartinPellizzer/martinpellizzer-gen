    "intro": "Lappa vulgaris var. major, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which are followed by long, slender fruits containing seeds. It is characterized by its milky, photosensitive sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
