It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
