    "intro": "Leptormus caledonicus, commonly known as the Caledonian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Scotland. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pale yellow or greenish-white blossoms that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from habitat loss and environmental changes."
