    "intro": "Lavatera occidentalis, commonly known as the Western woollypod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in native landscapes."
