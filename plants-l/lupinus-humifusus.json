    "intro": "Lupinus humifusus, commonly known as the creeping lupine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its mat-forming habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus humifusus is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
