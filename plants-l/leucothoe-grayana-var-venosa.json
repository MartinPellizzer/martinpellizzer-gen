    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with striking white or cream variegation, which adds visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant in shaded gardens."
