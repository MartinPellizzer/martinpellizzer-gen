It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Lespedeza bracteolata is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
