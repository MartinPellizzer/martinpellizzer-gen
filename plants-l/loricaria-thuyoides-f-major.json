    "intro": "Loricaria thuyoides f. major, commonly known as the large-leaf water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth characterized by its larger, more robust leaves. It is an aquatic plant native to South America, typically found in slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has floating leaves that are often bluish-green in color and produce small, showy purple flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and can spread rapidly, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
