    "intro": "Lepisorus mishmica, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually pinnately compound. Lepisorus mishmica plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its natural habitat."
