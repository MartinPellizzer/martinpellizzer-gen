It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is known for its succulent species adapted to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the winter months. Lithocardium revolutum is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
