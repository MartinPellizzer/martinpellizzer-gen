    "intro": "Lloydia serotina var. flava, commonly known as the yellow lloydia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and prefers moist, sandy soils. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
