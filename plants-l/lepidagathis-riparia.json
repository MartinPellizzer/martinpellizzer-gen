    "intro": "Lepidagathis riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and riparian habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies along riverbanks and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in aquatic environments. Lepidagathis riparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
