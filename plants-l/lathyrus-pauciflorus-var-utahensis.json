    "intro": "Lathyrus pauciflorus var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
