    "intro": "Lolium strictum var. tenue, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in forage and erosion control."
