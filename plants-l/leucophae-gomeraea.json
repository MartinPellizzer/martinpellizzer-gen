    "intro": "Leucophae gomeraea, commonly known as the Gomera lichen, is a rare and endemic lichen species found exclusively on the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its pale, whitish to pale yellowish thallus. The lichen forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid microhabitats. It is considered a relict species, surviving in isolated pockets due to its specific ecological requirements. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and vulnerable organism."
