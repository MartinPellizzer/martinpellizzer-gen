    "intro": "Lirianthe liliifera var. angatensis, commonly known as the Angatensis lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
