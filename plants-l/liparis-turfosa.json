    "intro": "Liparis turfosa, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense mat of leaf-like structures that resemble moss, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Liparis turfosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
