    "intro": "Lonicera diervilla, commonly known as barrenberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Lonicera diervilla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value is limited due to its lack of showy foliage, but it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
