    "intro": "Loranthus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Populus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can eventually cover the entire branch, potentially weakening the host tree over time. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. This species is often found in temperate regions and is considered both a parasitic and ecologically significant plant."
