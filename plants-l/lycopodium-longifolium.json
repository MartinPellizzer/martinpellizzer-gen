    "intro": "Lycopodium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces sporophylls, which are modified leaves that bear the sporangia containing spores. Lycopodium longifolium typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
