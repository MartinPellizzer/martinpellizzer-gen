    "intro": "Lepidium coronopifolium f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth peppergrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other forms of Lepidium. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed environments."
