It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Lyonia chapaensis is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in high-altitude environments."
