    "intro": "Lupinaster pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific lupinaster, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it prefers full sun and well-drained conditions."
