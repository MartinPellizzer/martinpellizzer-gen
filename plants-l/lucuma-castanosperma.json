    "intro": "Lucuma castanosperma, commonly known as lucuma, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its large, oval-shaped fruits that resemble a cross between a lemon and a sweet potato. The fruit has a thick, inedible outer husk and contains a single, starchy, yellowish pulp that is rich in nutrients. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit. Its botanical features make it an important crop in traditional Andean agriculture."
