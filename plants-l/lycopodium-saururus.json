    "intro": "Lycopodium saururus, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Lycopodium saururus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
