    "intro": "Licania sclerophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. It produces small, clustered white flowers followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Licania sclerophylla thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
