    "intro": "Lavandula stoechas f. parvibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted lavender, is a cultivar of the Spanish lavender. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flower spikes compared to the typical species. The plant features silver-gray foliage and produces fragrant, purple-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
