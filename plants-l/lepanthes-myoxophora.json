    "intro": "Lepanthes myoxophora, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique blooming pattern and specialized pollination mechanism make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
