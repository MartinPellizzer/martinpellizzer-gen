    "intro": "Liparis elegantula, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, greenish-white flowers with prominent violet markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Liparis elegantula is considered a threatened species in many regions."
