    "intro": "Lampranthus lunulatus, commonly known as the moonflower or white starling plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its foliage consists of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
