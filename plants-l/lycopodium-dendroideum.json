    "intro": "Lycopodium dendroideum, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of ancient seedless plants. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium dendroideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
