    "intro": "Leptopus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems and roots are anchored in the substrate. The hairy bladderwort is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
