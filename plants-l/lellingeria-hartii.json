    "intro": "Lellingeria hartii, commonly known as the Hartii's orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy of dense rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, while its leaves are broad and waxy to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lellingeria hartii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
