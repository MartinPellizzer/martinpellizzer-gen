    "intro": "Lachnostachys coolgardiensis f. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spurred lachnostachys, is a rare and specialized grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, short, dense inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its alpine environment, with narrow leaves and a low profile to minimize exposure to harsh weather conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs during the short growing season of its habitat, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
