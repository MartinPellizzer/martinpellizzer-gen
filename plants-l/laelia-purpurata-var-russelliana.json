    "intro": "Laelia purpurata var. russelliana, commonly known as the Russell's orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in both indoor and greenhouse settings."
