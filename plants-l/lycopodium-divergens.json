    "intro": "Lycopodium divergens, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit with numerous small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the foliage. Lycopodium divergens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems."
