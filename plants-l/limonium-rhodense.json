    "intro": "Limonium rhodense, commonly known as the pink sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Limonium rhodense is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
