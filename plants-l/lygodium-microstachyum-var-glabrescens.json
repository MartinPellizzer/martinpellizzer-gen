    "intro": "Lygodium microstachyum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous fern, is a species of climbing fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a smooth, hairless texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate and elegant appearance."
