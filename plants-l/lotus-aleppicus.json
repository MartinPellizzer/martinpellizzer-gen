    "intro": "Lotus aleppicus, commonly known as the Syrian water-lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, which provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies. Lotus aleppicus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments like ponds and lakes."
