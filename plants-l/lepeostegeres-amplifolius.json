    "intro": "Lepeostegeres amplifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a common reproductive feature among ferns. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
