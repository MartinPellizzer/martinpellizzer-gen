    "intro": "Lippia polycephala, commonly known as Mexican mint or wild mint, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their strong, menthol-like scent. Lippia polycephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
