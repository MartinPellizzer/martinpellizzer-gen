    "intro": "Lysipomia laciniata subsp. microsperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lyssipoma, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
