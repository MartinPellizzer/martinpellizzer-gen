    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis alpina subsp. minima, commonly known as the alpine leucanthemum, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer. Its compact growth habit and frost resistance make it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
