    "intro": "Linanthus androsaceus var. croceus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its vivid yellow floral color, setting it apart from other members of the species."
