    "intro": "Lespedeza cuneata, commonly known as Chinese strangleweed, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and can form dense stands, making it an invasive species in some regions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Lespedeza cuneata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
