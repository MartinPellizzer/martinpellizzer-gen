    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia subsp. dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
