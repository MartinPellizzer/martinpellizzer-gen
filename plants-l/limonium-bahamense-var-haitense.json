    "intro": "Limonium bahamense var. haitense, commonly known as the Haitian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region, particularly Haiti and the Bahamas. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and dune environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
