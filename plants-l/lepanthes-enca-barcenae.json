    "intro": "Lepanthes enca-barcenae, commonly known as the Barcena's urn orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid tropical forests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flower that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, fleshy leaf and produces a single, showy flower at the top. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
