    "intro": "Lantana reticulata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lantana, is a compact shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, adding a delicate contrast to its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and tropical climates. However, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
