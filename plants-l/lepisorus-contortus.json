    "intro": "Lepisorus contortus, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, curling fronds that give it a distinctive, almost spiral appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Lepisorus contortus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
