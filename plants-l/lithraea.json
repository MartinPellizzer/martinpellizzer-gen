It consists of a single species, Lithraea mollicoma, which is native to South America. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange-red fruits that are capsule-like. Lithraea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
