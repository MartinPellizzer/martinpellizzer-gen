    "intro": "Lupinus macrorhizos, commonly known as the large-rooted lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus macrorhizos is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it valuable for soil enrichment."
