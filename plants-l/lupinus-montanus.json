    "intro": "Lupinus montanus, commonly known as the mountain lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. Lupinus montanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
