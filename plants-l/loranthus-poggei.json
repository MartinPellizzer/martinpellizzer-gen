    "intro": "Loranthus poggei, commonly known as the Pogge's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Loranthus poggei is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
