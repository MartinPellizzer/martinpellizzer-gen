    "intro": "Leptopogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions, often in alpine or subalpine environments. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, tussock-forming growth habit. Leptopogon species are often adapted to harsh climates, with some exhibiting cold tolerance and resistance to drought. Their ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
