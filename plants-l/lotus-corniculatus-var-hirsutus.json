    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy bird's-foot trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet with a small, hooked protrusion resembling a bird's foot. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a rough texture, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
