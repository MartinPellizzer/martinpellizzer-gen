The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
