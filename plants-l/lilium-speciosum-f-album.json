    "intro": "Lilium speciosum f. album, commonly known as the white lily, is a cultivar of the species Lilium speciosum, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This variety is distinguished by its striking white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. The flowers are not only ornamental but also have a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
