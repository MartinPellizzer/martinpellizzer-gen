    "intro": "Leucopogon hirtellus var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically covered in fine, short hairs, though the variety glabrifolius has a smoother texture. It thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in pine forests or heathlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
