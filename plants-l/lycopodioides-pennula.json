    "intro": "Lycopodioides pennula, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides pennula plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in cup-like formations called synangia."
