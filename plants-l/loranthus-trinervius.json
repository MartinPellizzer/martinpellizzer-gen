    "intro": "Loranthus trinervius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that contain sticky seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
