It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the mustard family. Its seeds are small and contained within siliques, which are dry, dehiscent fruits. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to ecological diversity in such environments."
