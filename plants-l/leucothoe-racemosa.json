It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that persist into winter, providing food for wildlife. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
