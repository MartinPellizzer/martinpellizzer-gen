It is characterized by its striking red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features lance-shaped, narrow leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Lobelia brachyantha is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
