    "intro": "Lodhra coronata, commonly known as the sacred bell flower, is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Lodhra coronata is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
