    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. trigonoides, commonly known as the triangular twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves, which set it apart from the typical ovate leaves of the species. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of two. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. This form is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
