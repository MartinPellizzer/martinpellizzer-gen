    "intro": "Lasiochlamys koghiensis, commonly known as the Koghi mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name, \"lasiochlamys\" meaning \"hairy calyx.\" It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
