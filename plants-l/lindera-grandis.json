    "intro": "Lindera grandis, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. Its leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
