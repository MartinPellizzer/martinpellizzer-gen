    "intro": "Lilium humboldtii var. ocellatum, commonly known as the Humboldt lily with a spotted pattern, is a striking bulbous perennial native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers with distinctive white petals and a prominent red or orange spot at the base. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
