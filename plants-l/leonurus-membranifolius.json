It is a perennial herb native to southern Africa, characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Leonurus membranifolius is typically found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
