    "intro": "Lepistemum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of aerial roots that help it adhere to surfaces. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface. Lepistemum species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. They play an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
