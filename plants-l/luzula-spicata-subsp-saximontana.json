It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Cyperaceae family."
