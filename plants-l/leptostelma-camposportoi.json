    "intro": "Leptostelma camposportoi, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a species of liverwort found primarily in tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lophoziaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often star-shaped thallus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or soil in humid forests. Its structure consists of a prostrate or erect stem with leaf-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Leptostelma camposportoi plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
