    "intro": "Lepanthes oxapampaensis, commonly known as the Oxapampa orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes oxapampaensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
