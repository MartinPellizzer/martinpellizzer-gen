    "intro": "Lycium mediterraneum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth boxthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, thornless branches that are covered in small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats."
