    "intro": "Logania longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved logania, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
