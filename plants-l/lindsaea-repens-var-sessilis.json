    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. sessilis, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground and produce clusters of small, delicate fronds. The fronds are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
