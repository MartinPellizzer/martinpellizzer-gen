    "intro": "Lemna landoltii, commonly known as the landolt's duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of its fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can quickly form dense mats on the water surface."
