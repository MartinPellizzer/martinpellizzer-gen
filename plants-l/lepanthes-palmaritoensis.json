    "intro": "Lepanthes palmaritoensis, commonly known as the Palmarito Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as white, yellow, or orange. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes palmaritoensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
