    "intro": "Lindsaea kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on the trunks of trees in montane rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Lindsaea kinabaluensis is considered a vulnerable species."
