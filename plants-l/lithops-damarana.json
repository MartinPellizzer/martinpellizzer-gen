    "intro": "Lithops damarana, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for stones due to their shape and color. The plant stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Lithops damarana is well adapted to rocky soils and requires minimal water and sunlight."
