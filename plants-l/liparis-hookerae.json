It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
