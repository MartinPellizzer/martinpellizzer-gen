    "intro": "Leucopogon adpressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and evergreen plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
