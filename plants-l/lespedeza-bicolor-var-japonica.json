    "intro": "Lespedeza bicolor var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese clover, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are similar to those of other clover species, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Lespedeza bicolor var. japonica is often used in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
