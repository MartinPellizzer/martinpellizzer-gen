    "intro": "Lysimachia capitellata, commonly known as the mossy yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lysimachia capitellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
