    "intro": "Leptothrium, commonly known as the fern moss or small fern moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae. These plants are typically small, mat-forming, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. They lack true leaves and instead have structures called thallus, which are flattened, leaf-like bodies. Leptothrium species are often found in temperate regions and are characterized by their intricate, delicate leaf arrangements. Their reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are usually small and clustered, contributing to their role in ecological systems."
