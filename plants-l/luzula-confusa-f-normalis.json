    "intro": "Luzula confusa f. normalis, commonly known as the common wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, upright leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces three-sided, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
