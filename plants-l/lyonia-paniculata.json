    "intro": "Lyonia paniculata, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Lyonia paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
