    "intro": "Laccosperma opacum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Laccosperma opacum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
