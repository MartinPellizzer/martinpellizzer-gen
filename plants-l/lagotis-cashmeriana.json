    "intro": "Lagotis cashmeriana, commonly known as the Kashmir bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. The flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
