    "intro": "Lycopodium patulum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that produce spores rather than seeds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its root system consists of rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
