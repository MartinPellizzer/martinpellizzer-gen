It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically bright yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
