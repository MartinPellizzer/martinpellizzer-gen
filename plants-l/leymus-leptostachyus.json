    "intro": "Leymus leptostachyus, commonly known as the slender-stalked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces slender spikelets with short, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
