    "intro": "Lupinus javanicus, commonly known as the Java lupine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in the spring and summer. Lupinus javanicus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
