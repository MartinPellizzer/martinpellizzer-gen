    "intro": "Lupinus puracensis, commonly known as the Peruvian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched flower clusters that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus puracensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life in its habitat."
