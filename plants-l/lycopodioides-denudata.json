It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its simple, needle-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Lycopodioides denudata has a unique reproductive system that relies on spores rather than seeds. Its structure reflects the evolutionary traits of early land plants, showcasing features like rhizomes and microphylls."
