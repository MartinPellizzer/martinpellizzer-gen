    "intro": "Lycopodium selago, commonly known as the cliff clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along sea cliffs and coastal dunes. The plant has a prostrate or upright growth habit, with branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporophylls, are clustered in dense, cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium selago is adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used as an indicator of maritime climate conditions."
