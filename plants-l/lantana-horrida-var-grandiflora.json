    "intro": "Lantana horrida var. grandiflora, commonly known as the purple lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
