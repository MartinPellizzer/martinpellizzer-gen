It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with two lips, typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
