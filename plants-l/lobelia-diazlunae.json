    "intro": "Lobelia diazlunae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, mountainous habitat. Lobelia diazlunae is an important component of the local flora and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and climate change."
