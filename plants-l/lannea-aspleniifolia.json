    "intro": "Lannea aspleniifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant has simple, alternate, and often lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Lannea aspleniifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
