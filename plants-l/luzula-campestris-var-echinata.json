    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. echinata, commonly known as the spiked wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color and produce small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
