    "intro": "Loranthus grandifrons, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-orange flowers that are often clustered in groups. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in forest canopies."
