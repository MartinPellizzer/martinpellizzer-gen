    "intro": "Lewisia purdyi, commonly known as the Purdy's Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Lewisia purdyi is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
