    "intro": "Lycopodium confertum var. barrosii, commonly known as the Barros's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia responsible for releasing spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is notable for its morphological distinctiveness and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
