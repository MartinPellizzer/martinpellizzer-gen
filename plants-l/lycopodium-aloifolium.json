    "intro": "Lycopodium aloifolium, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, often on cliffs or in sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in capsules that are borne on short, stalked structures called sporophylls. Lycopodium aloifolium is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
