It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries are red and edible, though they are often consumed by birds. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
