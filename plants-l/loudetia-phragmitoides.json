It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
