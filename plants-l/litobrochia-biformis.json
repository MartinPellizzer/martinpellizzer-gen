    "intro": "Litobrochia biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky, alpine environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with two distinct lobes. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms a compact, low-growing rosette. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
