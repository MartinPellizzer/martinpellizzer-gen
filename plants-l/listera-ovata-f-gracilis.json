    "intro": "Listera ovata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender basketwort, is a rare and delicate variant of the basketwort species. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family, characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its slender stems and reduced leaf size distinguish it from the typical form of Listera ovata. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native ecosystems."
