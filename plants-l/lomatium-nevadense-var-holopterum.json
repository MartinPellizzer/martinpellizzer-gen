    "intro": "Lomatium nevadense var. holopterum, commonly known as the Sierra lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a bluish-gray hue, while its flowers are small and white or pale green. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf structure compared to other lomatium species."
