    "intro": "Lithops viridis, commonly known as the \"Fairy Fan\" or \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Lithops viridis is known for its ability to mimic the surrounding environment, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
