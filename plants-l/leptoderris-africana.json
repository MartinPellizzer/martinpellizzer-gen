    "intro": "Leptoderris africana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its dense, heavy timber is highly valued for carving and musical instruments, though overharvesting has led to its classification as vulnerable."
