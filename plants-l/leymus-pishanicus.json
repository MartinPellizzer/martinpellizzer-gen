It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Leymus pishanicus has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in steppe and desert steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
