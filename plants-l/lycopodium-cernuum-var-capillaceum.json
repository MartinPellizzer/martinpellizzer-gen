    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. capillaceum, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its foliage is often used in horticultural arrangements due to its delicate, feathery appearance. This variety is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, which give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance."
