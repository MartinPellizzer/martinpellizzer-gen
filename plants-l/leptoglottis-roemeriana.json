    "intro": "Leptoglottis roemeriana, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Leptoglottis roemeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
