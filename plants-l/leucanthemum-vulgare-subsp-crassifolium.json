    "intro": "Leucanthemum vulgare subsp. crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf white ragwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Leucanthemum vulgare*. The plant produces yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
