    "intro": "Lupinus formosus, commonly known as the Mexican lupine, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus formosus is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
