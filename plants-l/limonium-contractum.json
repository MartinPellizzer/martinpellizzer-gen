    "intro": "Limonium contractum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Limonium contractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
