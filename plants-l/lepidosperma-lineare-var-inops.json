It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in summer. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to waterlogged soils, with rhizomes that help in anchoring and nutrient absorption."
