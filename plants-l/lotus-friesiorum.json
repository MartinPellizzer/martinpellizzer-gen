    "intro": "Lotus friesiorum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, bloom above the water, symbolizing purity in many cultures. The lotus is also valued for its edible seeds and roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and cuisine for centuries."
