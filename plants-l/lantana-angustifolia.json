    "intro": "Lantana angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lantana, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom sequentially throughout the growing season. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woods. Lantana angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal but can become invasive in certain regions."
