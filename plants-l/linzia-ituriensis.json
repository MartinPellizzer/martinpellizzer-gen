It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and heart-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linzia ituriensis is considered a rare and less-studied species."
