    "intro": "Lachnaea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thick, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive, dark green to blackish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure includes a cortex, medulla, and a layer of photobionts. Lachnaea crassifolia is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions."
