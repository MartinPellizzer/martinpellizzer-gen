It features striking red or pink foliage that becomes more vivid under intense lighting and nutrient-rich conditions. This plant is often used in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for small aquatic life. It thrives in tropical freshwater environments and requires moderate to high water temperatures. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize substrates quickly and densely."
