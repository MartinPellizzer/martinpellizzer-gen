    "intro": "Lachemilla uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy pink or purple flower at the center of each rosette, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Lachemilla uniflora is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
