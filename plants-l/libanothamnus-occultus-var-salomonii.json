    "intro": "Libanothamnus occultus var. salomonii, commonly known as the Solomon's thyme, is a rare and endemic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Chile. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its botanical features include a compact growth form and a unique fragrance, which may contribute to its ecological role in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
