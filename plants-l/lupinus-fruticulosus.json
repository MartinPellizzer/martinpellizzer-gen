    "intro": "Lupinus fruticulosus, commonly known as the prickly lupin, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lupinus fruticulosus is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are edible when properly prepared, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful processing."
