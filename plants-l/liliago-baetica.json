    "intro": "Liliago baetica, commonly known as the Iberian lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Spain. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Liliago baetica is considered endangered and is protected in several areas."
