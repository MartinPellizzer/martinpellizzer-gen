    "intro": "Lunaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine moonflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white, spherical seed pods that resemble tiny moons, giving it its common name. These seed pods split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Lunaria alpina is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
