    "intro": "Limeum viscosum f. longepedunculatum, commonly known as the sticky lime or woolly lime, is a unique variant of the lime tree characterized by its viscid, sticky leaves. This form exhibits elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting the inflorescences, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soils. Its foliage is thick and waxy, with a distinctive sticky texture that helps deter herbivores. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often followed by yellowish-green fruits, making it both ornamental and potentially useful in horticulture."
