    "intro": "Lepanthes simplex, commonly known as the simple slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and it often forms dense colonies in its natural habitat. Lepanthes simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral morphology."
