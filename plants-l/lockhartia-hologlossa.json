    "intro": "Lockhartia hologlossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, elegant white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on humid, shaded environments for survival. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the late afternoon, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Lockhartia hologlossa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
