    "intro": "Lygodictyon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. Lygodictyon species are adapted to saline and sandy environments, making them resilient to harsh coastal conditions. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The genus includes several species, with Lygodictyon calycosum being one of the most well-known."
