    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis subsp. graminea, commonly known as the cardinalflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender, grass-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. Its flowers are tubular and bilaterally symmetrical, a characteristic feature of the Campanulaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to the typical Lobelia cardinalis."
