    "intro": "Lesquerella alpina var. parvula, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. This variant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compact growth habit, often thriving in rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain oily seeds, which have been studied for their potential industrial applications. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
