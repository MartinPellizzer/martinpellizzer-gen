    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional agriculture."
