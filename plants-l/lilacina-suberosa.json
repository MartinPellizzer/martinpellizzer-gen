    "intro": "Lilacina suberosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its woody, often rugged stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Lilacina suberosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
