    "intro": "Lithocardium gerascanthus, commonly known as the Gerascanthous rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. Lithocardium gerascanthus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
