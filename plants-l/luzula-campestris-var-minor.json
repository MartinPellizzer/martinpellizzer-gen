    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf wood rush, is a low-growing, perennial plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences that produce pale blue to greenish flowers. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form compact clumps. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
