    "intro": "Lepanthes yuvilensis, commonly known as the Yuvilensis orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes yuvilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
