    "intro": "Laurelia, commonly known as the incense cedar, is a genus of evergreen trees belonging to the family Cupressaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. Laurelia species are native to the western coast of the United States and parts of South America, thriving in coastal and mountainous regions. The wood of laurelia is highly valued for its durability and fragrance, often used in cabinetry and furniture. Additionally, the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
