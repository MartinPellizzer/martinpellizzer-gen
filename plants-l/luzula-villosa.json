    "intro": "Luzula villosa, commonly known as the hairy wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Luzula villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
