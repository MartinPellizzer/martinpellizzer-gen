    "intro": "Lycium morongii var. indutum, commonly known as the hairy boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. The plant has dense, spiny foliage that provides habitat for various desert organisms. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
