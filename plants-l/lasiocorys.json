    "intro": "Lasiocorys, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plants typically have hairy stems and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, red, or purple. Lasiocorys species are often found in warm climates and are adapted to thrive in disturbed soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
