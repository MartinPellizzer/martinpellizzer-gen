    "intro": "Lastrea cristata, commonly known as the crested mouse tail cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with small, spiny stems that give it a distinctive, mouse-tail-like appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
