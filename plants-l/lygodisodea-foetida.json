    "intro": "Lygodisodea foetida, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and often grows in moist, shaded environments. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. This odor is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
