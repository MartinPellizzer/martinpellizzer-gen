    "intro": "Loranthus kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Sapindaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to southern China and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host if left unchecked."
