    "intro": "Lesquerella recurvata, commonly known as the narrowleaf lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, capsule-like structure, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Lesquerella recurvata is also valued for its potential in biofuel and industrial applications due to its high oil content."
