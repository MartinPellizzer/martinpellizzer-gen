    "intro": "Lepturus repens var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern creeping lepturus, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that spread along the ground. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-white, and appear in clusters near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its adaptability to cool, humid climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
