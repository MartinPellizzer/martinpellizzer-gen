    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii var. laui, commonly known as the Laui Lobivia, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in dry, well-drained soils."
