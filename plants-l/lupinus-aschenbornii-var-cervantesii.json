    "intro": "Lupinus aschenbornii var. cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
