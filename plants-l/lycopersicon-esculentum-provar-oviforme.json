    "intro": "Lycopersicon esculentum provar. oviforme, commonly known as the oval tomato, is a botanical variant of the domesticated tomato. It is characterized by its ovular or egg-shaped fruits, which are typically larger and have a more elongated form compared to standard tomatoes. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family and is a herbaceous perennial in its native habitat, though it is often cultivated as an annual. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that develop into the characteristic red, fleshy fruits. This variety is valued for its unique shape and potential use in both culinary and ornamental applications."
