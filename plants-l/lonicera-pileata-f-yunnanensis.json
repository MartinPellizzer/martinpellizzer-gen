    "intro": "Lonicera pileata f. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan honeysuckle, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to China. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade. This variety is a popular choice for hedging and as a decorative plant in subtropical climates."
