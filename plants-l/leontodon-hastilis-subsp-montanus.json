    "intro": "Leontodon hastilis subsp. montanus, commonly known as the mountain hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellowish to orange composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
