    "intro": "Leptaspis tararaensis, commonly known as the Tarara leafhopper, is a small, winged insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its slender body and elongated wings. The plant it feeds on is primarily the tarara tree, which is a type of mistletoe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host-specific herbivore, influencing the ecology of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range and specific host plant, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
