It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native landscapes."
