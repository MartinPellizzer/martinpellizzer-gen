    "intro": "Lobelia prostrata, commonly known as creeping lobelia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lobelia prostrata is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
