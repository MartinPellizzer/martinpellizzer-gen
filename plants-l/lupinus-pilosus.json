    "intro": "Lupinus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy lupin, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has feathery, pinnate leaves and produces seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus pilosus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
