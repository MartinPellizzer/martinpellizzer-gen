    "intro": "Limniris versicolor, commonly known as the variable water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a range of colors from green to reddish hues. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, typically opening in the early morning. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Limniris versicolor plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
