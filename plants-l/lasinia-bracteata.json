    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lasi\u00f1a bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
