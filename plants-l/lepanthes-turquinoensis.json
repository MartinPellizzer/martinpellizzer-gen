    "intro": "Lepanthes turquinoensis, commonly known as the Turquino orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically display shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the cloud forests of the Sierra Maestra mountain range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
