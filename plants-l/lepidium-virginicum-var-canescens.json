    "intro": "Lepidium virginicum var. canescens, commonly known as the hoary cress, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has hairy, often grayish foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small white or yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, capsule-like structure that aids in its dispersal by wind or animals."
