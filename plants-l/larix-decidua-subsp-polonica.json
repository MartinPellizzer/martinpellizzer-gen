    "intro": "Larix decidua subsp. polonica, commonly known as the Polish larch, is a subspecies of the European larch native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the autumn, distinguishing it from most other larch species. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in harsh alpine environments."
