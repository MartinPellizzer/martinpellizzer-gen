    "intro": "Lepanthes confusa, commonly known as the confused urn-orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration with intricate patterns. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches to trees without being parasitic. Lepanthes confusa is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
