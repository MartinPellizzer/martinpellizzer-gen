    "intro": "Lithocardium longipedum var. eriophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lithocardium, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a valued addition to succulent collections."
