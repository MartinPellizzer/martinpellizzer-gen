    "intro": "Lindsaea longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with roots that anchor it without parasitizing its host. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with small, clustered sporangia on the underside. Lindsaea longipetiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
