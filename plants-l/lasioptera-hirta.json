    "intro": "Lasioptera hirta, commonly known as the hairy lichen moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and is typically found on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex thalloid structure with both upper and lower surfaces covered in fine, hairy structures. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its cryptic appearance, it is sometimes overlooked in ecological surveys but plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation."
