It is a cross between two species of lupine, typically Lupinus leucophyllus and Lupinus argenteus, resulting in a plant with distinctive silver-green foliage. The flowers are usually blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
