    "intro": "Leidesia procumbens var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf leidesia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
