It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
