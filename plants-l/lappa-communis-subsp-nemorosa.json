    "intro": "Lappa communis subsp. nemorosa, commonly known as the European hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or greenish flowers. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways and in woodland edges. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to skin when exposed to sunlight."
