    "intro": "Lomanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that often float on the water's surface. The flowers of Lomanthus typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white, and they have a unique structure with a spadix surrounded by an enlarged spathe. The genus includes several species, such as Lomanthus tenuis and Lomanthus longiflorus, which are valued for their ornamental beauty and cultural significance. Lomanthus plants thrive in still or slow-moving water and are often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
