    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 brownii var. punicea, commonly known as the red honeysuckle, is a hybrid deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
