    "intro": "Lysiloma polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Lysiloma polyphyllum is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping."
