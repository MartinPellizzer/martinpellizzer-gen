    "intro": "Lycaste macrobulbon, commonly known as the giant bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often in vibrant shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a single, thick pseudobulb that serves as a storage organ for water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-draining soil, making it suitable for cultivation in humid environments. Lycaste macrobulbon is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its dramatic blooms and unique appearance."
