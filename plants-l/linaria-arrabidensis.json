    "intro": "Linaria arrabidensis, commonly known as the desert toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, resembling those of the snapdragon genus. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Linaria arrabidensis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand extreme temperatures."
