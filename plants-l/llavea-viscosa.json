    "intro": "Llavea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky llavea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
