It is characterized by its small, flattened, green thallus that often grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or soil. The plant exhibits a distinct crenate margin, giving it a scalloped appearance. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
