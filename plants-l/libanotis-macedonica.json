The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in mountainous areas of Greece, Albania, and North Macedonia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
