    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. marianum, commonly known as the Marianum clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clustered sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its propagation. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates."
