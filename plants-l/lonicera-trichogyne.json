The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several small seeds. Lonicera trichogyne is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
