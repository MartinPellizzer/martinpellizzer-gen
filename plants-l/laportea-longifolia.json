    "intro": "Laportea longifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp willow, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture on the upper surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Laportea longifolia is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
