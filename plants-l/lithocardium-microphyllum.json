    "intro": "Lithocardium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, orbicular leaves that are typically covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are relatively small but numerous. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Lithocardium microphyllum is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
