    "intro": "Leptosiphon pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf fairy-bluebell, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
