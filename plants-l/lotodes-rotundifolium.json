    "intro": "Lotodes rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water edges and providing habitat for aquatic life."
