    "intro": "Linum kingii, commonly known as King's flax, is a flowering plant native to South Australia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linum kingii thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh native habitat."
