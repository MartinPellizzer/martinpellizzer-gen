    "intro": "Lithocarpus matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to Japan, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and robust, woody structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by hard, nut-like fruits that are often enclosed in a spiky husk. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, and the tree is valued for its durable wood and ecological role in forest ecosystems. Lithocarpus matsudae thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
