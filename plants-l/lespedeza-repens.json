    "intro": "Lespedeza repens, commonly known as prostrate lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Lespedeza repens is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
