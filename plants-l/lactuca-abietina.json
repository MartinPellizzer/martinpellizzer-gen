    "intro": "Lactuca abietina, commonly known as the alpine lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Lactuca abietina is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a wild edible."
