    "intro": "Leucocoma alpina, commonly known as the alpine white bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Leucocoma alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native habitat."
