It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and has been used historically by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Lomatium ambiguum is also an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
