    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. pseudocontiguum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its spore-producing cones and needle-like leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions with temperate climates. The plant typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms. Its sporophytes are often clustered in dense groups, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The species is noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a characteristic component of ancient forest ecosystems."
