    "intro": "Lobelia limburgensis, commonly known as the Limburg lobelia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Netherlands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves and is often found in small, isolated populations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
