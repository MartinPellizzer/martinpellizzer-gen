    "intro": "Lepanthes fibulifera, commonly known as the fibrous-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes fibulifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations."
