    "intro": "Lumnitzera montana, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate water absorption. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lumnitzera montana plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine life."
