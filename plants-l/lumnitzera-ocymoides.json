    "intro": "Lumnitzera ocymoides, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a halophyte, meaning it can thrive in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and estuaries. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a fleshy, edible berry that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals."
