    "intro": "Leptospermum polygalifolium subsp. montanum, commonly known as the mountain tea tree, is a shrub native to the cooler regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. Its foliage is aromatic and contains high levels of essential oils, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance. The subspecies is adapted to mild, temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
