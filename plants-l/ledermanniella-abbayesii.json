    "intro": "Ledermanniella abbayesii, commonly known as the Abbaye lichen, is a rare and specialized species of lichen that thrives in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to rock surfaces. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients and water. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors or on shaded cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
