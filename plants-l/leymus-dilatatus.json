    "intro": "Leymus dilatatus, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes. Leymus dilatatus is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in restoration ecology."
