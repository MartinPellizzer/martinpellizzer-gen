    "intro": "Liparis truncicola, commonly known as the dwarf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features a dense, grass-like foliage and produces long, spiraled spikes of white to pale purple flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in horticultural cultivation for their ornamental value. Liparis truncicola is a relatively small species, reaching heights of only a few inches, making it a delicate and rare addition to the orchid family."
