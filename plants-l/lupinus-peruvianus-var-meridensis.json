It features tall, erect stems with dense clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
