    "intro": "Larix leptolepis f. minor, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf larch, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the Japanese larch. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
