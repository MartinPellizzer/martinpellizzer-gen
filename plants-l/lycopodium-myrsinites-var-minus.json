    "intro": "Lycopodium myrsinites var. minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are scale-like and closely appressed to the stems, forming a dense, moss-like appearance. This variety is often found in the understory of temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
