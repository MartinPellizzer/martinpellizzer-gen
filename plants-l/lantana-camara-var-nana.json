    "intro": "Lantana camara var. nana, commonly known as dwarf lantana, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
