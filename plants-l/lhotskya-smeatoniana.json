    "intro": "Lhotskya smeatoniana, commonly known as the Smeaton's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
