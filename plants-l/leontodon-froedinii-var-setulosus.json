    "intro": "Leontodon froedinii var. setulosus, commonly known as the hairy leontodon, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
