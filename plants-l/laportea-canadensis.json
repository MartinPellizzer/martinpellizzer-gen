    "intro": "Laportea canadensis, commonly known as Canada hempnut, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Laportea canadensis is often found in moist woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
