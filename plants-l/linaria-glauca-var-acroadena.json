    "intro": "Linaria glauca var. acroadena, commonly known as the blue toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. The plant features slender, branched stems and produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
