    "intro": "Labichea buettneriana, commonly known as the Buetner's labichea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
