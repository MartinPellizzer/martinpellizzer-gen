It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
