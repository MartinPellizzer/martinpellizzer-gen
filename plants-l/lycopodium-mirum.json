    "intro": "Lycopodium mirum, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height. It produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically scale-like and lack true veins. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with sporangia clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky soils. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
