    "intro": "Lemma quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant's most notable feature is its four-leaf variant, which is considered a symbol of good fortune. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers. Lemma quadrifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
