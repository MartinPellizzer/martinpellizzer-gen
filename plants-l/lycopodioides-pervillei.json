It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Lycopodioides pervillei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
