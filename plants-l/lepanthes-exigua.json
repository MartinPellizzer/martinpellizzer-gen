    "intro": "Lepanthes exigua, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the tiny violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually pale violet or white, with intricate patterns on the petals. Lepanthes exigua has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and often endangered species in its native range."
