    "intro": "Limnostachys, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by their floating leaves and showy flowers. These plants typically grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Limnostachys species have broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to repel water. Their flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, are usually borne on long stems above the water surface. The genus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
