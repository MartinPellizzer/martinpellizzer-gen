    "intro": "Lathyrus tetrapterus, commonly known as the four-lobed vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided, with four leaflets on each stem, giving it its scientific name. Lathyrus tetrapterus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
