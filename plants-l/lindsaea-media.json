    "intro": "Lindsaea media, commonly known as the common lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and dense clusters of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lindsaea media is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
