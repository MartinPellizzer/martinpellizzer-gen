    "intro": "Lupulus orbicularis, commonly known as the spherical hop, is a unique species within the hop genus. It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly round, leaves, which distinguish it from other hop varieties. The plant is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its botanical features include serrated leaf margins and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Lupulus orbicularis is primarily of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution."
