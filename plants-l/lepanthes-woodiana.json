    "intro": "Lepanthes woodiana, commonly known as the Wood's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as pink, red, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid tropical environment. Lepanthes woodiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist conditions."
