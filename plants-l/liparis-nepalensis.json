It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or soil substrates.
