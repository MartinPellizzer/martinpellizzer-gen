    "intro": "Lycopodium struthioloides, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium struthioloides is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical and ecological importance."
