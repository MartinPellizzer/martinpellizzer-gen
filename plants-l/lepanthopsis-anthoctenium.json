It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with a distinctive purple lip. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
