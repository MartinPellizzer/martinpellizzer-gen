    "intro": "Leymus pacificus, commonly known as Pacific Leymus, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and coastal bluffs. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand salt spray and strong winds. Leymus pacificus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
