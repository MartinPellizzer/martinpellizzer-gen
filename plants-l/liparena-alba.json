    "intro": "Liparena alba, commonly known as the white sandplant, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss. Liparena alba is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
