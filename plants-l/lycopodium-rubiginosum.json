It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features whorled leaves that are linear and often have a reddish or rust-colored appearance, giving it its common name. It produces small, cone-like strobila at the base of its stems, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium rubiginosum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
