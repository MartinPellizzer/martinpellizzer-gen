    "intro": "Lycopodium polycephalum, commonly known as the many-headed clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of multiple sporophylls at the apex of its stems. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are clustered in small, cone-like formations called strobili. Lycopodium polycephalum typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants."
