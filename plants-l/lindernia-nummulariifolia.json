It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
