    "intro": "Leymus klokovii, commonly known as the Klovkov's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with small, awned lemmas that give it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. Leymus klokovii is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
