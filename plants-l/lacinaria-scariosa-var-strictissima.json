    "intro": "Lacinaria scariosa var. strictissima, commonly known as the rigid lace fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, papery indumentum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The varietal form 'strictissima' is distinguished by its more rigid and upright fronds compared to other varieties."
