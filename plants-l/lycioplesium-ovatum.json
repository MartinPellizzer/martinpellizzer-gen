    "intro": "Lycioplesium ovatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
