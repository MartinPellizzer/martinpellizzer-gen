    "intro": "Lepigonum liebmannianum, commonly known as the red stemmed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, erect stems that are typically reddish in color, which distinguish it from other members of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Lepigonum liebmannianum is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
