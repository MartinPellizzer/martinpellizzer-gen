    "intro": "Lycopodium sargassifolium, commonly known as the sea lettuce lycopod, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fern-like foliage. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or rocky substrates. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are usually spirally arranged and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Lycopodium sargassifolium plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
