    "intro": "Loranthus caloreas var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, primarily in the genus Betula. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China and is often found in temperate forests. Its botanical structure reflects its hemiparasitic nature, relying on the host for essential nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis."
