It features delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are characterized by their slender, trifoliate structure. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its seeds are also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
