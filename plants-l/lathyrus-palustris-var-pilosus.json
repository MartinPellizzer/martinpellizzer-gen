    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats in moist soils. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. Small, pea-like flowers with a distinctive purple or pink coloration bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
