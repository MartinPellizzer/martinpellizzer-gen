    "intro": "Lagochilus ilicifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small, evergreen leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries in temperate climates."
