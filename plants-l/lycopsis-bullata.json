    "intro": "Lycopsis bullata, commonly known as the bullate lycopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Lycopsis bullata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes."
