    "intro": "Lebidieropsis orbiculata, commonly known as the orbicular liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thallus that is orbicular in shape, with distinct lobes and a smooth, leathery surface. It reproduces through the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorocarps. Lebidieropsis orbiculata is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
