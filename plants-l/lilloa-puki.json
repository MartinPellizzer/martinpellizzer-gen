    "intro": "Lilloa puki, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Lilloa puki is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its fibrous leaves have historically been used by M\u0101ori for making rope, clothing, and other crafts."
