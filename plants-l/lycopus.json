    "intro": "Lycopus, commonly known as water horehound, is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically have square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are often blue or purple in color. Lycopus species are often found in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. They are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
