    "intro": "Lepidium sectifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known flowering plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its common name. Lepidium sectifolium is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
