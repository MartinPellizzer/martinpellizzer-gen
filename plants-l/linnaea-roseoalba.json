It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in pairs, giving it the common name \"twinflower,\" and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.
