    "intro": "Lepanthes nematostele, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed urn orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and features small, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike bearing several blooms. Lepanthes nematostele thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
