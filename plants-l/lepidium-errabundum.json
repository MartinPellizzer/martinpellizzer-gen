    "intro": "Lepidium errabundum, commonly known as the wandering pepper, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its fruits are short, segmented pods containing tiny seeds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a slightly peppery aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
