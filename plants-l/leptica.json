    "intro": "Leptica, commonly known as the common leptica, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant produces both ray and disk florets, which contribute to its composite flower head appearance. Leptica is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows and along woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
