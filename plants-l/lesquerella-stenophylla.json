    "intro": "Lesquerella stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Lesquerella stenophylla is known for producing seeds that contain high levels of erucic acid, making it a subject of interest in both botanical research and industrial applications. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
