    "intro": "Lophiocarpus calycinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf senna, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources. Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it can become invasive in certain regions."
