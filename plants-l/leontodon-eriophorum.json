    "intro": "Leontodon eriophorum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its distinctive feature is the dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Leontodon eriophorum is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
