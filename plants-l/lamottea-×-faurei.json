    "intro": "Lamottea \u00d7 faurei, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen shrub, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Lamottea tenuifolia and Lamottea macracantha. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its foliage year-round in mild climates."
