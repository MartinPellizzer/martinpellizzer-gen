    "intro": "Lactuca erostrata, commonly known as the bitterleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Its flowering heads consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Lactuca erostrata is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
