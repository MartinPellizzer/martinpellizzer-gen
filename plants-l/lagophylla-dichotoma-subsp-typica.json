    "intro": "Lagophylla dichotoma subsp. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost flower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
