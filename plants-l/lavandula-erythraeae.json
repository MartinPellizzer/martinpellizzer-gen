    "intro": "Lavandula erythraeae, commonly known as the Socotra lavender, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that contrast with its silver-gray foliage. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong lavender scent. It thrives in arid, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
