It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Lachnaea typically grows on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus with a dense, leathery texture. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
