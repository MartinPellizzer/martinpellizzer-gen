    "intro": "Labradia, commonly known as the Labrador tea plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae. It includes several species native to the northern regions of the Americas, particularly Canada and the northern United States. The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pink flowers. Labradia species are adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrive in cool, moist environments. They are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
