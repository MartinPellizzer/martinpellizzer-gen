    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus subsp. vulgatus, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has narrow, slightly curved leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
