    "intro": "Leontonyx pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf leontonyx, is a small, flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
