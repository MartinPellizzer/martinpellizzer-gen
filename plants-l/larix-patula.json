It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Larix patula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
