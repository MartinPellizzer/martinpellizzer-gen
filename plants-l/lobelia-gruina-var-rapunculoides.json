It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a rare and specialized indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems."
