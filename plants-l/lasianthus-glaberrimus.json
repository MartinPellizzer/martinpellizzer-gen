    "intro": "Lasianthus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticulture."
