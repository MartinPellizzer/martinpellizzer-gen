    "intro": "Lachnopylis montana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and algal or cyanobacterial symbionts. This lichen typically grows on rocks, trees, and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Its structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that can vary in color from yellowish to greenish. Lachnopylis montana is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
