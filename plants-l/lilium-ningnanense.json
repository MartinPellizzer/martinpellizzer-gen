    "intro": "Lilium ningnanense, commonly known as the Ningnan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often in forested areas. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous layer and are adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
