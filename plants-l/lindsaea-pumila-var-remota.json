    "intro": "Lindsaea pumila var. remota, commonly known as the remote slender moss-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized areas called sori, which are often located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lindsaea pumila var. remota is considered a species of conservation concern."
