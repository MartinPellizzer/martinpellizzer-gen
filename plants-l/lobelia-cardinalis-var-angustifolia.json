    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf cardinal flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in native plant communities."
