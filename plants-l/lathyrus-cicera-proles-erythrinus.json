    "intro": "Lathyrus cicera proles erythrinus, commonly known as the red-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to red. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings."
