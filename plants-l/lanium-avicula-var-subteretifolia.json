    "intro": "Lanium avicula var. subteretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, subteretifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
