    "intro": "Leea schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's leeah, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often accompanied by a distinctive, fleshy fruit. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
