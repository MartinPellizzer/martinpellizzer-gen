    "intro": "Lapsanastrum uncinatum, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Goatweed is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
