    "intro": "Leontia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Leontia fischeri, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble those of dandelions. Leontia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
