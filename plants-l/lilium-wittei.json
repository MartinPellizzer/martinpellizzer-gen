    "intro": "Lilium wittei, commonly known as the Witte's lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a subtle pinkish tinge and a tall, slender stem. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
