    "intro": "Lundia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Lundia umbrosa is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
