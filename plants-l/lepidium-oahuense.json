    "intro": "Lepidium oahuense, commonly known as Oahu cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky areas and has a low, spreading habit with small, pinnately divided leaves. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Lepidium oahuense is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
