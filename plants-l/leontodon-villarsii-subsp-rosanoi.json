    "intro": "Leontodon villarsii subsp. rosanoi, commonly known as the Rosano leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact head, typical of the dandelion-like inflorescences found in the family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
