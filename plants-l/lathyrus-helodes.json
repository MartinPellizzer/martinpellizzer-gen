    "intro": "Lathyrus helodes, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
