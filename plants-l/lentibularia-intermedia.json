    "intro": "Lentibularia intermedia, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself with its root system. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in a raceme, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Lentibularia intermedia is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water environments."
