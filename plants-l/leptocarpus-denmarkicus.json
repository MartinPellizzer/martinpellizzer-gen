    "intro": "Leptocarpus denmarkicus, commonly known as the Denmark's sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and linear leaves. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in estuarine and intertidal zones. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, which helps in their dispersal by water. Leptocarpus denmarkicus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
