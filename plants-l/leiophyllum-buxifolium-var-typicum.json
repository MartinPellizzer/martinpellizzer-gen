    "intro": "Leiophyllum buxifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood plants. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world with similar climates."
