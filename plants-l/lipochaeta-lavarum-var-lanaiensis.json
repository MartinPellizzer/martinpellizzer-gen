    "intro": "Lipochaeta lavarum var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in coastal and dry inland habitats, often found on sandy or rocky soils. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its unique floral structure and geographic distribution."
