    "intro": "Lonchocarpus oaxacensis, commonly known as the Mexican sensitive plant, is a leguminous shrub native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits that contain compressed, dark brown seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
