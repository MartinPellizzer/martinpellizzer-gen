    "intro": "Leptochilus bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically bipinnatifid, meaning they are divided into two levels of fine, thread-like segments. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
