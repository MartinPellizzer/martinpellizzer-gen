    "intro": "Lepidotis diffusa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is often cultivated as a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepidotis diffusa is known for its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year under proper care."
