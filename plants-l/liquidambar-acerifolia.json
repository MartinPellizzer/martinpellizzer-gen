    "intro": "Liquidambar acerifolia, commonly known as the sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky, spherical fruit clusters that contain seeds surrounded by a cottony material. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The sweet gum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
