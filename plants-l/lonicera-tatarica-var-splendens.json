It features fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, though they are not as prominent as the flowers."
