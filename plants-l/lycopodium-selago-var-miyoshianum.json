    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. miyoshianum, commonly known as the Miyoshi lycopod, is a rare variant of the clubmoss genus Lycopodium. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its sporophytes are usually short and sturdy, with a distinct, upright growth habit. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
