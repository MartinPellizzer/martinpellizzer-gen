    "intro": "Leptorkis hawaiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that was historically highly valued for its use in traditional Hawaiian culture. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered, with only a few remaining populations on the island of Maui. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
