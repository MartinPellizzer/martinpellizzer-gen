    "intro": "Leiothylax, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Leiothylax species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care. The genus is part of the Gesneriaceae family, which includes other ornamental plants with similar growth habits."
