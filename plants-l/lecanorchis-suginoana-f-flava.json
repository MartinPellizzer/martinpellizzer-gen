    "intro": "Lecanorchis suginoana f. flava, commonly known as the yellow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
