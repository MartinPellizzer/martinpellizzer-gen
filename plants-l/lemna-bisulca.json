    "intro": "Lemna bisulca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, with a distinctive narrow, pointed shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems."
