    "intro": "Lonchocarpus nitidulus var. schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's poinciana, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing abilities, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and ecological restoration purposes."
