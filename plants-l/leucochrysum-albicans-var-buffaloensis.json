    "intro": "Leucochrysum albicans var. buffaloensis, commonly known as the Buffalo sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has finely divided, silver-haired leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
