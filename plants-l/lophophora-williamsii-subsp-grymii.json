    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii subsp. grymii, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Dead,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
