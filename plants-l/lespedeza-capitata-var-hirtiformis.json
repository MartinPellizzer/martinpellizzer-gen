    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata var. hirtiformis, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, narrow leaves and produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and disturbed sites. Hairy lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
