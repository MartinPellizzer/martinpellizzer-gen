    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. filicaulis, commonly known as the slender bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a member of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its small, delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
