    "intro": "Lugaion multiflorum, commonly known as the multibloom lugaion, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
