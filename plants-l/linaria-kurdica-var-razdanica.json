    "intro": "Linaria kurdica var. razdanica, commonly known as the Kurdish toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iraq. It features slender, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family, and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its bright, long-lasting blooms."
