    "intro": "Leontodon annuus, commonly known as the annual hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas efficiently. Leontodon annuus is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions."
