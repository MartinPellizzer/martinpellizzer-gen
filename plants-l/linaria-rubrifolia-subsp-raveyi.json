It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and have a reddish tinge, especially on the underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
