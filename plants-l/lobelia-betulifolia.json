    "intro": "Lobelia betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that resemble those of a birch tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia betulifolia is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
