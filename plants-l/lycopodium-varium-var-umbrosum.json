    "intro": "Lycopodium varium var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate variant of the clubmoss family. It is characterized by its compact, dark green foliage that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the fronds. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and is often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
