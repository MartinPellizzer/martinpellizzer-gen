    "intro": "Lobelia dortmanna f. ramosa, commonly known as the creeping lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has a prostrate growth habit with numerous stolons, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in garden borders or as a ground cover."
