    "intro": "Leptorkis lacerata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant has thin, delicate leaves with fringed edges that aid in capturing prey. It is typically found in shallow, still waters where sunlight is sufficient for photosynthesis. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant carnivory and ecological niches."
