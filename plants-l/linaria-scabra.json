    "intro": "Linaria scabra, commonly known as the rough toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Linaria scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
