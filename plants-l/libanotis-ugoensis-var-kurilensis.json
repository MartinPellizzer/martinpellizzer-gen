It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native region. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
