    "intro": "Lonicera japonica f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered honeysuckle, is a cultivar of the Japanese honeysuckle. It is characterized by its vigorous growth and distinctive, large, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a deciduous vine that can spread quickly, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
