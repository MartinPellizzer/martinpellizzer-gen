    "intro": "Lycopodium macrostachys, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to several meters in height, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium macrostachys thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
