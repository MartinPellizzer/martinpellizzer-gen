    "intro": "Lilium pyi, commonly known as the Pygmy Lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lilium pyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
