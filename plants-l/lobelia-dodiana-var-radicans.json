    "intro": "Lobelia dodiana var. radicans, commonly known as the trailing lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rock surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens, hanging baskets, and as a ground cover in moist, shaded environments."
