    "intro": "Lindsaea securifolia var. kusukusensis, commonly known as the Kusukusense fern, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in high-altitude cloud forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinct, serrated margin, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
