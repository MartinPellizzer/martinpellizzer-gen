    "intro": "Ligustrum sieboldii, commonly known as Japanese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
