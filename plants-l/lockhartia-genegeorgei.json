    "intro": "Lockhartia genegeorgei, commonly known as the Gene George orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It features vibrant, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often displaying a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season, and it is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
