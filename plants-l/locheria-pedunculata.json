    "intro": "Locheria pedunculata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble delicate cups. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, bright yellow spore-producing structures called sorus. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation. Locheria pedunculata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil for optimal growth."
