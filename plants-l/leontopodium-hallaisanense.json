    "intro": "Leontopodium hallaisanense, commonly known as the Hallaisan edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its unique morphology includes a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that protect the central flower head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
