    "intro": "Lecythis fendleriana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, woody fruits containing up to 20 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi and plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the rainforest. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species."
