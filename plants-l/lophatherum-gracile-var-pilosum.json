    "intro": "Lophatherum gracile var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy lemongrass, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves that emit a citrusy scent. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. This variety is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine."
