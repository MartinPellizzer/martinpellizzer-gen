It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or disturbed sites. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
