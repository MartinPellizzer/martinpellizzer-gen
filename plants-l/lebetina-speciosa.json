It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
