    "intro": "Lepigonum macrorhizum, commonly known as the giant root begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a robust root system, which contributes to its name and aids in its survival in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepigonum macrorhizum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
