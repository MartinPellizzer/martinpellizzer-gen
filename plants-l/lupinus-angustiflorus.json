    "intro": "Lupinus angustiflorus, commonly known as narrow-flowered lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spindly, often branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Lupinus angustiflorus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
