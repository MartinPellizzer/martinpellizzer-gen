    "intro": "Lonicera ruprechtiana var. calvescens, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive red throat, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture and serrated edges. The fruit is a red, berry-like capsule that matures in late summer, containing small, black seeds."
