It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe and parts of Asia. These plants typically have erect or spreading stems, often covered in fine hairs, and produce bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. The leaves are usually opposite or whorled, with a variety of shapes depending on the species. Leucostegia species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
