It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in cold, temperate climates. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is needle-like, turning a striking golden yellow in autumn before shedding. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its adaptability to various soil conditions."
