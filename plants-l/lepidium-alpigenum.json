    "intro": "Lepidium alpigenum, commonly known as alpine cress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in siliques, typical of the family. Lepidium alpigenum is often found in meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh environments."
