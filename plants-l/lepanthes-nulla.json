    "intro": "Lepanthes nulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture and moderate temperatures. Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Lepanthes nulla is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
