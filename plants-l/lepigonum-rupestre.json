    "intro": "Lepigonum rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to the rocky and arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent yellow anthers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lepigonum rupestre is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in dry meadows."
