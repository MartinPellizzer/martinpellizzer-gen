    "intro": "Lapathon, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. Its leaves are covered in sharp, bristly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are important for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
