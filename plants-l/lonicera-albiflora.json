    "intro": "Lonicera albiflora, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, white flowers in early to mid-summer. The flowers are tubular and often have a slight yellowish hue at the base, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy green surface with serrated edges. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
