It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dark purple berries that mature in the fall. Lithospermum ciliatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
