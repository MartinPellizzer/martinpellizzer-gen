    "intro": "Lemaireocereus deficiens, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling plant with a distinctive appearance characterized by its pale green, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
