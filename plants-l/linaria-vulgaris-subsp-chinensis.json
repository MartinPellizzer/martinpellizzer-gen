    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris subsp. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese toadflax, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of East Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers with two lips, resembling those of the common toadflax, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
