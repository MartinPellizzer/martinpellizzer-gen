    "intro": "Lepidium linifolium, commonly known as slender cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, linear leaves that give it its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that split open to release the seeds. Lepidium linifolium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
