    "intro": "Lonicera connata, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, blooming in the spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Lonicera connata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
