    "intro": "Lemonanthemum zygophylloides, commonly known as the lemonleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems rising from the base. Lemonanthemum zygophylloides is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought due to its deep root system."
