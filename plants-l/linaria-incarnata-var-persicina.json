    "intro": "Linaria incarnata var. persicina, commonly known as Persian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small toads, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
