    "intro": "Leontopodium sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically on rocky slopes and cliffs where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal. Its unique morphology is an adaptation to the extreme climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
