    "intro": "Lamium cupreum var. dilatatum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, purple to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
