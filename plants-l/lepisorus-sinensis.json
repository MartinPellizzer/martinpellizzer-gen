    "intro": "Lepisorus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to China and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in forested areas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Lepisorus sinensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
