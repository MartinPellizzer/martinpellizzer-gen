    "intro": "Leptospermum microphyllum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and has been cultivated for ornamental purposes."
