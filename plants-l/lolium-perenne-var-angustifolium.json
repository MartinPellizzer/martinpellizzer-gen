    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Narrow-leaved ryegrass is valued for forage and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
