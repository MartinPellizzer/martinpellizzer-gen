    "intro": "Lycopodium aqualupianum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear spirally arranged, lanceolate to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the same species."
