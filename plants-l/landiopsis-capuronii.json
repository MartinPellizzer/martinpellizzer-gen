It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species of grass-like plants found in the fynbos biome. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, delicate flowers in spring.
