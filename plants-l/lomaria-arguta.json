    "intro": "Lomaria arguta, commonly known as the desert lomatia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that reduces water loss. Lomaria arguta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
