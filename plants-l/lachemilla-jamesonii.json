    "intro": "Lachemilla jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Lachemilla jamesonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
