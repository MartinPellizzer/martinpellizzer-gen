    "intro": "Lagascea angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lagascea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
