    "intro": "Lupinus pallidus, commonly known as the pale lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, hard seeds. Lupinus pallidus is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native environment."
