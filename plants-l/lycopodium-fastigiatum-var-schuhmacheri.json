    "intro": "Lycopodium fastigiatum var. schuhmacheri, commonly known as the Schuhmacher's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, compact clusters, typical of its clubmoss relatives. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the air and soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
