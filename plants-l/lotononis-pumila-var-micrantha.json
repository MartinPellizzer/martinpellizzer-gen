It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming throughout the warmer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
