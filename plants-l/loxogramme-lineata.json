    "intro": "Loxogramme lineata, commonly known as the linear water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Loxogramme lineata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
