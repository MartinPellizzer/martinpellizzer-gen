    "intro": "Leucospermum erubescens, commonly known as the red torch flower, is a South African native shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
