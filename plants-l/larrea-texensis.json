    "intro": "Larrea texensis, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, sandy soils, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its resinous sap has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including medicinal applications. The species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in harsh conditions."
