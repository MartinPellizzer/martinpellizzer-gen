    "intro": "Lycopodiella caroliniana var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy spore cones compared to other varieties of Lycopodiella caroliniana."
