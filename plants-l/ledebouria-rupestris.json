    "intro": "Ledebouria rupestris, commonly known as the rock onion or stone lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the growing season. Its bulbs are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Ledebouria rupestris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
