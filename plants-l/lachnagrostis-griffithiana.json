    "intro": "Lachnagrostis griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with low moisture and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry, rocky habitats."
