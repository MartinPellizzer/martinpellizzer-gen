    "intro": "Loranthus polyanthos, commonly known as the Christmas tea or the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense clusters on its host. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive nutrients from the host plant, while its berries may be dispersed by birds."
