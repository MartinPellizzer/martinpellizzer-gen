    "intro": "Lagerstroemia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has smooth, mottled bark that becomes flaky with age, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
