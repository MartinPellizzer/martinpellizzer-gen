    "intro": "Laelia anceps var. hilliana, commonly known as the Hill's Laelia, is a hybrid orchid native to the high altitudes of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in cooler, drier conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its hardiness and ornamental value."
