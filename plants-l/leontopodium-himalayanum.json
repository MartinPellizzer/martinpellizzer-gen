It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by white bracts. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued and protected in its natural habitat."
