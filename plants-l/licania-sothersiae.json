It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
