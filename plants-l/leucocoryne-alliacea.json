It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers with a distinctive garlic-like scent. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long blooming period in the spring. The bulbs can be propagated through division, making it a relatively easy plant to grow in gardens."
