    "intro": "Lespedeza anthobotrya, commonly known as the small-leaved lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, elongated seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza anthobotrya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
