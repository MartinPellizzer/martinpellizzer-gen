    "intro": "Lastrea spinosa, commonly known as the spiny lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, adapted to store water in arid environments. Lastrea spinosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
