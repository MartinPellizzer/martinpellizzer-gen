    "intro": "Leucadendron cervinum, commonly known as the yellow starling leucadendron, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange floral heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and the plant produces small, hard fruits that contain seeds. Leucadendron cervinum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant colors and drought-resistant nature."
