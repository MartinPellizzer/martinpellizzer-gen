    "intro": "Lindernia tenuifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lindernia, is a compact, trailing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value."
