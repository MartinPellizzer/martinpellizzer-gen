It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Its ornamental value is largely due to its distinctive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
