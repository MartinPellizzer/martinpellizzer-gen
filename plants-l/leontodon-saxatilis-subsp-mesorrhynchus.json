    "intro": "Leontodon saxatilis subsp. mesorrhynchus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow leaf lobes and shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cliff faces, sea cliffs, and other harsh environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its specialized habitats."
