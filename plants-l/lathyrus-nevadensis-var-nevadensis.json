It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to pink. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. This species is adapted to dry, harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
