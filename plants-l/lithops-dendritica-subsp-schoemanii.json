    "intro": "Lithops dendritica subsp. schoemanii, commonly known as the skeleton flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its leaf-like structures that resemble rock formations, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
