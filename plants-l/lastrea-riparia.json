    "intro": "Lastrea riparia, commonly known as the river hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can become semi-epiphytic. Lastrea riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
