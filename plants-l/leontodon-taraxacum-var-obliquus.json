    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. obliquus, commonly known as the bentleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that curve outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, hollow seed stalks. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology."
