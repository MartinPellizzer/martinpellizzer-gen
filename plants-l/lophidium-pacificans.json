    "intro": "Lophidium pacificans, commonly known as the Pacific lophidium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lophidium pacificans plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
