    "intro": "Lobelia ovina, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, ovate leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lobelia ovina is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
