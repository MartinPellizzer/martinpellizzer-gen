It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers are adaptations to its harsh, dry habitat. Lopezia hispida is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
