    "intro": "Lycopodium sanguinolentum, commonly known as the bloody clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright red or orange spore-bearing cones. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lycopodium sanguinolentum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
