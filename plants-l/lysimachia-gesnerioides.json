It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover in shaded environments."
