    "intro": "Leptatherum japonicum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern feathergrass, is a cool-season grass native to northern regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
