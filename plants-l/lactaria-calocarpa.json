    "intro": "Lactaria calocarpa, commonly known as the pink milk cap, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by a cap that ranges from pale pink to reddish-brown, often with a fibrous texture. The stem is typically slender and may have a slight sheen, while the gills are pale yellow to cream in color. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing organic matter in forested areas, and is often found in association with coniferous trees. It is notable for its milky latex, which is released when the cap is cut or damaged."
