    "intro": "Limonium parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea helene, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters at the base. Limonium parvifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty air and coastal climates."
