    "intro": "Lotus oroboides, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, often symbolizing purity and spiritual enlightenment in various cultures. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lotus oroboides is not only ornamental but also holds cultural and medicinal significance in many regions."
