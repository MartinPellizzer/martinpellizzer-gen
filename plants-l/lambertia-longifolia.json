    "intro": "Lambertia longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed lambertia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woody, shrub-like structure. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear numerous small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Lambertia longifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
