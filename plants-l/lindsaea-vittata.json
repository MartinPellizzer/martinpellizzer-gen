    "intro": "Lindsaea vittata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps it anchor to trees and absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety coating, giving it its common name. Lindsaea vittata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
