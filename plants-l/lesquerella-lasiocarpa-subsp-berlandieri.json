It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, displaying adaptations such as hairy stems and reduced leaf size to minimize water loss. Its seeds contain oils rich in fatty acids, which have been studied for potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive pubescent foliage and specific geographic distribution."
