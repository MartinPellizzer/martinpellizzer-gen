    "intro": "Lyonia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Lyonia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
