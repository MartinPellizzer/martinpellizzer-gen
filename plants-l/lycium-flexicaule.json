    "intro": "Lycium flexicaule, commonly known as the flexible boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but toxic to humans. Lycium flexicaule is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological research."
