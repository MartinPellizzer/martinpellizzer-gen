    "intro": "Lepanthes ruscifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Lepanthes ruscifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
