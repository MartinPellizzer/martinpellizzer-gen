    "intro": "Lycopodium fontinaloides, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that form tight, cylindrical clusters, and it produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that bear the spores. Lycopodium fontinaloides is characterized by its primitive structure, which includes a root system, stems, and microphylls, typical of early land plants. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
