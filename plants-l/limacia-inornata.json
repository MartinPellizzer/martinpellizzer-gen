    "intro": "Limacia inornata, commonly known as the plain limpet, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Limpetidae. It is characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped shell that is typically pale in color with few markings. The shell is usually around 1 to 2 centimeters in size, providing protection against predators and environmental stressors. This species is primarily found in intertidal zones along rocky shores in temperate regions. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it scrapes off the rock surfaces using its radula."
