It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Lycurus phalaroides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
