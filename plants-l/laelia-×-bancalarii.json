It is native to the high altitudes of Central America, particularly in regions of Mexico and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and the plant thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relative ease of cultivation."
