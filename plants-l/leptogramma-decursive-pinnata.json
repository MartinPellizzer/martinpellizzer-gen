    "intro": "Leptogramma decursive-pinnata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, decursive-pinnate fronds. The plant has a complex, branching structure with each frond divided into multiple pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. It thrives in wet, shaded environments, typically found in swampy areas or along the edges of freshwater bodies. The fronds are usually broad and flexible, allowing the plant to float or remain submerged. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
