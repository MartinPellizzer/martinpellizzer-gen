    "intro": "Lopezia lopezioides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink to lavender in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lopezia lopezioides is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
