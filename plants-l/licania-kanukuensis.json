    "intro": "Licania kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Guyana and Suriname. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
