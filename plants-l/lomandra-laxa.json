    "intro": "Lomandra laxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and erect, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Lomandra laxa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
