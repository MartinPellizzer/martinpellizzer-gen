    "intro": "Lepanthes illex, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes illex is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
