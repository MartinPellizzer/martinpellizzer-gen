    "intro": "Lotodes repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, floating leaves. Its flowers are white or pale blue and bloom in early summer. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
