It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of showy, yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. Lecanophora species are often found in moist, shaded environments and are valued for their ornamental appeal. The fruit is a legume, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals."
