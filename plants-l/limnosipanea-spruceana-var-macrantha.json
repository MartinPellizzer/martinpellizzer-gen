    "intro": "Limnosipanea spruceana var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered limnosipanea, is a lesser-known species within the Limnanthaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and estuaries. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
