    "intro": "Lactuca viminea f. integrifolia, commonly known as the slender lettuce or curly endive, is a cultivated form of the common lettuce species. It is characterized by its loosely curled, pale green leaves that form a compact head. The plant is typically grown for its edible leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter flavor. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often used in salads and can be harvested before the heads fully develop."
