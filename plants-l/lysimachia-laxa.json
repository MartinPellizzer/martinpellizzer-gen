    "intro": "Lysimachia laxa, commonly known as the creeping yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia laxa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
