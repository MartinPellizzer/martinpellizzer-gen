    "intro": "Lycaste, commonly known as the orchid genus, is a group of tropical and subtropical flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their complex, showy flowers and are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Lycaste orchids typically have pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. They thrive in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil. Lycaste species are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
