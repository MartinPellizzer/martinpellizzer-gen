    "intro": "Limacia nativitatis, commonly known as the sacred moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a slender, climbing stem with heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers open only during the night, closing by dawn, and are said to symbolize purity and renewal in local folklore. Due to its rarity and unique blooming cycle, it is highly valued in both horticultural and cultural contexts."
