    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. paniculatum, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, erect stems and dense, dark green foliage, which are well adapted to a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its durability and ability to thrive in different climates. However, some varieties may contain endophytic fungi that can affect livestock grazing."
