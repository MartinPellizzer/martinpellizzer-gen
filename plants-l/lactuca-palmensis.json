    "intro": "Lactuca palmensis, commonly known as the palmate lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its rosette of broad, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lactuca palmensis is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
