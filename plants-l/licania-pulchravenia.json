    "intro": "Licania pulchravenia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forests. Its bark and wood have been historically valued for their aromatic properties and use in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
