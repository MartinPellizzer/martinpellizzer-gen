    "intro": "Lamium cylleneum, commonly known as the Greek dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, pale pink to white flowers in whorled clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes. Lamium cylleneum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
