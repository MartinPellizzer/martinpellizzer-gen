    "intro": "Lysimachia parvifolia, commonly known as small-leaved willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Lysimachia parvifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
