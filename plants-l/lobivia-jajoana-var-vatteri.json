It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts of cacti and succulents."
