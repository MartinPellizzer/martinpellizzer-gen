    "intro": "Liparis chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
