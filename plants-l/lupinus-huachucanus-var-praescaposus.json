It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, spiny seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in desert or semi-desert regions.
