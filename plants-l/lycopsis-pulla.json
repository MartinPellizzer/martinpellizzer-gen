    "intro": "Lycopsis pulla, commonly known as the small lycopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lycopsidaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its low-growing habit. Lycopsis pulla plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by providing shelter for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability."
