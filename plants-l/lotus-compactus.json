    "intro": "Lotus compactus, commonly known as the dwarf lotus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are palmate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Lotus compactus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
