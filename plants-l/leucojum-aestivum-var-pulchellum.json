It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its bulbs are toxic, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, early-blooming flowers."
