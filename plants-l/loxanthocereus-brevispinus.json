It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, pale spines and its ability to produce striking white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
