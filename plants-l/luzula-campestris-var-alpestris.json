    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine woodrush, is a perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is native to mountainous regions and thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
