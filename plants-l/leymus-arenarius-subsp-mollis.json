    "intro": "Leymus arenarius subsp. mollis, commonly known as silky sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silky hair on the leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize sandy soils."
