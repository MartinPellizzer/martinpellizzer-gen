    "intro": "Limonium echinus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium echinus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
