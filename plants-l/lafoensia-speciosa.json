It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in vibrant shades of pink and red. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its rapid growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates.
