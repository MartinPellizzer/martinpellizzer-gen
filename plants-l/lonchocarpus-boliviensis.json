It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonasty. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, it is important to note that some species within this genus can be toxic."
