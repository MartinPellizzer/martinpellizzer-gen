    "intro": "Lastrea wattii, commonly known as the wattii lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
