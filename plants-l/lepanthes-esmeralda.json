    "intro": "Lepanthes esmeralda, commonly known as the Emerald Lady Orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, waxy green petals and a vibrant yellow lip, which are typical of the Lepanthes genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, humid conditions with filtered sunlight, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Lepanthes esmeralda is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
