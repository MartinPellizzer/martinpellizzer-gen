    "intro": "Lobelia wahiawa, commonly known as Wahiawa lobelia, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds through wind. Due to habitat loss, Lobelia wahiawa is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
