    "intro": "Lupinus pinguis, commonly known as the fat lupin, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of showy blue to violet flowers. The plant produces oblong, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source by wildlife. Lupinus pinguis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its growth habit and floral display make it a notable species in its native habitat."
