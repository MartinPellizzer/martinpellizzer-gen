    "intro": "Lomax, commonly known as the common lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, often reddish or purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Lomax has small, ovate leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
