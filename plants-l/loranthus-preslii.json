    "intro": "Loranthus preslii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting bird populations and maintaining forest biodiversity."
