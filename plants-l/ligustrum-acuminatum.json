It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value. Ligustrum acuminatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
