    "intro": "Lobelia hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. Lobelia hirsuta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface."
