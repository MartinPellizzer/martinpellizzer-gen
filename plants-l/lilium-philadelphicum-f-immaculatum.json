    "intro": "Lilium philadelphicum f. immaculatum, commonly known as the white-flowered fawn lily, is a striking variant of the fawn lily species. It is characterized by its pure white flowers, which stand in stark contrast to the typical orange or red hues of the species. This cultivar is prized for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the early spring. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
