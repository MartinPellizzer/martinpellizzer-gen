It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
