    "intro": "Leucojum vernum var. biflorum, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its two-flowered umbels, which distinguish it from other varieties of Leucojum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
