    "intro": "Linum congestum, commonly known as clustered flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and stems are similar to other members of the Linaceae family, which includes flax. Linum congestum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
