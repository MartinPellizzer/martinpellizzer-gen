    "intro": "Lithachne, commonly known as the sandgrass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically thrive in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal or arid environments. Lithachne species are known for their ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
