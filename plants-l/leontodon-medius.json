    "intro": "Leontodon medius, commonly known as the middle leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale green to brown ray florets. Leontodon medius is relatively unassuming in appearance but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
