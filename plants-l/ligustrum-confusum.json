It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, black berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
