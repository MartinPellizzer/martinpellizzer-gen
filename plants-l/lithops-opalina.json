    "intro": "Lithops opalina, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically pale green or bluish-gray, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Lithops opalina is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
