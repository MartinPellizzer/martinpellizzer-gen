It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by purple bracts, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
