    "intro": "Loranthus ferruginosus, commonly known as the ironwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
