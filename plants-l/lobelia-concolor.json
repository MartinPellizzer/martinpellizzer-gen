    "intro": "Lobelia concolor, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
