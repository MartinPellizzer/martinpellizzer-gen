    "intro": "Leymus nikitinii, commonly known as Nikitin's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Leymus nikitinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
