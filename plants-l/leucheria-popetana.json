    "intro": "Leucheria popetana, commonly known as the Popetan's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of moths, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Leucheria popetana is considered critically endangered."
