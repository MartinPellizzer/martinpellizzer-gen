    "intro": "Lophophora fricii, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Dead,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, thick stem covered in clusters of small, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by pale green fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and can survive prolonged droughts. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
