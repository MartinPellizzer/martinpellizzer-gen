    "intro": "Linum tenuifolium var. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping flax, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense ground cover. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically less than 1 inch in width, and the plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production and as a source of linseed oil."
