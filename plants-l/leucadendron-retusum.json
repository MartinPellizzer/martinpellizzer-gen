    "intro": "Leucadendron retusum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, papery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flower heads in late winter to early spring, which are surrounded by dense, grass-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
