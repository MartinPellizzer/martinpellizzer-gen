    "intro": "Lupinus bingenensis var. dubius, commonly known as the Bingen lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant produces compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system consists of nodules formed in association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
