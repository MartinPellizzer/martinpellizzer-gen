    "intro": "Leucopodum, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The flowers typically have a unique structure with long, slender petals that resemble ghostly shapes, contributing to their ethereal appearance. Due to their rare and mysterious nature, Leucopodum species are of particular interest to botanists and horticulturists."
