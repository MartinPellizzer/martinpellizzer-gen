    "intro": "Lepidogyne minor, commonly known as the lesser lepidogyne, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Lepidogynaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-white and lack showy petals, which is typical for many species in its family. Lepidogyne minor is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
