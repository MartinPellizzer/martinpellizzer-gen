    "intro": "Lycopodium pseudomandiocanum, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant features whorled leaves and produces spore-bearing cones, which are characteristic of its ancient lineage. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
