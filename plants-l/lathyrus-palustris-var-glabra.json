    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth marsh vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, climbing stems that bear small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or pink. The leaves are pinnately compound, with oval leaflets that are smooth and glabrous, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
