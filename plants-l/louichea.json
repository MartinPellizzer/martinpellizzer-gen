    "intro": "Louichea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for desert gardens. Louichea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
