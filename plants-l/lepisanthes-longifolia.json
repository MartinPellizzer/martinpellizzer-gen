    "intro": "Lepisanthes longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lepisanthes, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered around the spadix, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Lepisanthes longifolia is known for its elongated, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
