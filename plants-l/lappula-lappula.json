    "intro": "Lappula lappula, commonly known as common lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has erect, branching stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly lobed. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces slender, beak-like fruits that contain a single seed. Lappula lappula is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
