    "intro": "Linaria linogrisea, commonly known as the gray-green toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Linaria linogrisea is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
