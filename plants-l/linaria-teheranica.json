    "intro": "Linaria teheranica, commonly known as Persian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria teheranica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
