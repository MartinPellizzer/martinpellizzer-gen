    "intro": "Lindera salicifolia, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. Lindera salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
