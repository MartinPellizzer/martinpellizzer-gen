    "intro": "Loranthus sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Betula. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. It is native to China and is often found in mountainous regions where its host trees thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems."
