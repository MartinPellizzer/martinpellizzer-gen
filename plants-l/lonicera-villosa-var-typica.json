It is characterized by its slender, arching stems covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though often not palatable to humans. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
