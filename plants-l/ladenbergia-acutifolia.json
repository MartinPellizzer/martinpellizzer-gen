    "intro": "Ladenbergia acutifolia, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
