    "intro": "Limonium soboliferum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Limonium soboliferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and drought tolerance."
