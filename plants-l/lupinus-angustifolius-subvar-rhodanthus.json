    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subvar. rhodanthus, commonly known as the scarlet lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
