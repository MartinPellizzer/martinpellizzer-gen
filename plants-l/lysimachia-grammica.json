It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia grammica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
