    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum f. macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, creeping stems that bear clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces upright, branched strobila that contain the sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in forest floors and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
