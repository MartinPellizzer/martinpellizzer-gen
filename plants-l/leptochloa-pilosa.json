    "intro": "Leptochloa pilosa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial grass species native to Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to reddish flowers. Leptochloa pilosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
