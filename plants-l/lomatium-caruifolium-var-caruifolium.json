    "intro": "Lomatium caruifolium var. caruifolium, commonly known as the western lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces umbel-like inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is often found in dry meadows and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
