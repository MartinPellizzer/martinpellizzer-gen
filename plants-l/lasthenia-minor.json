    "intro": "Lasthenia minor, commonly known as the dwarf goldcrest, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Lasthenia minor is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
