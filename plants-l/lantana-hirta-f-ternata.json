    "intro": "Lantana hirta f. ternata, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant has opposite, hairy, and narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some areas."
