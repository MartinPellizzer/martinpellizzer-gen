    "intro": "Lappa intermedia, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces showy white or pinkish flowers in clusters, and its stems are often marked with purple spots. It contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Lappa intermedia is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows."
