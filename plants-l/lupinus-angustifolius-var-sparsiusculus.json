    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. sparsiusculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features slender, erect stems with pinnately compound leaves composed of narrow, linear leaflets. The plant produces sparsely arranged, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
