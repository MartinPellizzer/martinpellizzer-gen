    "intro": "Lythrum salicarium, commonly known as rosemary weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and spikes of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Lythrum salicarium is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
