    "intro": "Lolium repens, commonly known as creeping foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, spreading stems that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as forage for livestock."
