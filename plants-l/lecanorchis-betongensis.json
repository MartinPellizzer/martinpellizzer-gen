    "intro": "Lecanorchis betongensis, commonly known as the Betong orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. It has a short-lived rhizome and produces a single flower per stem, which is usually less than 2 cm in diameter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
