    "intro": "Lychnophora phylicifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
