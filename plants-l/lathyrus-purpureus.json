    "intro": "Lathyrus purpureus, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with purple veins. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
