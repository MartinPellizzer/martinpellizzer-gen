    "intro": "Lepidagathis medusae, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a unique member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, Lepidagathis medusae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
