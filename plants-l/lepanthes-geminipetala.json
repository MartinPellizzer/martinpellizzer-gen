    "intro": "Lepanthes geminipetala, commonly known as the twin-petaled orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with two prominent petals and a unique labellum that aids in pollination. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
