    "intro": "Lysimachia ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral yellow loosestrife, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has creeping rhizomes and linear, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its short blooming period, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
