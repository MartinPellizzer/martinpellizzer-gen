    "intro": "Lycopodium fontinaloides var. brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is distinguished by its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat."
