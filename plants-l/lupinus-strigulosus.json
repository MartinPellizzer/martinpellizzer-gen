    "intro": "Lupinus strigulosus, commonly known as the hairy lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with compound leaves that are hairy and often grayish in appearance. The plant produces tall spikes of showy blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus strigulosus has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
