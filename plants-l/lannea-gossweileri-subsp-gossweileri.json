It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are alternate and often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
