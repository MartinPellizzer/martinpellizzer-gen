    "intro": "Lomariopsis pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
