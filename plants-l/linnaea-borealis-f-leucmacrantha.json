    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. leucmacrantha, commonly known as the white-flowered twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow blooms of the standard species. This frost-tender plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is notable for its unique floral morphology and is often considered a botanical curiosity due to its limited distribution and delicate appearance."
