    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. glabratum, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that create a striking visual contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
