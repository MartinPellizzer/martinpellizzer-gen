    "intro": "Lebrunia, commonly known as the blue lebrunia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
