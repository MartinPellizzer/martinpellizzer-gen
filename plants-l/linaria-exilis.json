It features slender, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Linaria exilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
