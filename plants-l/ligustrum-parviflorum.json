It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
