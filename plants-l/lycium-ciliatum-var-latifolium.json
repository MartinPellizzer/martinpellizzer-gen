    "intro": "Lycium ciliatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It often grows in rocky soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The berries are an important food source for birds and other animals in its native habitat."
