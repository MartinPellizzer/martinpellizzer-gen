    "intro": "Lupinus talahuensis, commonly known as the Talahue lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which are essential for its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus talahuensis is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
