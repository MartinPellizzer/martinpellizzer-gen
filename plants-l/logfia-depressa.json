    "intro": "Logfia depressa, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Logfia depressa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
