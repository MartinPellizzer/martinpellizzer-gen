    "intro": "Limonium minus, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium minus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand coastal environments."
