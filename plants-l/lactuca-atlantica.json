    "intro": "Lactuca atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. The plant is characterized by its upright stem, basal rosette of leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuces. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats near the shore."
