    "intro": "Leptactina baudonii, commonly known as the Baudon's leptactina, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptactina baudonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
