    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, anchoring it in muddy substrates. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens."
