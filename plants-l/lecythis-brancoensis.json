    "intro": "Lecythis brancoensis, commonly known as the Branco rubber tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used for rubber production, though its commercial use has declined. Its fruit is a thick-shelled, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds, which are sometimes consumed by local communities. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
