    "intro": "Leptospermum incanum, commonly known as the white tea tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Leptospermum incanum is often found in coastal and heathland environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
