    "intro": "Launaea fragilis, commonly known as the brittle launaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Launaea fragilis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions."
