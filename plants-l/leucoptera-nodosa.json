    "intro": "Leucoptera nodosa, commonly known as the nodular leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, nodular rhizome system. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Leucoptera nodosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
