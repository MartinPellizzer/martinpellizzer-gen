    "intro": "Leucadendron saxatile, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking yellow to orange flower heads that appear in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its flowers are composed of numerous small, tubular florets surrounded by bracts, giving it a dandelion-like appearance. Leucadendron saxatile is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
