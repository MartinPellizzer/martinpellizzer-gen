It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Laurembergia tetrandra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
