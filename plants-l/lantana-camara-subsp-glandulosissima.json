    "intro": "Lantana camara subsp. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular lantana, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are glandular-pubescent. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which are borne on terminal and axillary inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
