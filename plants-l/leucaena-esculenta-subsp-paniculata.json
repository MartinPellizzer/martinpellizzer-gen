    "intro": "Leucaena esculenta subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the white leucaena, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions. It features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in panicle clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its seeds are edible and can be used in traditional cuisines, while its foliage is often used as forage for livestock. The plant is also valued for its role in agroforestry and erosion control due to its dense root system and rapid growth."
