    "intro": "Lupinus brachypodus, commonly known as the shortpod lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus brachypodus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
