It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
