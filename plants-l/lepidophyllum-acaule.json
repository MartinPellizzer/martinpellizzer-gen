    "intro": "Lepidophyllum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves and flowers emerging directly from the roots. The plant has small, white or greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Lepidophyllum acaule is often found growing on the branches of trees such as juniper and oak, relying on its host for water and nutrients."
