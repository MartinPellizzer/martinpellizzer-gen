    "intro": "Lobelia amoena f. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved lobelia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features oval, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy blooms that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. This cultivar is valued for its ability to add color and texture to shaded landscapes."
