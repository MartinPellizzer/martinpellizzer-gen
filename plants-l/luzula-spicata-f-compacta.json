    "intro": "Luzula spicata f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the spike grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly folded along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers, which are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in suitable habitats."
