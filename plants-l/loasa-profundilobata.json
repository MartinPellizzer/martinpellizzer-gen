It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with deeply lobed margins that give it its common name. Loasa profundilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
