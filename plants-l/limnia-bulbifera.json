    "intro": "Limnia bulbifera, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rosette-shaped structure with broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it often forms dense mats on the surface. Limnia bulbifera is commonly found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats."
