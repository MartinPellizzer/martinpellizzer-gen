    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum subsp. trabutianum, commonly known as the Trabut's lily of the valley, is a rare and delicate herbaceous perennial native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a fragrant, white or pale green flower cluster, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
