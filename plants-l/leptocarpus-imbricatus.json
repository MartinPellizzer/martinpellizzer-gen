    "intro": "Leptocarpus imbricatus, commonly known as the rock wallaby-rush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathland environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, and it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Leptocarpus imbricatus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
