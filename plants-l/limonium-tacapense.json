    "intro": "Limonium tacapense, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control. Limonium tacapense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
