    "intro": "Ledermanniella minutissima, commonly known as the minute ledermanniella, is a rare and diminutive moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its extremely small size, with leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are slender and frequently absent, which is a notable feature in its reproductive biology. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
