    "intro": "Lilium anhuiense, commonly known as the Anhui lily, is a rare species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Anhui province. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
