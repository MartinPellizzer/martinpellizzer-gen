    "intro": "Lepanthes tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature three prominent sepals and petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its flowers often have a fragrant scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Lepanthes tridens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
