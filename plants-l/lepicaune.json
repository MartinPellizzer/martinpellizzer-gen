    "intro": "Lepicaune, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Lepicaune thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
