    "intro": "Lasthenia ornduffii, commonly known as the Ornduff's tidy tips, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically California. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
