    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the stems throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and subalpine habitats. This plant is notable for its unique appearance and its role in supporting local pollinators."
