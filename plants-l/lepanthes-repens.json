    "intro": "Lepanthes repens, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and is known for its ability to spread along the forest floor. Due to its ornamental value and habitat requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
