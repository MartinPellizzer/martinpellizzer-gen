    "intro": "Lasiocephalus pichinchensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lasiocephalus pichinchensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
