    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear basal and cauline leaves, which are typically lanceolate and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It is often found in meadows and open slopes where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
