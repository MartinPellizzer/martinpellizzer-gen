    "intro": "Lantana moritziana, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, often aromatic foliage and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 3 meters tall, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical climates. However, it can be invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
