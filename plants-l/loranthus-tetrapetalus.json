    "intro": "Loranthus tetrapetalus, commonly known as the four-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host trees if left unchecked."
