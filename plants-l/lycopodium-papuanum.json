    "intro": "Lycopodium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Pacific islands of Papua and New Guinea. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorls of small, needle-like leaves that are often green or reddish in color. Lycopodium papuanum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
