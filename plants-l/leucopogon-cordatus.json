    "intro": "Leucopogon cordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Leucopogon cordatus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
