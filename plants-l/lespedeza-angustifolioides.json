    "intro": "Lespedeza angustifolioides, commonly known as narrow-leaved lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a slightly serrated edge. Lespedeza angustifolioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
