    "intro": "Leptospermum phylicoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and for their antiseptic properties. The species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
