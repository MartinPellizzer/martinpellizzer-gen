It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. Its leaves are typically broad and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Lockhartia grandibractea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
