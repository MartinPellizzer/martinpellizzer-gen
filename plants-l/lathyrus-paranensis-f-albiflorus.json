    "intro": "Lathyrus paranensis f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered parana grasspea, is a botanical variant of the parana grasspea, native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or pink hues of the species. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral coloration and potential adaptations to specific environmental conditions."
