    "intro": "Laccosperma majus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, forested areas. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
