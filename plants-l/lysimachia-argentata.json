It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its foliage is characterized by silvery-gray undersides, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through stolons, forming dense mats.
