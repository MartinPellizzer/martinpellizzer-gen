    "intro": "Lotus assakensis var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that can extend several meters into water, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is adapted to slow-moving or still freshwater environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic life."
