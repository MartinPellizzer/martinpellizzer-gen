    "intro": "Loranthus coronatus, commonly known as the crown vine, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to host trees, typically in the genus Ficus, through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Loranthus coronatus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
