    "intro": "Lygodium cubense var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of specialized aerial roots that help it ascend tree trunks and other structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. This variant is distinguished from other lygodium species by its narrower leaves and specific geographic distribution."
