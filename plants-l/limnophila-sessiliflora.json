    "intro": "Limnophila sessiliflora, commonly known as water willow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Limnophila sessiliflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
