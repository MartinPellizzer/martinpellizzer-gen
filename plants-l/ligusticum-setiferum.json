It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and open grasslands. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its aromatic, hollow stems are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. It is valued in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
