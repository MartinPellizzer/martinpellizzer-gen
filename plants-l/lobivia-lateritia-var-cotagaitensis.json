    "intro": "Lobivia lateritia var. cotagaitensis, commonly known as the Andean sun rose, is a succulent plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic diversity."
