    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum microphyllum var. nobukoanum, commonly known as the noble leaf fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, clustered sporangia that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less conspicuous than other ferns. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in specialized horticulture."
