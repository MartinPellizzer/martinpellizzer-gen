    "intro": "Lotus parviflorus var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves and a single, showy white or pink flower that blooms during the day. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
