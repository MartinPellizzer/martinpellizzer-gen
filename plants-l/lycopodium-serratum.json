    "intro": "Lycopodium serratum, commonly known as the serrated clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often serrated at the edges. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine and horticultural interest have contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
