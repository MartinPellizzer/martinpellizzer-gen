    "intro": "Larix dahurica, commonly known as the Dahurian larch, is a species of coniferous tree native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden yellow in the autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is typically found in boreal and subarctic climates. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for construction and paper production. Larix dahurica is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting resilience to cold and poor soil conditions."
