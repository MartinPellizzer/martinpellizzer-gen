    "intro": "Lepidothamnus colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's lepidotea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lepidothamnus colensoi is an important species for both ecological and botanical studies in New Zealand's flora."
