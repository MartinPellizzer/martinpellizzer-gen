    "intro": "Lobelia laxiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
