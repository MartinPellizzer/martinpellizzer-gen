    "intro": "Limodorum flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-leaved lily, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its broad, fan-shaped leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Limodorum flabellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
