    "intro": "Lolium arvense var. muticum, commonly known as yellow oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, yellowish to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
