    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum subsp. paradoxum, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, blue-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
