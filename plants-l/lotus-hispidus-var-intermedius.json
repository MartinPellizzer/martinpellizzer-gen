    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. intermedius, commonly known as the hairy lotus or intermediate lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
