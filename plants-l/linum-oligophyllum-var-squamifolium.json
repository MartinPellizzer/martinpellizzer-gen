    "intro": "Linum oligophyllum var. squamifolium, commonly known as the scalyleaf flax, is a variant of the flax genus native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, scaly leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
