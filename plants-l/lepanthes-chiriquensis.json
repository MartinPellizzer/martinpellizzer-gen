    "intro": "Lepanthes chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes chiriquensis is often found in humid, shaded environments in cloud forests."
