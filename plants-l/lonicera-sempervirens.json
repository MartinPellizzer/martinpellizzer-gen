It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically appearing in spring. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
