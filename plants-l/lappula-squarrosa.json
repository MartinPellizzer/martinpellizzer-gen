It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features a slender, branching stem with hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in small, stiff hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lappula squarrosa is characterized by its distinctive, warty seed pods, which give it its common name."
