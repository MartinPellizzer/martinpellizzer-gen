    "intro": "Lonicera microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its species name \"microphylla,\" meaning \"small leaf.\" The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, usually yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lonicera microphylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
