    "intro": "Limodorum fasciola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tassel fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which includes several genera of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a tassel. Limodorum fasciola thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
