    "intro": "Lhotskya violacea var. merrilliana, commonly known as the Merrill's violet, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its deep violet to purple petals, which are often speckled with contrasting white or cream markings. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
