    "intro": "Lagotis pharica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lagotis pharica is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
