    "intro": "Loranthus surigaoensis, commonly known as the Surigao mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It is native to the Philippines, particularly in the region of Surigao. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting various insect populations."
