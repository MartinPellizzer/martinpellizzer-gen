    "intro": "Ludwigia quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-sided Ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its square stems, which give it its scientific name, and its striking red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, and it is often used in aquatic gardening as an ornamental plant. Ludwigia quadrangularis is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms."
