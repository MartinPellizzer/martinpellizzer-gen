    "intro": "Limnas arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into narrow, blade-like segments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Limnas arkansana is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
