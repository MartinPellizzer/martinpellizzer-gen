    "intro": "Leontodon montanus subsp. montaniformis, commonly known as the mountain leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
