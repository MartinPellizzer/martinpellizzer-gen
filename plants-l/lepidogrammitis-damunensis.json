    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis damunensis, commonly known as the Damun fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
