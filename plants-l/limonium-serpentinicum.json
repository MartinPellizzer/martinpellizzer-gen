    "intro": "Limonium serpentinicum, commonly known as the serpentine lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous or serpentine soils, which are often nutrient-poor and alkaline. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Limonium serpentinicum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
