    "intro": "Lespedeza griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to China and is part of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in woodland or open areas. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Lespedeza griffithii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality."
