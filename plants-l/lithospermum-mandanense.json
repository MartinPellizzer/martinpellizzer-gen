    "intro": "Lithospermum mandanense, commonly known as Mandan rock pepper, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Great Plains of North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, red or orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spindle-shaped roots that are rich in alkaloids and have been used traditionally by Native American tribes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in full sun. Lithospermum mandanense is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
