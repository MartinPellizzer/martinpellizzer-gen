    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacifolius, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and are arranged alternately along the stem. The flower head produces a cluster of yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
