It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.
