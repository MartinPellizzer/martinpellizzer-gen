    "intro": "Leonia gossypium, commonly known as the cotton plant, is a flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy bolls that contain the fibrous seed hairs used for textile production. The plant typically grows in warm climates and requires a long growing season with ample sunlight. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and it produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The cotton fibers are harvested when the bolls mature, usually in the fall."
