It is a low-growing perennial that features small, opposite leaves with a distinctive red or pinkish spot on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and early blooming habit."
