    "intro": "Lasthenia canescens, commonly known as the dusty everlasting or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
