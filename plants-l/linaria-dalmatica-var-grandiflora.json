    "intro": "Linaria dalmatica var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Dalmatian toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in non-native regions."
