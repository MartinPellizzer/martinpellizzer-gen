    "intro": "Linaria rudis, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Linaria rudis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
