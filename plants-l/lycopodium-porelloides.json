    "intro": "Lycopodium porelloides, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium porelloides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
