It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Lathyrus erectus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats."
