    "intro": "Lasianthaea belizeana, commonly known as the Belizean starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Central America, particularly Belize. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Due to habitat loss, Lasianthaea belizeana is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
