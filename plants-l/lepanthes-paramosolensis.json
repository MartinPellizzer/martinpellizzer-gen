    "intro": "Lepanthes paramosolensis, commonly known as the Paramo Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude paramo ecosystems of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the cold, humid conditions of the paramo. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Lepanthes paramosolensis plays an important ecological role in the paramo biome, contributing to biodiversity and pollinator interactions."
