    "intro": "Lycopodioides gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and whorled leaves that are needle-like in shape. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of many primitive plants. Lycopodioides gardneri is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina."
