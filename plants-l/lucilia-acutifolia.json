    "intro": "Lucilia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lucilia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Lucilia acutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
