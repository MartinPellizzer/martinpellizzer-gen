    "intro": "Lindera umbellata var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweet pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Lindera umbellata."
