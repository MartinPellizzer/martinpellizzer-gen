It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are white and fragrant. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in montane ecosystems."
