    "intro": "Lasiostelma gerrardii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Lasiostelma gerrardii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts."
