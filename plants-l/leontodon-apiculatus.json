    "intro": "Leontodon apiculatus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Leontodon apiculatus is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
