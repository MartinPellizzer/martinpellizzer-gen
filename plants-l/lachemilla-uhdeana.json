    "intro": "Lachemilla uhdeana, commonly known as the golden moss-rose, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the Andean region of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Lachemilla uhdeana is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
