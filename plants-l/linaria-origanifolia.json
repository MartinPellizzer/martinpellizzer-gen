It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often resemble those of oregano, hence its common name. Linaria origanifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
