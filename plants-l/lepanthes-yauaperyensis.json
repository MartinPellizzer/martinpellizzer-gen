    "intro": "Lepanthes yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. This epiphytic orchid is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. The plant has small, strap-like leaves and produces numerous tiny, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
