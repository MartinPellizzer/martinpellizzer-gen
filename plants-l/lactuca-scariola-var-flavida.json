    "intro": "Lactuca scariola var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow leaf lettuce, is a variant of the common sow thistle. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its yellowish leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in a loose cluster, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are often used in salads, though they are less common than other lettuce varieties."
