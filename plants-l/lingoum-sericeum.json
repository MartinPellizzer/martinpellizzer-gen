    "intro": "Lingoum sericeum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its slender, upright stems are often used in ornamental gardening for their delicate appearance. Lingoum sericeum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small insects and birds."
