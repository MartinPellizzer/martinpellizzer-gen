    "intro": "Lupinus jucundus, commonly known as the happy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus jucundus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
