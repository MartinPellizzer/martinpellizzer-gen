    "intro": "Liparis meniscophora, commonly known as the crescent-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that often curve slightly at the tips. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
