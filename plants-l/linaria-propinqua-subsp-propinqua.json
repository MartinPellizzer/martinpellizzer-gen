It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright yellow, spurred flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical characteristics include small, ovate leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in dry, disturbed soils. Linaria propinqua subsp. propinqua is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
