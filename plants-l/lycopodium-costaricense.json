    "intro": "Lycopodium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, spore-producing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a sporophytic structure with a stem that bears microphylls, which are simple leaves. It plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms. Lycopodium costaricense is typically found in the understory of humid forests in Central America."
