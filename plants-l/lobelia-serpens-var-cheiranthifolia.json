It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's unique floral structure makes it an attractive choice for native plant gardens."
