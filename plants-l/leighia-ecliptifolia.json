    "intro": "Leighia ecliptifolia, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its unique morphology includes elongated stems and specialized roots that help it anchor in difficult terrain. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Leighia ecliptifolia is considered an endangered species."
