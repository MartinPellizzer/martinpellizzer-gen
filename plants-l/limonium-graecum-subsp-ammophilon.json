It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along dunes and shores. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to coastal environments. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
