    "intro": "Lindsaea pendula, commonly known as the hanging lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that drape from its rhizome, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high moisture conditions. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Lindsaea pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
