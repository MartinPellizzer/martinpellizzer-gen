    "intro": "Lemna palustris, commonly known as the common duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming from the nodes along its stolons. It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is often used as a bioindicator of water quality. Its simple structure and fast growth make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
