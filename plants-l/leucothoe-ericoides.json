    "intro": "Leucothoe ericoides, commonly known as the southern waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands."
