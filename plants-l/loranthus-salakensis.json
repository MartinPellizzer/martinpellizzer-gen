    "intro": "Loranthus salakensis, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as Rhododendron species, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
