    "intro": "Lobelia granvikii, commonly known as the Granvik's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lobelia granvikii is considered a species of conservation concern."
