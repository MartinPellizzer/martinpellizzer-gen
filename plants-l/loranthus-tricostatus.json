    "intro": "Loranthus tricostatus, commonly known as the three-costate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus tricostatus is found in Australia and is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various bird species that rely on its fruit for food."
