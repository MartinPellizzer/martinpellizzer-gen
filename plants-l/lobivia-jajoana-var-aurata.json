    "intro": "Lobivia jajoana var. aurata, commonly known as the golden lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a striking golden or yellowish hue along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
