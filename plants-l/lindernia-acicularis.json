    "intro": "Lindernia acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf lindernia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lindernia acicularis is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
