    "intro": "Lonicera hispidula, commonly known as the rough honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds. Lonicera hispidula is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
