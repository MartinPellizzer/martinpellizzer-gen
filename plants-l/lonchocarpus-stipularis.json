    "intro": "Lonchocarpus stipularis, commonly known as the stipular legume, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a yellow or greenish hue. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds for dispersal."
