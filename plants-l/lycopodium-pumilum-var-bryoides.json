    "intro": "Lycopodium pumilum var. bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like clubmoss, is a small, terrestrial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, creeping stems that form dense, cushion-like mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in two rows along the stem. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
