    "intro": "Lepanthes cogolloi, commonly known as the Cogollo's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes cogolloi is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
