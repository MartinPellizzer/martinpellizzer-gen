    "intro": "Lepanthopsis bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
