    "intro": "Lycium americanum, commonly known as American wolfberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that ripen in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, and the berries are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh climates."
