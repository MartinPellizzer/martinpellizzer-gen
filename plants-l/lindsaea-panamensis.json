    "intro": "Lindsaea panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Lindsaea panamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
