It is characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern, which gives it a striking, curling appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stem with spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
