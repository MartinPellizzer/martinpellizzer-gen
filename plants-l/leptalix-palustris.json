    "intro": "Leptalix palustris, commonly known as the marsh leptalix, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to wetland environments in northern regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss, Leptalix palustris is considered endangered in many areas."
