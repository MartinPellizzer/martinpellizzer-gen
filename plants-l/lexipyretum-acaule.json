    "intro": "Lexipyretum acaule, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
