    "intro": "Leptopogon carinatus subvar. arctatus, commonly known as the Arctic lepidote, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils in tundra and alpine environments, where it tolerates extreme cold and short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are blue or violet in color, often appearing in clusters. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its high-latitude habitats."
