    "intro": "Lobelia heterophylla var. major, commonly known as the giant lobelia, is a striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
