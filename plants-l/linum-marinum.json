    "intro": "Linum marinum, commonly known as sea flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Sea flax is also valued for its historical use in textile production and as a source of linen fibers."
