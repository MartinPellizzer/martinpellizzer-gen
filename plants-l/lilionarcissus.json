    "intro": "Lilionarcissus, commonly known as the daffodil, is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically come in shades of yellow. The plant features a bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh winter conditions. Lilionarcissus species are native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. They are popular in gardens for their early spring blooms and their ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
