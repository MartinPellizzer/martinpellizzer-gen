    "intro": "Lastrea simulata, commonly known as the false sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lastrea simulata is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
