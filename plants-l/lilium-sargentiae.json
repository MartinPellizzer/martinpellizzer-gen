    "intro": "Lilium sargentiae, commonly known as Sargent's lily, is a rare and striking species of lily native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, with a distinctive recurved petal shape. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
