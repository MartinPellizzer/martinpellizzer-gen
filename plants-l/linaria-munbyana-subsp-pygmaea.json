    "intro": "Linaria munbyana subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that produce clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
