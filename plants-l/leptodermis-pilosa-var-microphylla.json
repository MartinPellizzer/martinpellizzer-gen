    "intro": "Leptodermis pilosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, densely packed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing moisture. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments."
