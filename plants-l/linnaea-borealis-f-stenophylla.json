    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Its flowers are usually borne in pairs, giving the plant its common name. This botanical form exhibits distinct morphological differences from the typical Linnaea borealis, particularly in leaf structure and flower arrangement."
