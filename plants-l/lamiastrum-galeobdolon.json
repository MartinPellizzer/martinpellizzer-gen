    "intro": "Lamiastrum galeobdolon, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
