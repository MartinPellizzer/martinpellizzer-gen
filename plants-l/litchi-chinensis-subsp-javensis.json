    "intro": "Litchi chinensis subsp. javensis, commonly known as the Java litchi, is a subtropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces large, hairy fruits with a thick, red-brown rind and a juicy, sweet flesh containing numerous seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires a long growing season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and glossy, while the flowers are fragrant and white. The subspecies is closely related to the common litchi (L. chinensis) but is distinguished by its slightly smaller fruit size and different geographic distribution."
