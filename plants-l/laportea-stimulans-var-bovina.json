    "intro": "Laportea stimulans var. bovina, commonly known as the bison's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellowish-white flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant's common name is derived from its historical use by Native American tribes for its purported medicinal properties."
