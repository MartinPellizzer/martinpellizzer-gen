    "intro": "Leptinella dioica, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Leptinella dioica is characterized by its dioecious nature, with separate male and female flowers on different plants."
