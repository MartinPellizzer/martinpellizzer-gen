    "intro": "Lepisorus sungpanensis, commonly known as the Sungpan moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture and a bluish-green hue when mature. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
