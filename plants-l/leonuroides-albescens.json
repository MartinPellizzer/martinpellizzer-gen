    "intro": "Leonuroides albescens, commonly known as the white-leaved leonuroid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
