    "intro": "Leptocarpus monostylis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, linear leaves and produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation by tidal waters. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal vegetation in its native habitat."
