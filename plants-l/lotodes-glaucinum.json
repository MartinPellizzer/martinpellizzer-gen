    "intro": "Lotodes glaucinum, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, often with a bluish tint. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond or lake bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water. Lotodes glaucinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
