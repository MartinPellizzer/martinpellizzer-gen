    "intro": "Lomatium triternatum var. alatum, commonly known as the western lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
