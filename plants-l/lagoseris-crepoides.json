    "intro": "Lagoseris crepoides, commonly known as the creeping lagoseri, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lagoseris crepoides is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
