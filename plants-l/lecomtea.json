It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that shimmer in the sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Lecomtea thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
