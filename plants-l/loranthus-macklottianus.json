    "intro": "Loranthus macklottianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain birds and insects."
