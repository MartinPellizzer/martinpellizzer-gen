    "intro": "Loranthus memecylifolius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that contain adhesive seeds, aiding in its propagation. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to forest ecosystems."
