It features slender, branched stems that produce clusters of bright yellow to orange tubular flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought tolerance. While it is ornamental, it can be invasive in some regions, making it a plant of both beauty and ecological concern."
