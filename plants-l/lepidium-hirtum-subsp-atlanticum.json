    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it thrives in saline and well-drained environments. The plant features small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped. It has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
