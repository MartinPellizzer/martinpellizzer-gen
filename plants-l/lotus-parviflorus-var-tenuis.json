    "intro": "Lotus parviflorus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender-flowered water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically light green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and bloom in the early morning, often closing by midday. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
