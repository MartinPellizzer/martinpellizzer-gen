    "intro": "Linaria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Linaria pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
