    "intro": "Laserpitium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Laserpitium alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
