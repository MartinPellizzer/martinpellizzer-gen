    "intro": "Ledum groenlandicum f. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf Labrador tea, is a compact shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and emit a strong, resinous scent. This form is typically shorter and more compact than the typical form of Ledum groenlandicum, making it well adapted to harsh, cold environments."
