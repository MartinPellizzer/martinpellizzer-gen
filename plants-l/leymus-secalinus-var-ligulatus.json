    "intro": "Leymus secalinus var. ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in disturbed or marginal soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
