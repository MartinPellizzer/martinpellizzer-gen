    "intro": "Luzula nutans, commonly known as nodding wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Juncaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that droop downward, giving it a nodding appearance. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural setting."
