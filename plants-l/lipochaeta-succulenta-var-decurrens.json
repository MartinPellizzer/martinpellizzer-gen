    "intro": "Lipochaeta succulenta var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping lipochaeta, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Argentina. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
