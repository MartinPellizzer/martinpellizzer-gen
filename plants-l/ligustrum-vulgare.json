    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare, commonly known as European privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, spherical berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
