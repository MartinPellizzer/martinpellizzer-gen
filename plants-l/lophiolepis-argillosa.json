    "intro": "Lophiolepis argillosa, commonly known as the clay lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in moist, clay-rich environments. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically dark green to black, and it often forms a thin, adherent layer on soil or rock surfaces. It is commonly found in temperate regions with high humidity and is an indicator of acidic soils. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
