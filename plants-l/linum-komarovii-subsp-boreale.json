    "intro": "Linum komarovii subsp. boreale, commonly known as the Arctic flax, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Linum komarovii subsp. boreale is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
