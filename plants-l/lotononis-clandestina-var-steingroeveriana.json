    "intro": "Lotononis clandestina var. steingroeveriana, commonly known as the Cape mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy flowers and succulent-like structures."
