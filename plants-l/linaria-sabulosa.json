    "intro": "Linaria sabulosa, commonly known as sand toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Linaria sabulosa is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
