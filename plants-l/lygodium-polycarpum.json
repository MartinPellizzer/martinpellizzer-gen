    "intro": "Lygodium polycarpum, commonly known as the common climbing fern, is a tropical fern species belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lygodium polycarpum is known for its ability to climb and spread rapidly, making it both a common garden weed and an important component of forest ecosystems."
