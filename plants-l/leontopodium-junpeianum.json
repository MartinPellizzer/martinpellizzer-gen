    "intro": "Leontopodium junpeianum, commonly known as the Yunnan edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-centered flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology, including the thick, hairy leaves and compact growth form, helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
