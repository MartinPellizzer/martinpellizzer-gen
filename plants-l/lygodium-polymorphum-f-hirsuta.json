It is a fern with a distinctive, creeping rhizome that produces upright, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
