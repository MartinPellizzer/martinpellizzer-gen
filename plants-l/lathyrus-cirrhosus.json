    "intro": "Lathyrus cirrhosus, commonly known as the curly vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, winding stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lathyrus cirrhosus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and sustainable agriculture."
