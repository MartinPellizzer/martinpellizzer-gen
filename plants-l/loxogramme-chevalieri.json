    "intro": "Loxogramme chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the mountain streams of Southeast Asia. It has delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged in water, forming a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant thrives in cool, clear, and oxygen-rich environments, often found in fast-flowing streams. Its spores are released in the form of small, floating clusters, which help in dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
