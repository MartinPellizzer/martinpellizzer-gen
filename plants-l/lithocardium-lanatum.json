    "intro": "Lithocardium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its thick, woolly covering helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lithocardium lanatum is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
