    "intro": "Lastrea thelypteris var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The pubescent variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which may aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
