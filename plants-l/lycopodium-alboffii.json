    "intro": "Lycopodium alboffii, commonly known as the white-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, slender, often white or pale green stem. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of its ancient lineage within the lycophytes. The plant's structure reflects its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant with a simple, yet efficient, reproductive system."
