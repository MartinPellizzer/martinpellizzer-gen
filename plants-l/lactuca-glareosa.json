    "intro": "Lactuca glareosa, commonly known as the glaucous lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by seeds dispersed by the wind. Lactuca glareosa is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive."
