    "intro": "Lobelia candida, commonly known as white cardinal flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, tubular white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
