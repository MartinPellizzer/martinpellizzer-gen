    "intro": "Lemna thermalis, commonly known as the thermal water lettuce, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It belongs to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, rosette-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its high growth rate, it can be both a useful indicator of water quality and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
