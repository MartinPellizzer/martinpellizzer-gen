    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. pyramidale, commonly known as the European privet, is a compact, pyramidal shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green, oval leaves that are arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, upright growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
