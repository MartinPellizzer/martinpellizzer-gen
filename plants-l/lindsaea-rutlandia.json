    "intro": "Lindsaea rutlandia, commonly known as the Rutland's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen habit with dense foliage. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the branches. Lindsaea rutlandia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
