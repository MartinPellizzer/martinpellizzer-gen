    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. heterochroa, commonly known as the heterochroous twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. This plant is characterized by its distinctive two-lipped flowers, which are often a striking combination of white and purple or red, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and shaded woodlands. The plant's unique floral morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
