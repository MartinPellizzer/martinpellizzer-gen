    "intro": "Lycium repens, commonly known as trailing nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Lycium repens is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
