    "intro": "Larix decidua var. decidua, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, giving it a striking appearance in the fall. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, and it can grow to heights of up to 30 meters. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
