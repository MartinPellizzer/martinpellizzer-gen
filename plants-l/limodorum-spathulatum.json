    "intro": "Limodorum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and pets. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens. Its ornamental value is often balanced by its potential toxicity, making it a plant that requires careful handling."
