    "intro": "Loranthus validus, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity. Loranthus validus is also culturally significant, particularly in European traditions during the holiday season."
