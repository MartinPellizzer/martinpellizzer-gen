It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved inward, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, three-lobed flowers. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
