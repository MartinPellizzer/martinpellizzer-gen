    "intro": "Leptorkis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated leptorkis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its unique morphology, including the rostrated (beak-like) structure of its fruits, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
