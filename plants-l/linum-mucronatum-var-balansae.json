    "intro": "Linum mucronatum var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae flax, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers. The leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are clustered in dense racemes. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and habitat specificity, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
