    "intro": "Litsea latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth upper surface with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are initially green and turn red when mature. Litsea latifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses. It is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
