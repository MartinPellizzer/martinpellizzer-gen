It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Leontodon gussonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
