    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis minima, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on stems that rise from a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
