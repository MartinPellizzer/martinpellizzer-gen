    "intro": "Lolium strictum var. humile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It plays a role in forage production and can be used in ecological restoration projects. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers contribute to its reproductive success in natural habitats."
