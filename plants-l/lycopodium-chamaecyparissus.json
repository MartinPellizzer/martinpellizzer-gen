It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that resembles a miniature pine tree. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Lycopodium chamaecyparissus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
