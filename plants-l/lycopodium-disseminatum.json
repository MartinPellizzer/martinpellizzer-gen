    "intro": "Lycopodium disseminatum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophyte generation is dominant, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium disseminatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
