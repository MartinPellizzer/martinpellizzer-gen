It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
