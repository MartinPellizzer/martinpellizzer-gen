    "intro": "Laurus nobilis f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf laurel, is a cultivar of the bay laurel plant. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are darker green and have a more pronounced aromatic scent compared to the standard bay leaf. This variety thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. The leaves are often used in cooking, similar to the common bay leaf, and are also valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens. It is a slow-growing shrub that can be pruned to maintain a compact shape."
