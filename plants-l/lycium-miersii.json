    "intro": "Lycium miersii, commonly known as the Miers' boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Lycium miersii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry climates."
