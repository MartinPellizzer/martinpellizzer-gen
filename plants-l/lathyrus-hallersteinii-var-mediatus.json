It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open to release small, angular seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting nearby plants."
