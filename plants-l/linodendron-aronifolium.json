It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that often display a striking golden hue, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes. However, it requires well-drained soil and a humid environment to thrive."
