    "intro": "Lonicera dioica f. trifolia, commonly known as the trifoliate honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
