    "intro": "Ludwigia palustris var. liebmannii, commonly known as the swamp Ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in aquatic gardens and as a water garden plant."
