    "intro": "Lycopodium springii, commonly known as the spring clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, a characteristic feature of the Lycopodiaceae family. Lycopodium springii is often found in rocky or crevice habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
