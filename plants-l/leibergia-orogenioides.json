    "intro": "Leibergia orogenioides, commonly known as the mountain leibergia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of candles. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base, while its flowers bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
