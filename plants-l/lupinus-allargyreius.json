It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Lupinus allargyreius is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil fertility."
