    "intro": "Lophophora diffusa subsp. fricii, commonly known as the \"Crazy Daisy,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its lack of spines and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its striking appearance and unique growth habits, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
