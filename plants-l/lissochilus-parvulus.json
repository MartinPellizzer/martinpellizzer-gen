It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
