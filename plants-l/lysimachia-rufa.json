    "intro": "Lysimachia rufa, commonly known as redstem filaree, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. Lysimachia rufa is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
