    "intro": "Lobivia salitrensis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the curled lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces tall, branched stems with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to succulent collections."
