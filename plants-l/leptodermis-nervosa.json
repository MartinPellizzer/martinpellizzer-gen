    "intro": "Leptodermis nervosa, commonly known as the slender skin fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
