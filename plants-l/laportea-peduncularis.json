    "intro": "Laportea peduncularis, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in terminal spikes. Its stinging hairs, similar to those of true nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact. Laportea peduncularis is often found in wetlands and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
