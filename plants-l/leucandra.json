    "intro": "Leucandra, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Leucandra species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season. These trees are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
