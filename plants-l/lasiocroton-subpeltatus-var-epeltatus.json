It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
