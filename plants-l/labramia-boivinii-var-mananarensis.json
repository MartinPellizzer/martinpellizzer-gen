    "intro": "Labramia boivinii var. mananarensis, commonly known as the Mananarensis Labramia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments within tropical rainforests. It has small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered critically endangered."
