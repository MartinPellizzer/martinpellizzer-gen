    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. commune, commonly known as perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is widely cultivated for forage and turfgrass. Its rapid growth and high nutritional value make it a popular choice in agricultural and horticultural settings."
