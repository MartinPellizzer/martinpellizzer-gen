    "intro": "Lobivia conoidea, commonly known as the conical lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
