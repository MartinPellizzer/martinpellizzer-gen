    "intro": "Lepidium cardamine, commonly known as hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, often with a distinctive lobed or toothed shape. It produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lepidium cardamine is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in moist soils along roadsides and in gardens."
