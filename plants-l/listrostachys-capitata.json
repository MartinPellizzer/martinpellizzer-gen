    "intro": "Listrostachys capitata, commonly known as the clustered bract grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its root system is fibrous and well-developed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
