    "intro": "Loranthus macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees if left unchecked."
