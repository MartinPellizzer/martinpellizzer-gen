    "intro": "Limniris ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Eastern Europe. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, and it plays a role in water filtration and habitat creation. Limniris ruthenica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
