    "intro": "Loranthus irebuensis, commonly known as the Irua or African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly Nigeria, and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as *Ficus* and *Euphorbia*. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees for germination. Loranthus irebuensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
