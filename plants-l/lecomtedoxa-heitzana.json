    "intro": "Lecomtedoxa heitzana, commonly known as the Heitzan lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
