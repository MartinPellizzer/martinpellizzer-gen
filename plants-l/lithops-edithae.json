    "intro": "Lithops edithae, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, allowing it to blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, which are typically green with red or purple markings. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. Lithops edithae is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water to thrive."
