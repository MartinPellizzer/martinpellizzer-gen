    "intro": "Loranthus daphnoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic."
