    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum var. coeruleum, commonly known as blue flax, is a cultivated variant of the common flax plant. It is characterized by its striking blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has slender, branched stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, while the flowers are clustered in loose spikes. This variety is primarily grown for its ornamental value and for the blue dye it produces from its seeds."
