    "intro": "Linaria flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria flexuosa thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
