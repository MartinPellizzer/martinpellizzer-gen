    "intro": "Lastreopsis recedens, commonly known as the creeping lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, layered structure with a dark, leathery upper surface and a lighter, spongy lower layer. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
