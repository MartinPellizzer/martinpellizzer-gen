    "intro": "Lomaria aculeata, commonly known as the spiny lomaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, branching stems covered in sharp, backward-pointing spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Lomaria aculeata thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
