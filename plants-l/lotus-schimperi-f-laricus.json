    "intro": "Lotus schimperi f. laricus, commonly known as the Ethiopian lotus, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
