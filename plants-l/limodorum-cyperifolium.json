    "intro": "Limodorum cyperifolium, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, muddy soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
