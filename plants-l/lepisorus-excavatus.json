    "intro": "Lepisorus excavatus, commonly known as the hollow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Lepisorus excavatus is noted for its unique leaf structure, with the central vein often appearing hollow, giving it its common name."
