    "intro": "Lepisorus kuratae, commonly known as the Kurata's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately compound and covered in fine, hairy structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Lepisorus kuratae is native to parts of Asia, including Japan and China, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
