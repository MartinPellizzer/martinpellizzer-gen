    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. erecta, commonly known as the upright tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and arranged in a dense, upright clump. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, three-ranked flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
