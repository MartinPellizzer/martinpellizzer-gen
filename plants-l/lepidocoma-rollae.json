    "intro": "Lepidocoma rollae, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seed heads that resemble dandelion seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Lepidocoma rollae is a perennial plant that is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
