It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
