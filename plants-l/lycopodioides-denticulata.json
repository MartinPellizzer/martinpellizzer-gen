It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in various ecosystems."
