    "intro": "Lonicera flavipes, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are yellow in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are orange-red when mature, are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals."
