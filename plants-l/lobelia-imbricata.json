It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
