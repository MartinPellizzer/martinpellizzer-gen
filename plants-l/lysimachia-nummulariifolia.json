    "intro": "Lysimachia nummulariifolia, commonly known as golden moss or coinleaf speedwell, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers throughout the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady gardens."
