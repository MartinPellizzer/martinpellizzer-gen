    "intro": "Loranthus eminii, commonly known as the Himalayan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region. It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
