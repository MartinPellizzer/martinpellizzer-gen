    "intro": "Latania, commonly known as the African palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar and the Comoros Islands. They are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Latania species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine. Their fruit produces a hard, inedible seed that is dispersed by wind or animals."
