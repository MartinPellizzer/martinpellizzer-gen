    "intro": "Lumnitzera pentandra, commonly known as the mangrove button or sea hibiscus, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lumnitzera pentandra plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
