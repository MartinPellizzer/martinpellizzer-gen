It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, hairy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
