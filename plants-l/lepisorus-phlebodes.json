    "intro": "Lepisorus phlebodes, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus phlebodes is often found in rocky crevices and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
