    "intro": "Lonicera similis, commonly known as the Chinese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its twining stems. Its berries, which are orange-red when mature, are edible but often have a bitter taste. Lonicera similis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
