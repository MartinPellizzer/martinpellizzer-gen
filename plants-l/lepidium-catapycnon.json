It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. Lepidium catapycnon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
