    "intro": "Lapathum maximum, commonly known as greater hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, ridged stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often with purple spots and coarse hairs. The plant has large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive, wavy margin and a strong, unpleasant odor. It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
