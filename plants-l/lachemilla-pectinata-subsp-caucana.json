    "intro": "Lachemilla pectinata subsp. caucana, commonly known as the Andean stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes mountains. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it well-suited for alpine gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
