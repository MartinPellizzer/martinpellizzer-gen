    "intro": "Lophidium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive dichotomous growth pattern. It is characterized by its branched, filamentous thallus that splits into two equal branches at regular intervals. This plant typically grows on bark or stone in moist, shaded environments. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
