    "intro": "Lecythis tuberculata, commonly known as the giant lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces distinctive, woody fruits that enclose a single, large seed. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and is known for its rapid growth rate in the rainforest. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine, and the tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
