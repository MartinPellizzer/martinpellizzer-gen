    "intro": "Lepiniopsis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
