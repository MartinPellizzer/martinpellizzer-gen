It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oblanceolate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, with four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The plant is also notable for its fine, velvety pubescence, which gives it its common name."
