It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
