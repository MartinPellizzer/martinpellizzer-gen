    "intro": "Lapsana zazyntha, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features yellow flowers that are typically arranged in flat-topped clusters, and its leaves are finely divided with a distinctive aromatic scent. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
