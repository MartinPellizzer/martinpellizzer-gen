    "intro": "Listrostachys hamata, commonly known as the hairy spiny bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, spiny pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
