    "intro": "Lobelia myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, tubular, and usually blue or purple in color. Lobelia myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
