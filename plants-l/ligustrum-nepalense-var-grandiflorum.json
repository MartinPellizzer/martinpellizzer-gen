    "intro": "Ligustrum nepalense var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the Nepal privet, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at moderate elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
