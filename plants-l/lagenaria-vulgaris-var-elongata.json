    "intro": "Lagenaria vulgaris var. elongata, commonly known as the bottle gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical fruit that can grow up to several meters in length, often used as a container or for culinary purposes. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that transition into the elongated fruit. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. The fruit is typically harvested when still green, though it can also be allowed to mature and turn orange or brown."
