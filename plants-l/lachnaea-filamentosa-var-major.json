    "intro": "Lachnaea filamentosa var. major, commonly known as the giant lichen moss, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in specific, often harsh environments. It is characterized by its intricate, filamentous growth form, which allows it to colonize rocky or barren substrates. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize in low-nutrient conditions. Its botanical structure includes a dense mat of leaf-like structures that help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
