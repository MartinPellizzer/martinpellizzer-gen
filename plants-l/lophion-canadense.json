    "intro": "Lophion canadense, commonly known as the Canadian lophion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
