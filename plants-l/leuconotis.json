These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Leuconotis species are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
