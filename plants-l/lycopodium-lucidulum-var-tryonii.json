    "intro": "Lycopodium lucidulum var. tryonii, commonly known as the Tryon's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a prostrate or upright stem with spirally arranged leaves that are narrowly linear and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobili at the base of the leaves, which contain the reproductive organs. This variant is notable for its morphological distinctiveness and is often found in specific geographic regions across North America."
