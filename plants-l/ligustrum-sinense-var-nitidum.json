    "intro": "Ligustrum sinense var. nitidum, commonly known as glossy privet, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The variety 'nitidum' is distinguished by its particularly shiny leaves, which give it a polished appearance."
