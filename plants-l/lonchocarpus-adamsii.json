    "intro": "Lonchocarpus adamsii, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with yellow veins. The plant produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
