    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. acrifolium, commonly known as the black fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces spore-bearing fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant's fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, needle-like segments that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
