    "intro": "Lophostoma ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color and has a broad, leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Lophostoma ovatum is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
