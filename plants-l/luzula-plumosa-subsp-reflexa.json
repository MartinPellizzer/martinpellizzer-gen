    "intro": "Luzula plumosa subsp. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear dense clusters of soft, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas."
