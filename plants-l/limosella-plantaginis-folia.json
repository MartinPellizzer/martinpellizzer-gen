    "intro": "Limosella plantaginis-folia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant typically has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed sandy areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize coastal soils."
