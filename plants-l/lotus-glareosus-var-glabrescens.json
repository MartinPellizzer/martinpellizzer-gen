    "intro": "Lotus glareosus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair, which becomes less prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
