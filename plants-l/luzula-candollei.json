    "intro": "Luzula candollei, commonly known as the Alpine woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Luzula candollei is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
