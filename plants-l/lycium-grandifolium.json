    "intro": "Lycium grandifolium, commonly known as the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and parts of Asia. It features woody stems with thorny branches and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in Chinese herbal medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
