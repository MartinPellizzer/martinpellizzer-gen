    "intro": "Lappula anoplocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf lappula, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Camelotaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that contain the seeds. Lappula anoplocarpa is generally short-lived and has a limited geographic distribution."
