    "intro": "Linanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations, often in open meadows or along stream banks. Its linear leaves and showy inflorescence make it a distinctive sight in its natural habitat. Linanthus montanus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
