    "intro": "Lotodes corylifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has large, shield-shaped leaves that are typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are often floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
