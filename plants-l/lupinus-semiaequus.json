    "intro": "Lupinus semiaequus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with 5-7 leaflets, and its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus semiaequus thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
