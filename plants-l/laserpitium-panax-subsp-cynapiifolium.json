    "intro": "Laserpitium panax subsp. cynapiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lungwort, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the gentian family (Gentianaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The flowers are typically blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, and are tubular in shape. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
