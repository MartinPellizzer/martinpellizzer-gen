It belongs to the family Aceraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
