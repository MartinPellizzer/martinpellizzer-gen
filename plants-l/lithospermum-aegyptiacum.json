    "intro": "Lithospermum aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian rock pepper, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The roots of Lithospermum aegyptiacum contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
