    "intro": "Loranthus usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily figs and euphorbias, through a specialized root system called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, Loranthus usambarensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
