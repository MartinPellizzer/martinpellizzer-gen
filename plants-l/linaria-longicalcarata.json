    "intro": "Linaria longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-beaked toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant produces small, oblong seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria longicalcarata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
