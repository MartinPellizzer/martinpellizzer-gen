    "intro": "Lithocardium caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasan lithocardium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
