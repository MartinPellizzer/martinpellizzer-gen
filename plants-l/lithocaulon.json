    "intro": "Lithocaulon, commonly known as the rock-cushion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plants typically have small, fleshy leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Lithocaulon species are native to southern Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. They are well adapted to harsh environments, with thick stems and leaves that help store water and reduce transpiration."
