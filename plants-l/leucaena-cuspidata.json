    "intro": "Leucaena cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often trifoliate, with each leaflet having a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Leucaena cuspidata is also valued for its fast growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agroforestry systems."
