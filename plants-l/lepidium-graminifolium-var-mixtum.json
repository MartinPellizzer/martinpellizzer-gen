    "intro": "Lepidium graminifolium var. mixtum, commonly known as the mixed leaf wallflower, is a variant of the common wallflower species. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or spreading, with small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a grass-like appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
