It features compound leaves with a distinct, narrow shape, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures. Its reproductive structures are well adapted for spore dispersal in moist conditions."
