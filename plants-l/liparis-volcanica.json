    "intro": "Liparis volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils found in areas with recent volcanic activity. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrate. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
