    "intro": "Liparis alpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a delicate appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Liparis alpina is known for its ability to adapt to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient member of high-altitude flora."
