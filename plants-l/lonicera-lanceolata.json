    "intro": "Lonicera lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, which are usually yellow or orange in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera lanceolata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
