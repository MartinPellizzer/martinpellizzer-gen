It is characterized by its erect growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus rubricaulis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
