    "intro": "Ligustrum punctatum, commonly known as the dotted privet, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It features small, ovate leaves with distinctive white or yellowish dots on the underside, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. Ligustrum punctatum is adaptable to various soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
