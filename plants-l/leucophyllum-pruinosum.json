    "intro": "Leucophyllum pruinosum, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Leucophyllum pruinosum is also valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
