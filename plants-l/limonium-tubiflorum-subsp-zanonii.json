    "intro": "Limonium tubiflorum subsp. zanonii, commonly known as the Zanonii sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
