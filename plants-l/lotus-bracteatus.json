    "intro": "Lotus bracteatus, commonly known as the golden lotus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in humid conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, and the stems are often submerged or floating. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous pod, which disperses them when dried."
