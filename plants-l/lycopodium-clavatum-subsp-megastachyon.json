    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum subsp. megastachyon, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a perennial fern-like plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
