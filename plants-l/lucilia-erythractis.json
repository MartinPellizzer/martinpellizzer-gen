    "intro": "Lucilia erythractis, commonly known as the red-legged flesh fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its distinctive red legs and a metallic blue or green body coloration. This fly is often found near decaying organic matter, where it lays its eggs. The larvae, known as maggots, play a role in the decomposition process. Lucilia erythractis is also used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations."
