    "intro": "Lobelia fenshamii, commonly known as Fensham's lobelia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the wetlands of New South Wales, Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged habitats. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Lobelia fenshamii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
