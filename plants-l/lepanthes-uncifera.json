    "intro": "Lepanthes uncifera, commonly known as the sharp-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
