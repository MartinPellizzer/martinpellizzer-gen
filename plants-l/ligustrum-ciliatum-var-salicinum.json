It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
