    "intro": "Ligusticopsis acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed ligusticum, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
