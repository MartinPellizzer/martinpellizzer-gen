    "intro": "Lagerstroemia pterosepala, commonly known as the white lagerstroemia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical and tropical climates. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
