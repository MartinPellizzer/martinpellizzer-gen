    "intro": "Liatris heterophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the central and southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to purple spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight twist, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Liatris heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native pollinator populations."
