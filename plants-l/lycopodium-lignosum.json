    "intro": "Lycopodium lignosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Lycopodium lignosum is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of spores for scientific study."
