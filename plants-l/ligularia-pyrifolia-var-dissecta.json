    "intro": "Ligularia pyrifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected heartleaf arum, is a striking perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deeply dissected appearance, giving it a dramatic and ornamental look. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are borne on a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and bog gardens."
