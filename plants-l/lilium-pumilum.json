    "intro": "Lilium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it one of the smallest members of the lily family. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Lilium pumilum is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments."
