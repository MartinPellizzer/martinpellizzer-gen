It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in wet, swampy habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It is often found in moist woodlands and along the edges of ponds and streams."
