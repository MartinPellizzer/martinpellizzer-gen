    "intro": "Lepidium montanum subsp. spathulatum, commonly known as the mountain cress, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some traditional herbal practices."
