    "intro": "Lilium wallichianum var. wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its bulbous root system is typical of many lily species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions. The flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
