    "intro": "Lingnania, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, pale green flowers that resemble small, ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lingnania is known for its short blooming period, usually in late spring, and is considered a delicately beautiful yet elusive species."
