    "intro": "Listrostachys urostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
