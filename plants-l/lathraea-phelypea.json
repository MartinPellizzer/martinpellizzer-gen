    "intro": "Lathraea phelypea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It derives its nutrients from the roots of other plants, typically growing in association with grasses and shrubs. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a specialized ecological role in its native habitats."
