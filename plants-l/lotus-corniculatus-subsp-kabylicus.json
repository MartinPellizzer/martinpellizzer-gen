It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It is characterized by its slender stems and distinctive seed pods that curl into a spiral shape. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
