    "intro": "Libanus, commonly known as the cedar of Lebanon, is a majestic evergreen tree native to the Eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the genus Cedrus and is characterized by its tall, conical shape and aromatic, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to winged seeds, facilitating wind pollination and dispersal. Libanus is renowned for its durable, fragrant wood, which has been used for centuries in construction and religious artifacts. Its ecological and cultural significance has made it a symbol of strength and endurance in ancient and modern times."
