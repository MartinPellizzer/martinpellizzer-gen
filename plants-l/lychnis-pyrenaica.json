    "intro": "Lychnis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces striking pink to reddish-purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Lychnis pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
