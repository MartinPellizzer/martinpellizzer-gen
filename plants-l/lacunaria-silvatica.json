    "intro": "Lacunaria silvatica, commonly known as the forest lily, is a perennial herb native to temperate woodlands. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded environments. Lacunaria silvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
