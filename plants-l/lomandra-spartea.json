    "intro": "Lomandra spartea, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact rosette, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, tall spikes of white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant. Lomandra spartea is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
