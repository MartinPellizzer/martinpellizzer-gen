    "intro": "Lonicera xylosteum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and dark green, with a slightly hairy underside in some varieties. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
