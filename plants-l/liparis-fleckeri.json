    "intro": "Liparis fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forests. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis fleckeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
