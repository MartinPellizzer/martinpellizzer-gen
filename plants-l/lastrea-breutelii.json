    "intro": "Lastrea breutelii, commonly known as the Breutel's lastrea, is a species of succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Lastrea breutelii is often sought after by succulent enthusiasts and botanists alike."
