    "intro": "Lophiolepis bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Cape York fern, is a rare and endemic species native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
