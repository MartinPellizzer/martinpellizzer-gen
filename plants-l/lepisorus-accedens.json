    "intro": "Lepisorus accedens, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves, and it produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Lepisorus accedens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
