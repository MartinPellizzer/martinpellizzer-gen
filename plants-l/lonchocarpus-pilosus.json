    "intro": "Lonchocarpus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy urara, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it valuable in soil enrichment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, hairy seeds enclosed in a tough, woody pod. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
