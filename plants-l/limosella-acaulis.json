    "intro": "Limosella acaulis, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Limosella acaulis is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
