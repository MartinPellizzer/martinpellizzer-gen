    "intro": "Ligeria andina, commonly known as the Andean ligeria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often bright, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Ligeria andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
