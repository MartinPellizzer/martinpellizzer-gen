    "intro": "Lobelia elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly in the Mount Elgon area. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mountainous slopes. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach up to 1 meter in height. Lobelia elgonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
