It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, aromatic bark. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a significant component of the forest canopy. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters.
