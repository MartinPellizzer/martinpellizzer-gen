    "intro": "Lespedeza angustifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, pink to reddish flowers appear in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. Lespedeza angustifolia var. brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
