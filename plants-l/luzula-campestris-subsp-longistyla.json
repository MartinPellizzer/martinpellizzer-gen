    "intro": "Luzula campestris subsp. longistyla, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purplish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact rosette at the base. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more robust stems compared to the typical form of Luzula campestris."
