It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
