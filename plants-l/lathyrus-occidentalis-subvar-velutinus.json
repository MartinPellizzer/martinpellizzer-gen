    "intro": "Lathyrus occidentalis subvar. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
