    "intro": "Lespedeza bicolor var. sericea, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces clusters of pea-like, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Silky lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
