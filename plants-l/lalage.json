It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped blooms that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and red. The plant typically features strap-like leaves and produces clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.

They are also noted for their ability to bloom reliably in temperate climates."
