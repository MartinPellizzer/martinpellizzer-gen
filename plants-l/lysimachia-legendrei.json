    "intro": "Lysimachia legendrei, commonly known as the Legendrei goldenthread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
