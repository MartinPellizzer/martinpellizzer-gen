    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. inflatum, commonly known as the spotted dead nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red or purple markings and produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
