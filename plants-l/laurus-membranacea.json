    "intro": "Laurus membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by black, oval berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
