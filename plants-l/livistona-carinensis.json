    "intro": "Livistona carinensis, commonly known as the crowned palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a distinctive crown of pinnate leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling small coconuts. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Livistona carinensis is well adapted to coastal and humid environments, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical landscapes."
