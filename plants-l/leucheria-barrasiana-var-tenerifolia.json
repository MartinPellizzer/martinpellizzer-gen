It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests. The plant features a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. It has specific mycorrhizal associations that are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
