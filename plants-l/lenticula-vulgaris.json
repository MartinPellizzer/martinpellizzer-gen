    "intro": "Lenticula vulgaris, commonly known as the common lentic, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often tart. Lenticula vulgaris is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
