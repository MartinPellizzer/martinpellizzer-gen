    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus var. frolovii, commonly known as the Siberian pea shrub, is a perennial legume native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, twining stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are heart-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
