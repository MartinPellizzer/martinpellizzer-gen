    "intro": "Lycium hieronymi, commonly known as the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Lycium hieronymi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in non-native regions."
