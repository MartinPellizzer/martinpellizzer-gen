    "intro": "Limodorum bidens, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and two small, opposite leaves that are often reduced to sheathing structures. The plant produces a single, erect flower with a distinctive lip that is typically yellow or greenish-yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Limodorum bidens is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations."
