    "intro": "Linaria chalepensis var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, characteristic of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
