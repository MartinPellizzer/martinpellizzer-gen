    "intro": "Lemurangis alleizettei, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of dense rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lemurangis alleizettei is considered a critically endangered species."
