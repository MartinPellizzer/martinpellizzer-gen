    "intro": "Lepechinia humilis, commonly known as the low lousewort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces delicate, pinkish-purple flowers in late summer. It is part of the Boraginaceae family, which is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
