    "intro": "Lycopodium spurium, commonly known as the ground pine, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that resemble pine needles. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are released from cone-like structures called strobili. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. Lycopodium spurium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
