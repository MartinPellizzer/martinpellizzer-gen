It belongs to the family Lejeuneaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often overlapping leaves. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its structure is complex, with a thallus that is often branched and covered in a layer of fine, moss-like filaments. This variant is distinguished by its specific morphology and habitat preferences, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
