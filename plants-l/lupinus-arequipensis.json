    "intro": "Lupinus arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa lupine, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of southern Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces sparsely branched inflorescences of pea-shaped flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink. Lupinus arequipensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by fixing nitrogen and supporting pollinator populations."
