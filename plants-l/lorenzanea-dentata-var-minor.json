It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, serrated leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal panicles during the late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and adaptability to well-drained soils."
