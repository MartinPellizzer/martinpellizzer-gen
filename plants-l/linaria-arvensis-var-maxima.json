It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that grows up to 60 cm tall, characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
