    "intro": "Lamprococcus brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked lamprococcus, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its small, oval body covered in a waxy, shield-like covering. The plant it infests is typically a woody species, where it feeds on sap, causing localized damage. Its life cycle involves several nymphal stages before reaching adulthood. Due to its cryptic appearance and limited host range, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
