    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. compositum, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Timothy grass is valued for its high nutritional value and is commonly used as forage for livestock."
