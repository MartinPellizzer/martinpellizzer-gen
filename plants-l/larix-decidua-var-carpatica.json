    "intro": "Larix decidua var. carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
