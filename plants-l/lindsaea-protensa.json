    "intro": "Lindsaea protensa, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that form a dense, upright rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea protensa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
