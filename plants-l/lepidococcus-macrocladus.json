    "intro": "Lepidococcus macrocladus, commonly known as the giant feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, needle-like leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Lepidococcus macrocladus plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
