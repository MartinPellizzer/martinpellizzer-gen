    "intro": "Leontodon longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, with the ray florets being yellow and the disc florets tubular. It produces a distinctive, elongated, and hairy pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This plant is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows across Europe and parts of Asia."
