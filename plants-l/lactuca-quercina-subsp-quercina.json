    "intro": "Lactuca quercina subsp. quercina, commonly known as the oakleaf lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, oak-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a lesser-known but flavorful lettuce variety. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its unique foliage."
