    "intro": "Lolium compositum, commonly known as the composite grass or yellow grass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides. Lolium compositum is sometimes used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
