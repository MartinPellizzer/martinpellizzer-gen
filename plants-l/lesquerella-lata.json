    "intro": "Lesquerella lata, commonly known as the broadleaf lesquerella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds contain a valuable oil used in industrial applications, including as a substitute for tung oil. Lesquerella lata is also of interest for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions."
