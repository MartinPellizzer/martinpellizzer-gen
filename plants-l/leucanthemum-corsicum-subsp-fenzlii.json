    "intro": "Leucanthemum corsicum subsp. fenzlii, commonly known as the Corsican Edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its white, daisy-like flowers with a central yellow disc, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It has silver-gray foliage with woolly hairs, and its stems are usually covered in a similar fuzzy coating. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Leucanthemum genus, which are known for their ornamental value and ecological significance in mountainous habitats."
