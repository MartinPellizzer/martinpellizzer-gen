    "intro": "Linaria stricta, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Linaria stricta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats."
