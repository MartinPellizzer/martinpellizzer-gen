It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with the youngest leaves at the center. This variety is distinguished by its narrow leaf shape and distinctive marginal lobes."
