    "intro": "Lomaria discolor var. nuda, commonly known as the naked lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairless, giving it its \"nuda\" designation. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in wild habitats."
