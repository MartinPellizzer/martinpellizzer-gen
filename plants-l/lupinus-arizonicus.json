    "intro": "Lupinus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus arizonicus plays an important role in its ecosystem by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plant life in the area."
