    "intro": "Leptochilus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows in dense clusters, with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, typically arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique growth form and ecological adaptations."
