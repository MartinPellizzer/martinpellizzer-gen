    "intro": "Lespedeza daurica f. prostrata, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features small, delicate pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its adaptability in various soil conditions. This plant is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
