    "intro": "Loranthus quequensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through the sugars it produces. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain small seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to regions of Asia, including China, and is often found in forested areas."
