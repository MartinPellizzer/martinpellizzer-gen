    "intro": "Leucas deflexa, commonly known as the slender leucas, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oblong fruits that are dispersed by wind. Leucas deflexa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
