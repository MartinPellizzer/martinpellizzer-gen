    "intro": "Leopoldia tabriziana, commonly known as the Tabriz leopoldia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and striking, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
