    "intro": "Libertia arundinacea, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically silvery-blue in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form dense clumps over time."
