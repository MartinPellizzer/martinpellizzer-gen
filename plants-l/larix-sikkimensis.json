    "intro": "Larix sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim larch, is a species of coniferous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for construction and paper production."
