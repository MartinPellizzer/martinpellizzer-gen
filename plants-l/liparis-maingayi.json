    "intro": "Liparis maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant's roots are often covered in a spongy, white tissue called velamen, which helps in absorbing moisture from the air."
