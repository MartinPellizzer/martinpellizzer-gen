    "intro": "Libertia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved libertia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems with showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
