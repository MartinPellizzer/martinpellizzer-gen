    "intro": "Loranthus thibetensis, commonly known as the Tibetan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited leaf structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. This species is found in the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan."
