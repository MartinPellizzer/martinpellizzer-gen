    "intro": "Lastrea scabrosa, commonly known as the rough lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with fleshy, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
