    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus var. divaricatus, commonly known as the variable broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. This variation of Lathyrus macrorrhizus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
