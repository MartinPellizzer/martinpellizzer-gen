    "intro": "Luehea herzogiana, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded canopy. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Luehea herzogiana is adapted to saline environments and often grows in coastal areas, playing a role in stabilizing shorelines."
