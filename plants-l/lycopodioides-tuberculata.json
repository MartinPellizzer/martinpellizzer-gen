It is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides tuberculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
