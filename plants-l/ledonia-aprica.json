    "intro": "Ledonia aprica, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
