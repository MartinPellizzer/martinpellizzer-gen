It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Lindernia trichotoma is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
