    "intro": "Lepanthes mephistopheles, commonly known as the Demon Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often dark-colored flowers that resemble miniature skulls, giving it its ominous common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small, with intricate patterns and a strong, sometimes unpleasant scent. Lepanthes mephistopheles is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and rarity in cultivation."
