    "intro": "Lysimachia kalalauensis, commonly known as the Kalalau lychee, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often found in forest understories on the island of Kauai. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
