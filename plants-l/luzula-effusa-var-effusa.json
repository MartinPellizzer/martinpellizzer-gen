    "intro": "Luzula effusa var. effusa, commonly known as the common wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate regions. Luzula effusa var. effusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats."
