It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in umbellate clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
