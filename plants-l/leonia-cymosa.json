    "intro": "Leonia cymosa, commonly known as the clustered leonias, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. Its foliage consists of ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth texture. Leonia cymosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
