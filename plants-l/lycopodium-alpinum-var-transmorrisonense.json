    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum var. transmorrisonense, commonly known as the Trans-Morrison clubmoss, is a rare variant of the clubmoss plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the tips of its stems, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
