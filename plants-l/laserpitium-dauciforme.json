    "intro": "Laserpitium dauciforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
