It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus columbianus var. simplex is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
