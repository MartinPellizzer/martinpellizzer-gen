It is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the humid lowlands of Central and South America. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with its leaves emerging from the base rather than the stem. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in warm, moist environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
