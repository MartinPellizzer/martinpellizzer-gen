    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lathyrus clymenenum var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, climbing vines with trifoliate leaves that are narrower and more elongated than those of the typical sweet pea. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
