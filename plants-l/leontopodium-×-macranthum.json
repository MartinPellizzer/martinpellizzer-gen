    "intro": "Leontopodium \u00d7 macranthum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a hybrid plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which consists of numerous small flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
