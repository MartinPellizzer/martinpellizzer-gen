    "intro": "Lycaste macrophylla subsp. panamanensis, commonly known as the Panama giant spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, with a distinctive yellow and purple coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its broad, strap-like leaves are adapted for efficient water retention, and it produces a single, fragrant flower spike per stem. This subspecies is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its rarity and beauty."
