    "intro": "Lycoris radiata f. bicolor, commonly known as the pink-red lycoris, is a striking variant of the common lycoris, characterized by its distinctive bicolor flowers. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that transition from a deep pink to a vibrant red as they open. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This ornamental plant is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
