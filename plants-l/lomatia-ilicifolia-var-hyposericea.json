    "intro": "Lomatia ilicifolia var. hyposericea, commonly known as the silky lomatia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
