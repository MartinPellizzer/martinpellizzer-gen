It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
