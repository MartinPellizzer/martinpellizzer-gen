    "intro": "Loxogramme dimorpha, commonly known as the common water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Loxogramme dimorpha plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
