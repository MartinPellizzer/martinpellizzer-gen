    "intro": "Lysimachia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp mouseear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
