It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
