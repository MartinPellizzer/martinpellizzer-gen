    "intro": "Leucophyllum laevigatum var. coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan shrub-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, woody structure and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and well-adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage is gray-green, with fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates."
