It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions."
