    "intro": "Leptoderris oxytropis, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, while its stems are woody and often branched. Leptoderris oxytropis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
