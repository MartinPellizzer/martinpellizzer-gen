    "intro": "Lindsaea scandens, commonly known as the climbing lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a perennial epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant features long, slender stems that allow it to climb and attach to tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps in water retention. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, followed by small, berry-like fruits."
