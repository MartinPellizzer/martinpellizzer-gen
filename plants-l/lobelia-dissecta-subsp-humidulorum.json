    "intro": "Lobelia dissecta subsp. humidulorum, commonly known as the wetland lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist habitats in North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or boggy soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other damp environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
