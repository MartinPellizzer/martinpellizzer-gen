    "intro": "Ligustrum tsoongii, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
