It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often hairy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blooms. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
