    "intro": "Litobrochia brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana lithobryum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows on damp, shaded rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive thallus structure with a flattened, green upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are well-developed and contribute to its reproductive strategy. Litobrochia brunoniana is often found in montane and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem dynamics."
