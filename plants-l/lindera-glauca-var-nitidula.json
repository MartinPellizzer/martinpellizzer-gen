    "intro": "Lindera glauca var. nitidula, commonly known as the glossy indigo bush, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in panicles. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
