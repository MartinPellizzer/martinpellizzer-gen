    "intro": "Limnia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous water flea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera. It is characterized by its transparent exoskeleton and a distinct, segmented body structure. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Limnia membranacea plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems as both a primary consumer and a food source for larger organisms. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
