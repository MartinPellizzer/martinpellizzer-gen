It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
