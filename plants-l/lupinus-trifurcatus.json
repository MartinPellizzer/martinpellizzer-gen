    "intro": "Lupinus trifurcatus, commonly known as the three-lobed lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus trifurcatus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
