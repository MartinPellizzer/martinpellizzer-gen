    "intro": "Lonicera crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Lonicera crassifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and floral display."
