    "intro": "Lithocardium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
