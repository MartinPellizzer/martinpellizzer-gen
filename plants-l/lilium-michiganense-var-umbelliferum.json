    "intro": "Lilium michiganense var. umbelliferum, commonly known as the Michigan lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the upper Midwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
