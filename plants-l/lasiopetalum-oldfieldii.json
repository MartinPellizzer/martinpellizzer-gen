    "intro": "Lasiopetalum oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's matted bellflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or mauve in color, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray. Lasiopetalum oldfieldii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
