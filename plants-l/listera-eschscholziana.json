    "intro": "Listera eschscholziana, commonly known as the alpine basketflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
