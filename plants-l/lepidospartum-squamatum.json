It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, scale-like leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Lepidospartum squamatum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
