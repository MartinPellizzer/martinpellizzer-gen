    "intro": "Laportea venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Laportea venosa is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
