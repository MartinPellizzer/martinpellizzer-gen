    "intro": "Lamium armenum subsp. sintenisii, commonly known as the Armenian dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Lamium species."
