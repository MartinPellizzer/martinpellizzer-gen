    "intro": "Leighia dissitifolia, commonly known as the orchid with the pink and white flowers, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that often feature a mix of pink and white petals. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses but remains relatively rare in the wild."
