    "intro": "Lachemilla ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it an ideal ground cover for woodland gardens. Lachemilla ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded, wet environments."
