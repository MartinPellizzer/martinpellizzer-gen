    "intro": "Loxogramme major, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water's surface, aiding in water filtration and oxygenation. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and form extensive underwater colonies. Loxogramme major plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
