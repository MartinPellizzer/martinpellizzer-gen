    "intro": "Loranthus cuernosensis, commonly known as the horned mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Loranthus cuernosensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
