    "intro": "Launaea fragilis subsp. fragilis, commonly known as the brittle dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
