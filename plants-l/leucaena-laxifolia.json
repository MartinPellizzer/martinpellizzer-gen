    "intro": "Leucaena laxifolia, commonly known as silverleaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often trifoliate. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Leucaena laxifolia is also valued for its fast growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
