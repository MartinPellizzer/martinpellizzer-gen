It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
