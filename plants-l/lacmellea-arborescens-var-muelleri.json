    "intro": "Lacmellea arborescens var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's tree moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort. It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth form, which is unusual for liverworts. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure with closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. This variety is notable for its ecological significance in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
