    "intro": "Libonia \u00d7 penrhosiensis, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Libonia rotundifolia and Libonia taurica, both of which are shrubs adapted to rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves and showy clusters of yellow or orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens and rockeries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to withstand salt spray and coastal winds."
