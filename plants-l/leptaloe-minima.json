    "intro": "Leptaloe minima, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small, flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
