    "intro": "Laportea oligoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are narrowly elliptic with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea oligoloba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
