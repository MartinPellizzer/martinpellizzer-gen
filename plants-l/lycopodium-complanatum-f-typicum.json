    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum f. typicum, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a fern ally belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, creeping plant with a prostrate growth habit, characterized by its narrow, linear leaves arranged in two rows. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its simple morphology and primitive structure make it an important species for studying the evolution of vascular plants."
