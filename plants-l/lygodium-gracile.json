    "intro": "Lygodium gracile, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, intricate structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Lygodium gracile is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens."
