    "intro": "Limonium supinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of many small, scale-like florets. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium supinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
