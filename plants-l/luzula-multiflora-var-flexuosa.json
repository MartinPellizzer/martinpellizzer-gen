    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves arranged in dense, tufted clusters. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. The species is characterized by its flexible, arching growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
