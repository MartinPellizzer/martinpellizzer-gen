    "intro": "Lotononis furcata, commonly known as the forked lotononis, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats."
