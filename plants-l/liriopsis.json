It consists of several species, most notably Liriopsis straminea, which is native to eastern North America. These plants are characterized by their delicate, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Liriopsis species are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
