    "intro": "Lasiagrostis alpina, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Lasiagrostis alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
