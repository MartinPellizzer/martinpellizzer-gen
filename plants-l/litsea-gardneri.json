    "intro": "Litsea gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's litsea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
