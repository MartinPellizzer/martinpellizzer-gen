    "intro": "Longetia buxoides, commonly known as the creeping boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscape design for its neat appearance and ability to tolerate pruning."
