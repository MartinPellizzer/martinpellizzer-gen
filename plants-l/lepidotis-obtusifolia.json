    "intro": "Lepidotis obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils. Lepidotis obtusifolia is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as roadsides and wetlands."
