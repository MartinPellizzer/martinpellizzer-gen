    "intro": "Liabum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Liabum fruticosum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to arid environments."
