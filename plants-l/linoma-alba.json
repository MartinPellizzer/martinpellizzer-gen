    "intro": "Linoma alba, commonly known as the white lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate and arctic regions. The plant exhibits a whitish or grayish color due to the presence of the algal component. Linoma alba is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its simple structure and slow growth make it an important subject in ecological studies."
