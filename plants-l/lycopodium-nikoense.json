    "intro": "Lycopodium nikoense, commonly known as the Nikoense clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems that produce whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Lycopodium nikoense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
