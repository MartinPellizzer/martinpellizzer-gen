It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Leschenaultia lutescens has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, oval fruits called cypselae. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
