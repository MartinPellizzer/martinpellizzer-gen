    "intro": "Lastrea illicita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, Lastrea illicita is of great interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
