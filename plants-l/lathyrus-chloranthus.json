    "intro": "Lathyrus chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from green to pale yellow. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along woodland edges. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
