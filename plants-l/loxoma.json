It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Loxoma species are herbaceous, with thin, fibrous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
