    "intro": "Loranthus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense clusters on the bark of various tree species."
