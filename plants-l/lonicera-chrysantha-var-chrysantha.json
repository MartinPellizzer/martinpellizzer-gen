It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
