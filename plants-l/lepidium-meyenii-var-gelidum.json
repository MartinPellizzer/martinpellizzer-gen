It is characterized by its branched, hairy stems and rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers and small, round seeds that are harvested for their nutritional and medicinal properties. Maca thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Its root system is the primary part used, containing compounds that contribute to its reputation as an adaptogen."
