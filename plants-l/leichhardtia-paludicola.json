    "intro": "Leichhardtia paludicola, commonly known as the marsh leichhardtia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with small, white or pale blue flowers that appear in clusters. It has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
