The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice among cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
