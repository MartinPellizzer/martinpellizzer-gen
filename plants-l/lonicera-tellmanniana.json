    "intro": "Lonicera tellmanniana, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a vigorous climber with opposite, ovate leaves and tubular, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It has a long blooming period and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and runners."
