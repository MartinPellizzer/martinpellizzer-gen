    "intro": "Litsea ilocana, commonly known as the Ilocano litsea or mountain pepper, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations above 1,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
