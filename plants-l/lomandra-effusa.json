    "intro": "Lomandra effusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in racemes. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Lomandra effusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
