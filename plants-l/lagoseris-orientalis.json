    "intro": "Lagoseris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sandmat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with bracts that are more showy than the actual blooms. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lagoseris orientalis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, temperate climates."
