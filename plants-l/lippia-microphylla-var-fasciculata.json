    "intro": "Lippia microphylla var. fasciculata, commonly known as creeping lippia, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and are often aromatic. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
