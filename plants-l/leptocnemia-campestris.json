    "intro": "Leptocnemia campestris, commonly known as the field leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, while the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. Leptocnemia campestris is valued for its edible leaves, which have a mild, onion-like flavor and are used in various culinary traditions."
