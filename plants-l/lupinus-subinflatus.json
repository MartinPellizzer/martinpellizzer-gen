    "intro": "Lupinus subinflatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and have a feathery appearance. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus subinflatus is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports ecological balance."
