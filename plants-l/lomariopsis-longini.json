    "intro": "Lomariopsis longini, commonly known as the long-stemmed lomariopsis, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Lomariopsis longini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
