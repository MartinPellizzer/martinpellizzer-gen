    "intro": "Leptospermum scandens, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and aromatic, often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. The plant is well adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
