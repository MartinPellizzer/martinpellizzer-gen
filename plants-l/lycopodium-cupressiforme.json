    "intro": "Lycopodium cupressiforme, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a resemblance to a small tree. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Lycopodium cupressiforme plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
