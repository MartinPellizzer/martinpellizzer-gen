    "intro": "Lagerstroemia parviflora subsp. napaulensis, commonly known as the Indian crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are dark green and turn red or orange in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, adding to its ornamental appeal."
