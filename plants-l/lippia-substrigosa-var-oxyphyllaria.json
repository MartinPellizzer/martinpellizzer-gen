It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a spice in local cuisines."
