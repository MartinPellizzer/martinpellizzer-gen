    "intro": "Lindsaea nervosa, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Lindsaea nervosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
