    "intro": "Lactuca raddeana var. aogashimaensis, commonly known as the Aogashima lettuce, is a rare and endemic species native to the Japanese island of Aogashima. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically succulent and fleshy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
