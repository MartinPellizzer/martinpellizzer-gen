    "intro": "Loranthus punctatus, commonly known as the dotterel or the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries. Loranthus punctatus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees in forests and woodlands."
