    "intro": "Lechea brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved lechea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Lechea brevifolia is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
