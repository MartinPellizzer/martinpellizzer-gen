    "intro": "Lindsaea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly lindsaea, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and aids in moisture retention. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Lindsaea lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
