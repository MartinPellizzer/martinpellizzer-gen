    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. loliaceum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it is often considered a problematic species in pasture and crop systems."
