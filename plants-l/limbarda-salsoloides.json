    "intro": "Limbarda salsoloides, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Limbarda salsoloides plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
