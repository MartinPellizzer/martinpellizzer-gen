    "intro": "Linaria triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Linaria triphylla is generally hardy and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
