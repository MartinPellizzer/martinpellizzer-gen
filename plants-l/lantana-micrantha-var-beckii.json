    "intro": "Lantana micrantha var. beckii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant has opposite, narrow, and usually hairy leaves that are often aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
