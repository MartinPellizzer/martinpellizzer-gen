    "intro": "Lobivia westii var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Lobivia, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and ribbed structure, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
