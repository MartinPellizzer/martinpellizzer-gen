    "intro": "Leptogramma centrochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese feather fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
