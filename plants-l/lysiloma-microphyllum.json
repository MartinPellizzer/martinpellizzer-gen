    "intro": "Lysiloma microphyllum, commonly known as the littleleaf acacia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs along a slender stem. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils."
