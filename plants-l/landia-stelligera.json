    "intro": "Landia stelligera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to sandy shores. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems, and it is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Landia stelligera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
