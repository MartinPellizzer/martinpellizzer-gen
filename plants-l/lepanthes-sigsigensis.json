    "intro": "Lepanthes sigsigensis, commonly known as the Sigsig orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Lepanthes sigsigensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
