The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with secondary pinnae that are often sub-bipinnate, contributing to its intricate foliage structure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
