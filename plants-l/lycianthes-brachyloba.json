It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green leaves and bears clusters of orange, lantern-like fruits that enclose the seeds. It is typically an annual or short-lived perennial, growing to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The fruits are often used in culinary applications, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental qualities."
