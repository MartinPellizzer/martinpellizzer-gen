    "intro": "Lobelia bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of blue and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lobelia bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
