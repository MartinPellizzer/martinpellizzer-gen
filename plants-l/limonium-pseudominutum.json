    "intro": "Limonium pseudominutum, commonly known as the dwarf sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Limonium pseudominutum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow in challenging coastal environments."
