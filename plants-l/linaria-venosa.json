    "intro": "Linaria venosa, commonly known as the zigzagged toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria venosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
