    "intro": "Lachemilla pascuorum, commonly known as the common cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, ascending stems that bear small, five-petaled yellow flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
