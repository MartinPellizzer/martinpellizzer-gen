    "intro": "Lotus tauricus, commonly known as the Taurian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe and western Asia. It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The Taurian lotus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it an important species for aquatic ecosystems."
