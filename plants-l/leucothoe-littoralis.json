    "intro": "Leucothoe littoralis, commonly known as the coastal leucothoe, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along the edges of forests and in rocky coastal areas. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
