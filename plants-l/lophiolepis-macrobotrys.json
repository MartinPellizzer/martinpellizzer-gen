    "intro": "Lophiolepis macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant spider-orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender sepals and petals. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded environment. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree trunks, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per inflorescence. Lophiolepis macrobotrys is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within the rainforest canopy."
