    "intro": "Lotus jacobaeus var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
