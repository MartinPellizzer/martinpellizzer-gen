It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, tubular flowers, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and produce small, oval-shaped seeds."
