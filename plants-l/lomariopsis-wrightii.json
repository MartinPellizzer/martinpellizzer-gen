    "intro": "Lomariopsis wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's lomariopsis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often display a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomariopsis wrightii is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
