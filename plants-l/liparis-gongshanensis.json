    "intro": "Liparis gongshanensis, commonly known as Gongshan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forest areas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its floral structure includes a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored, aiding in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis gongshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
