    "intro": "Lycopsis paui, commonly known as the Hawaiian lycopus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Lycopsis paui is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
