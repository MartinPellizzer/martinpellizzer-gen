    "intro": "Loranthus koenigianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds and aid in dispersal. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
