    "intro": "Leontodon crispatus, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or wavy at the edges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early summer, forming loose clusters at the tips of the stems. Leontodon crispatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
