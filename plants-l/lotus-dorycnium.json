    "intro": "Lotus dorycnium, commonly known as the broadleaf lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod fruits. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a broad, lobed structure, and its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a spurred petal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The seeds are enclosed in a tough, fibrous pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the environment."
