This variant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which contrast beautifully with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, producing tall, spindly stems covered in dense clusters of pea-like blooms. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
