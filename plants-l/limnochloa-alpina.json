    "intro": "Limnochloa alpina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Limnochloa alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
