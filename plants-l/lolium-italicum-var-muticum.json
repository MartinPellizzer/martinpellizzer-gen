    "intro": "Lolium italicum var. muticum, commonly known as the Italian ryegrass variant muticum, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. This variety is sometimes cultivated for forage but can also become a weed in agricultural settings."
