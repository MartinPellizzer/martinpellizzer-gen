    "intro": "Lomatium simplex var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slenderleaf lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
