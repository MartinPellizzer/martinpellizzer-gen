    "intro": "Lachnorhiza piloselloides, commonly known as the sticky lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate climates, forming a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant's thallus is usually dark green to blackish in color, with a sticky surface that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
