It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, with showy bracts that can be mistaken for petals.

It plays a role in both ecological systems and can be considered a weed in some environments."
