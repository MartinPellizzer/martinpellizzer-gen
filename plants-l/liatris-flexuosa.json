    "intro": "Liatris flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag blazingstar, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet prairies, meadows, and marshes, preferring full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often curling in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pink to purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
