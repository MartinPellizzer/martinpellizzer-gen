    "intro": "Lysimachia trientalis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant in the family Primulaceae. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
