    "intro": "Larrea divaricata var. arenaria, commonly known as desert whitethorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low moisture conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
