    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a horticultural form of the common vetch. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical green or purple blooms of the species. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and produces small, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
