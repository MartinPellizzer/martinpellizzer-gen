    "intro": "Lobelia kochiana, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lobelia kochiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
