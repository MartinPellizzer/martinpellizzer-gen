    "intro": "Leersia, commonly known as common leersia, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, often found in moist or wetland habitats. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered spikelets as inflorescences. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions. Leersia species are also important in ecological studies due to their role in wetland ecosystems."
