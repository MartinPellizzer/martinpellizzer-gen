    "intro": "Leptasea austromontana, commonly known as the southern mountain leptasea, is a rare and endemic species found in the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by dark blue berries that are a key food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
