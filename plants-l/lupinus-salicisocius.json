    "intro": "Lupinus salicisocius, commonly known as the willow-associated lupin, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus salicisocius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing near willow trees. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing plant, enhancing soil fertility in its habitat."
