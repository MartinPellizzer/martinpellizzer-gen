    "intro": "Lycopersicon agrimoniifolium, commonly known as the agrimonii leaf tomato, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed, agrimonii-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It is closely related to domesticated tomatoes but is often considered a wild relative. Due to its unique morphology and genetic potential, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders."
