    "intro": "Leandra erinacea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered leandra, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it relies on high humidity and partial sunlight. Its foliage consists of ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
