    "intro": "Ludia foetida, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a distinctive, somewhat succulent texture. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fruit ripens."
