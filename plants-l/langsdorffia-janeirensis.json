    "intro": "Langsdorffia janeirensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at protecting its dwindling population."
