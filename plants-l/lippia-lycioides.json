    "intro": "Lippia lycioides, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, four-petaled flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lippia lycioides is often used in traditional herbal remedies and has a distinct, minty aroma."
