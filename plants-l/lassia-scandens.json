    "intro": "Lassia scandens, commonly known as the climbing lassia, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lassia scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
