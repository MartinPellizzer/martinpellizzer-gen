It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats. Lupinus acopalcus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
