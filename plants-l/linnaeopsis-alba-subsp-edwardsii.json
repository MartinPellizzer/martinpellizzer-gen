    "intro": "Linnaeopsis alba subsp. edwardsii, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators and its role in wetland biodiversity."
