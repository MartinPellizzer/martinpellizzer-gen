    "intro": "Lindera subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-textured ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are rough to the touch, with a slightly hairy texture on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant foliage and seasonal interest."
