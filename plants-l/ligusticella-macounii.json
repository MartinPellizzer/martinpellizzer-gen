    "intro": "Ligusticella macounii, commonly known as Macoun's wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, fern-like leaves with a distinctive, slightly fuzzy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it produces tiny, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Ligusticella macounii is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
