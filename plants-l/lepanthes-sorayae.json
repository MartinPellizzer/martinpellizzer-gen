    "intro": "Lepanthes sorayae, commonly known as the Soraya's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes sorayae is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
