    "intro": "Lupinus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spires of blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which enhance soil fertility. Lupinus reticulatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
