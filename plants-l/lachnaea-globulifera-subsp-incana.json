It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant features hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
