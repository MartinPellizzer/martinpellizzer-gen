    "intro": "Linkia acerosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its root system is extensive and adapted to stabilize soil in rocky and sandy environments. Linkia acerosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscaping."
