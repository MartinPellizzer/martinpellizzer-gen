    "intro": "Lycopodium lucidulum var. occidentale, commonly known as the Western clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and distinctive club-shaped strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte structure is highly reduced, with the sporangia developing on the upper surface of the strobili. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
