    "intro": "Lilium lucidum, commonly known as the clear lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink petals and a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Lilium lucidum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
