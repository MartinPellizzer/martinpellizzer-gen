    "intro": "Linaria arvensis var. candollei, commonly known as the slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and bright yellow flowers with a distinctive bilateral symmetry. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing small, delicate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. This variant is distinguished from other Linaria species by its smaller size and specific floral morphology."
