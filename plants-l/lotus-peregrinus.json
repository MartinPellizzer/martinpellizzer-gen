    "intro": "Lotus peregrinus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Lotus peregrinus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are often associated with purity and spiritual significance in various cultures."
