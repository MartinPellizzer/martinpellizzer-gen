    "intro": "Lepanthes tamaensis, commonly known as the Tamaean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Lepanthes tamaensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
