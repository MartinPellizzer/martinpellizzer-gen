    "intro": "Lonicera verna, commonly known as the early twiner honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera verna is often found in moist, open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
