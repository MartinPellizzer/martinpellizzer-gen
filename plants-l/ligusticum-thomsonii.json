    "intro": "Ligusticum thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's angelica, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and are visited by various pollinators. The roots of Ligusticum thomsonii are also used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
