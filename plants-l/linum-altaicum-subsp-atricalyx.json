    "intro": "Linum altaicum subsp. atricalyx, commonly known as the black-fruited flax, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive black, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of Arctic flora."
