    "intro": "Lupinus alpestris var. argentatus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue or purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
