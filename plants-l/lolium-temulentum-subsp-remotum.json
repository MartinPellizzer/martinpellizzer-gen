It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in temperate regions."
