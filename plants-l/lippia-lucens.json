    "intro": "Lippia lucens, commonly known as the brightleaf lippia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Lippia lucens is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
