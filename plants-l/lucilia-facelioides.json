    "intro": "Lucilia facelioides, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive yellow-orange markings on its thorax. The plant is not a botanical entity but a fly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. This species is often found in environments with decaying organic matter, such as garbage or carrion. It plays a role in ecological decomposition and is sometimes used in forensic science to estimate time of death."
