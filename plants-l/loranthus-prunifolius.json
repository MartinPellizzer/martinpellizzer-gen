    "intro": "Loranthus prunifolius, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily those in the rose family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fruit and later excrete the seeds. Loranthus prunifolius is often found in forested areas and can be a common sight in regions with suitable host plants."
