    "intro": "Lemna abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf water shield, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length, with a waxy surface that helps it float. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems."
