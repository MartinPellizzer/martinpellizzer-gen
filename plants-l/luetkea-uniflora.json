    "intro": "Luetkea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures and a single, small flower that blooms at the water's surface. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
