    "intro": "Ligustrum argyi, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
