    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine regions."
