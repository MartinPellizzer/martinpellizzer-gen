    "intro": "Lygodium heterodoxum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its feathery, pinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in its native habitats."
