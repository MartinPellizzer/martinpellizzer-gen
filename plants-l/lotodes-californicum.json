    "intro": "Lotodes californicum, commonly known as the California water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. The roots of Lotodes californicum help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering out impurities."
