It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and curly, frilled leaves that give it its common name. It grows up to 30 cm tall and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Curly cress is also known for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
