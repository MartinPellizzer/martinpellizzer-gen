    "intro": "Limonium arabicum, commonly known as the desert lavender, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in summer. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Limonium arabicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
