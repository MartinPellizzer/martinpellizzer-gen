    "intro": "Lupinus hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, stiff, hairy leaflets, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus hirsutissimus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
