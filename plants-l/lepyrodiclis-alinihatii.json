It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
