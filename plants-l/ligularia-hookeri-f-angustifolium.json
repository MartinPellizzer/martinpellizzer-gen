It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent central vein. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens where it adds a dramatic visual impact."
