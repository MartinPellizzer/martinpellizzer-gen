    "intro": "Lamprocephalus, commonly known as the goldenhead orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. The genus is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a golden or yellow hue, which is a key identifying feature. Lamprocephalus species typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
