    "intro": "Leontopodium jacotianum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale green foliage and its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its unique morphology helps it retain heat and reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the Alps and is protected in many regions."
