    "intro": "Leucanthemum atratum subsp. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved oxeye daisy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and stem leaves that are narrower and gradually reduce in size upward. The plant produces showy white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of yellow tubular flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This species is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
