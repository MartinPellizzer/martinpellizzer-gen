    "intro": "Lepturus repens, commonly known as the creeping lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in cold climates. Lepturus repens is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
