    "intro": "Leucosidea, commonly known as the white thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, hairy stems and showy, composite flower heads that typically consist of both ray and disk flowers. Leucosidea species are native to various regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. They often grow in dry, rocky, or disturbed habitats, adapting to arid conditions with their deep root systems. The genus includes several species, such as *Leucosidea incana*, which is known for its silvery-gray foliage and ornamental value."
