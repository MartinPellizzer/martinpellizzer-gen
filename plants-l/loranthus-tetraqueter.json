    "intro": "Loranthus tetraqueter, commonly known as the four-branch mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in groups of four. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to regions of Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are abundant."
