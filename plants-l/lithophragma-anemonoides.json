    "intro": "Lithophragma anemonoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the top of its stem. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Lithophragma anemonoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler, humid conditions."
