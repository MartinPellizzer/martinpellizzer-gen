    "intro": "Lespedeza hirta var. longifolia, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered with short, stiff hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and finely toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and making it a valuable forage plant. It is also used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil."
