It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory ecosystems in its native habitat."
