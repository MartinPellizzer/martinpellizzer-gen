    "intro": "Lightfootia divaricata, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of white, green, and yellow. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lightfootia divaricata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
