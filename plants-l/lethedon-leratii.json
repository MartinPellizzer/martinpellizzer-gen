    "intro": "Lethedon leratii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lethe, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lethedon leratii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
