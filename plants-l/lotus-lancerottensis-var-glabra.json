    "intro": "Lotus lancerottensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean island of Lanzarote. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
