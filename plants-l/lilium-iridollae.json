    "intro": "Lilium iridollae, commonly known as the iridescent lily, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that display a unique iridescence, particularly under different light conditions. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces a single, tall stem that supports its vibrant, multi-colored blooms, making it a sought-after species in botanical gardens."
