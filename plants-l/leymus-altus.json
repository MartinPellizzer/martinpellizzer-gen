    "intro": "Leymus altus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Leymus altus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
