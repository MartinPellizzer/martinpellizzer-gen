    "intro": "Leptochilus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes rock orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a single, fleshy rhizome with a dense network of roots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical research and conservation."
