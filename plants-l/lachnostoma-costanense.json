    "intro": "Lachnostoma costanense, commonly known as the Costanese lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Lachnaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tight, often pale yellow to orange-brown coating on rock surfaces. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, typical of lichen morphology. It is typically found in Mediterranean climates, growing on limestone and sandstone substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
