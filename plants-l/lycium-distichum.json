    "intro": "Lycium distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stems. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for heat and drought. Lycium distichum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
