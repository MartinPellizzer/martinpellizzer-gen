    "intro": "Ligustrum \u00d7 vicaryi, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to China. It features opposite, simple, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, drupaceous berries. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
