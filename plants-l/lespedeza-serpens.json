    "intro": "Lespedeza serpens, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, fluffy, yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and linear, with a hairy texture. Lespedeza serpens is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
