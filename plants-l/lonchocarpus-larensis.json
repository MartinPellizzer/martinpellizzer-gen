    "intro": "Lonchocarpus larensis, commonly known as the Larensis legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and its flowers are typically clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods, which contribute to its ecological role in soil enrichment. Due to its potential toxicity, it is often avoided for agricultural use but remains an important species in ecological studies."
