    "intro": "Liabum arthrothrix, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its distinctive appearance and relatively low maintenance, Liabum arthrothrix is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
