    "intro": "Limacia selwynii, commonly known as the Selwyn's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Limacia selwynii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
