It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with hairy, opposite leaves that have a distinctive mint-like scent. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.
