    "intro": "Lobelia kerneri, commonly known as the Sierra lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
