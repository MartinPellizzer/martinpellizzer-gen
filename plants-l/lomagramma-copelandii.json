    "intro": "Lomagramma copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's lomagramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that often display a striking green to bronze hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks, where it can access the necessary humidity and light. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomagramma copelandii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
