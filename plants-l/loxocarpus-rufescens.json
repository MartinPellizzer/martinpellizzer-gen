    "intro": "Loxocarpus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed everlet, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Loxocarpus rufescens is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
