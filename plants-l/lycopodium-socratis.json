    "intro": "Lycopodium socratis, commonly known as the Socratis clubmoss, is a species of small evergreen plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its production of spore-bearing cones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its dense, moss-like appearance. Lycopodium socratis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
