It features cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
