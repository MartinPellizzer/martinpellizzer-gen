    "intro": "Lycianthes parasitica subsp. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically has small, green leaves and produces yellow or white flowers. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. It is native to Central and South America and is often found growing on trees or shrubs."
