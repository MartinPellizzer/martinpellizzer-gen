    "intro": "Leptospermum divaricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that are fragrant and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
