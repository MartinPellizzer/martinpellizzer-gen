    "intro": "Leea mastersii, commonly known as the whiteleaf leea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually glossy and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
