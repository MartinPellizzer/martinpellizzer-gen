It features small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils in full sun."
