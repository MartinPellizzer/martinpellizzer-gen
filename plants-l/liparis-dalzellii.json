    "intro": "Liparis dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis dalzellii is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
