    "intro": "Lobaria cernua, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, dark green to blackish thallus with a distinctive, velvety texture. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, especially in moist, shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. The plant's structure includes a lower cortex, medulla, and upper cortex, with the algal layer located in the upper part of the thallus."
