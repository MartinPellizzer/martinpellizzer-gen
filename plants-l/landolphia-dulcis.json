    "intro": "Landolphia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet-scented nightshade, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are yellow when ripe, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
