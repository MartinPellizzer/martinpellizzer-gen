    "intro": "Lagenophora lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is closely related to the hevea brasiliensis, another rubber-producing species. Its latex contains natural rubber and has traditional medicinal uses. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
