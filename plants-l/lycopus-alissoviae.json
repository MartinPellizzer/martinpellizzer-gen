It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Lycopus alissoviae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
