    "intro": "Lethea trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded lethea, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, ribbed, seed-containing capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
