    "intro": "Lophophora echinata var. typica, commonly known as the peyote cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, rounded stems that often develop a blue-green hue when mature. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is known for containing the psychoactive compound mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous cultures. Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is protected in many regions and requires special permits for cultivation or collection."
