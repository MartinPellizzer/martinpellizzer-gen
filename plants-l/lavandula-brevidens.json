    "intro": "Lavandula brevidens, commonly known as narrow-leaved lavender, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, narrow, linear leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. This species is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value. The plant's essential oils, derived from its flowers, are valued in aromatherapy and perfumery."
