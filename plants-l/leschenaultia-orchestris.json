    "intro": "Leschenaultia orchestris, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features basal leaves that are silver-gray in color due to dense pubescence, while the upper leaves are narrower and less hairy. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. Leschenaultia orchestris is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
