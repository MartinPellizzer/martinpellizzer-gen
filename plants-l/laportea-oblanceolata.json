    "intro": "Laportea oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage has a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Laportea oblanceolata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade."
