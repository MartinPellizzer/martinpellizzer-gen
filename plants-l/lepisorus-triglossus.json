    "intro": "Lepisorus triglossus, commonly known as the three-leaf moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. Lepisorus triglossus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
