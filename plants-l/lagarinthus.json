    "intro": "Lagarinthus, commonly known as the \"flowering grass\" or \"blue mist shrub,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. The plants are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit and their clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. Lagarinthus species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous fruits. They are often grown as ornamental plants for their attractive, long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
