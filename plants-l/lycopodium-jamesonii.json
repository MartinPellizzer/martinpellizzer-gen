    "intro": "Lycopodium jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing strobila, or cones, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium jamesonii thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
