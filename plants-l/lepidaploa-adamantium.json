    "intro": "Lepidaploa adamantium, commonly known as the hardy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, overlapping scales that give it its genus name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Lepidaploa adamantium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
