    "intro": "Lupinus benthamii var. benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's lupin, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus benthamii var. benthamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
