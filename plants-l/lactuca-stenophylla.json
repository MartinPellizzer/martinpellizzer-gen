    "intro": "Lactuca stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lactuca stenophylla is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is not commonly cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
