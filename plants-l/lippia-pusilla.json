    "intro": "Lippia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf lippia, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lippia pusilla is often found in shaded, moist environments like forest understories or along stream banks. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses."
