    "intro": "Leucaena, commonly known as screwbean, is a genus of leguminous plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It consists of several species, with *Leucaena leucocephala* being the most widely cultivated. These plants are characterized by their bipinnate leaves, small white or yellow flowers, and pods that contain edible seeds. They are often used for forage, soil nitrogen fixation, and as a source of timber. Leucaena species are also valued for their ability to thrive in poor soils and their rapid growth rate."
