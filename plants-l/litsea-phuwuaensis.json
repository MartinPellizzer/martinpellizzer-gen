    "intro": "Litsea phuwuaensis, commonly known as the Phuwua-laurel, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, dark purple berries. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
