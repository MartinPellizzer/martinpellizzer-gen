    "intro": "Labatia ramiflora, commonly known as the branching-flowered labatia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a fibrous root system and erect, often branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Labatia ramiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
