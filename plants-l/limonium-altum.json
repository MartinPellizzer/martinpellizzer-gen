    "intro": "Limonium altum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves, which help it retain moisture in saline environments. Limonium altum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it a hardy and ornamental addition to maritime landscapes."
