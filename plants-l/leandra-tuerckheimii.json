    "intro": "Leandra tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's leandra, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, it is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom during the wet season. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
