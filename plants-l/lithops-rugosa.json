    "intro": "Lithops rugosa, commonly known as the \"dune lithops,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. Lithops rugosa is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
