It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lupinus tancitaricus is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
