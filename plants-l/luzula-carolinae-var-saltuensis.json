    "intro": "Luzula carolinae var. saltuensis, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along salt marshes and tidal flats, showcasing its adaptability to saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy, with a robust root system that helps it withstand periodic flooding. It produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
