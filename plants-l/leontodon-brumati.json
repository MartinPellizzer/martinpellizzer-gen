    "intro": "Leontodon brumati, commonly known as the winter dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants of the year. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold conditions."
