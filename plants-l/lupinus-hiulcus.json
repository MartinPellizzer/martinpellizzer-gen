It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus hulcus is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
