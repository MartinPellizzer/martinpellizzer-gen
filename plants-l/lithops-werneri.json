    "intro": "Lithops werneri, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, allowing it to blend seamlessly with its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, which are typically green with subtle markings that mimic rock patterns. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the winter months, adding a striking contrast to its stone-like appearance. Lithops werneri is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant for cultivation."
