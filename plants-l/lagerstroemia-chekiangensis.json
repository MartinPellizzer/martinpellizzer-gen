    "intro": "Lagerstroemia chekiangensis, commonly known as the Chinese crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that appear in late summer, giving the plant its ornamental appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. The flowers are not true flowers but modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals."
