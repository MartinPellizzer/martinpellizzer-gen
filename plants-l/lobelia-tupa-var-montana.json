    "intro": "Lobelia tupa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lobelia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Lobelia tupa var. montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
