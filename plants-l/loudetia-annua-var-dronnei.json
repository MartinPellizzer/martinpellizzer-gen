It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
