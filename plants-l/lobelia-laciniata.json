    "intro": "Lobelia laciniata, commonly known as the slitscale lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland gardens and stream banks. Lobelia laciniata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
