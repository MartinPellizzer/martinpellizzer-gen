It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Lophocereus schottii is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
