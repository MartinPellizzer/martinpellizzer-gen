    "intro": "Laportea sinuata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters tall. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive wavy margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Laportea sinuata is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas."
