It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. The plant has a pale to dark green or brown coloration, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It lacks distinct lobes and has a simple, elongated structure. This variety is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is relatively uncommon in most regions."
