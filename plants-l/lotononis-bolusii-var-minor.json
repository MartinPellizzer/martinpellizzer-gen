    "intro": "Lotononis bolusii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf lotononis, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is gaining popularity among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
