    "intro": "Leptodermis pilosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy skin vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and slender, climbing stems that often twine around supporting structures. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which bloom throughout the wet season. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
