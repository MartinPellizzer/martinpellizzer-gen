It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, twisted leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its ecological value includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
