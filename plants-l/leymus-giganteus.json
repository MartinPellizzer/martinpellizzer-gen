    "intro": "Leymus giganteus, commonly known as giant alkali sacaton, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets in summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its robust growth makes it a key species in ecological restoration projects."
