    "intro": "Lumnitzera pedicellata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It thrives in brackish and saline water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has pneumatophores, specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by edible, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various wildlife. Lumnitzera pedicellata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal areas and supporting biodiversity in tropical wetlands."
