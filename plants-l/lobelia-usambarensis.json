    "intro": "Lobelia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara lobe, is a flowering plant native to the East African mountains, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Lobelia usambarensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
