    "intro": "Lonchocarpus mutans, commonly known as the variable legume, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its striking yellow flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. However, some parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous if not handled properly."
