    "intro": "Lachemilla frigida, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Lachemilla frigida is valued for its hardiness and ability to add color to harsh, inhospitable landscapes."
