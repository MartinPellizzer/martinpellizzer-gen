    "intro": "Lindsaea dolabra, commonly known as the broad-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants with specialized water-storing structures. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Lindsaea dolabra typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as spore-bearing capsules, are located at the tips of its leaf-like bracts."
