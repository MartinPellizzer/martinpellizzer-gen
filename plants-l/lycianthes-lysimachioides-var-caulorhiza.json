    "intro": "Lycianthes lysimachioides var. caulorhiza, commonly known as the purpleleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive purplish hue. The plant produces small, white to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, yellowish fruits. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution in handling."
