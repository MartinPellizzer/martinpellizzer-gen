    "intro": "Lotodes pinnatum, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lotodes, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically green and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. The flowers are usually white or pink and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
