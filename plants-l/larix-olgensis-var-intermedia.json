    "intro": "Larix olgensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It typically grows in cold, boreal climates and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
