    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. rosarioana, commonly known as the Rosarioana Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
