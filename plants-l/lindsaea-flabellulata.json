    "intro": "Lindsaea flabellulata, commonly known as the fan-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, umbrella-like clusters called sorus. Lindsaea flabellulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
