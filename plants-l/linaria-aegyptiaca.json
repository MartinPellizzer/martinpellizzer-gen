    "intro": "Linaria aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian toadflax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in the shape of a spurred tail, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. Linaria aegyptiaca is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
