    "intro": "Lasianthera amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
