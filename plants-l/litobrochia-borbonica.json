    "intro": "Litobrochia borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon litobrochia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the island of R\u00e9union. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and humid environments, often found in coastal areas or on limestone substrates. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Litobrochia borbonica is considered a vulnerable species."
