    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. pluricostata, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Dead,\" is a rare and striking cacti species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color, with a unique, flattened shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
