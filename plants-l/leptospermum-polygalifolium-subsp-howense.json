It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
