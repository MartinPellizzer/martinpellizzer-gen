    "intro": "Ledum maximum, commonly known as Labrador tea, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems contain aromatic oils, which contribute to its strong, minty scent. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful use."
