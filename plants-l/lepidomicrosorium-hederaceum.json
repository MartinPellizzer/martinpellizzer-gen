    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium hederaceum, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that resemble moss. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a dense arrangement of tiny, scale-like structures on the underside. Lepidomicrosorium hederaceum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
