    "intro": "Lilium brownii var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaf lily, is a rare and beautiful species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
