    "intro": "Lithops karasmontana var. lericheana, commonly known as the Karas Mountains lithops, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are typically gray-green with distinct markings that help with camouflage. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
