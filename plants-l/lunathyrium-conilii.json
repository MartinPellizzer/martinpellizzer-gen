    "intro": "Lunathyrium conilii, commonly known as the Canary Island dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
