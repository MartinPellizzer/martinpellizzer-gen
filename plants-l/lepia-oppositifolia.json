    "intro": "Lepia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, opposite leaves that provide a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Lepia oppositifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
