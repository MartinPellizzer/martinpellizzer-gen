    "intro": "Lindsaea bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, needle-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea bilobata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
