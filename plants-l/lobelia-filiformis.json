    "intro": "Lobelia filiformis, commonly known as slender lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Lobelia filiformis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
