    "intro": "Loranthus terminaliflorus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous. Its fruits are typically berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by birds. This species is found in various regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates."
