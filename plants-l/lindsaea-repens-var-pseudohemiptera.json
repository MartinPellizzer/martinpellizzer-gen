    "intro": "Lindsaea repens var. pseudohemiptera, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground and produce clusters of small, linear leaves. The plant features fertile fronds that bear spore-producing structures called sori, typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where high humidity supports its growth. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures, making it a notable species within the Lindsaea genus."
