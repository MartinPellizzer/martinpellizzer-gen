    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, broad elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
