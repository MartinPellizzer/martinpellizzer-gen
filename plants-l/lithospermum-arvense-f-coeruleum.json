It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is notable for its striking blue flower color, which distinguishes it from other members of the species."
