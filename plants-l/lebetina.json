    "intro": "Lebetina, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny areas and is found across various regions of North America. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive hooded structure. Lebetina plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
