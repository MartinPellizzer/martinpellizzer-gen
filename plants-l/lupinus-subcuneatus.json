    "intro": "Lupinus subcuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-angled lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spicate inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which are typical of many lupine species. Lupinus subcuneatus has deep taproots that help it thrive in well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
