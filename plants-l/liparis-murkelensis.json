    "intro": "Liparis murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, creeping rhizome and a rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
