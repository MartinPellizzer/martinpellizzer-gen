It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Lupinus nanus var. vallicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
