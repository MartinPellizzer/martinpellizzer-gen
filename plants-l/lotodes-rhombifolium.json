    "intro": "Lotodes rhombifolium, commonly known as the rhombic water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its broad, rhomboid-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrates of still or slow-moving water bodies. Lotodes rhombifolium plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
