It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Leucophae pumila is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
