    "intro": "Leptocladodia viperina, commonly known as the viper's tongue lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It consists of a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a cyanobacterial partner and a fungal partner, which contributes to its unique morphology and ecological role. It often grows on bare rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually divided into lobes, which give it a leaf-like appearance, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves."
