    "intro": "Lithocardium oaxacanum, commonly known as the Oaxacan lithocardium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in forested or shrubland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lithocardium oaxacanum is considered a species of conservation concern."
