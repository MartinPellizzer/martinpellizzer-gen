    "intro": "Ligularia cacaliiformis, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
