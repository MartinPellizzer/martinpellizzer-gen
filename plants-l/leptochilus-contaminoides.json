    "intro": "Leptochilus contaminoides, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. Leptochilus contaminoides is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
