    "intro": "Lysinema ovatum, commonly known as the clustered tamarack, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Lysinema ovatum is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and stream valleys."
