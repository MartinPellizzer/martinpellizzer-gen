    "intro": "Lundellianthus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan lundellia, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Guatemala. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a shrub-like structure with woody stems. Its flowers are often pink or red, and they bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
