    "intro": "Lilium bukosanense, commonly known as the Bukosan lily, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions of its natural habitat. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival during periods of dormancy, allowing it to withstand seasonal changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium bukosanense is considered a conservation concern."
