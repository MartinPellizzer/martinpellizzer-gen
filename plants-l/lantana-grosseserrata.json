    "intro": "Lantana grosseserrata, commonly known as the roughleaf lantana, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
