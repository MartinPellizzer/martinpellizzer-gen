    "intro": "Lomandra sericea, commonly known as the silky lomandra, is a perennial evergreen herb native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, typically in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Lomandra sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Indigenous medicine."
