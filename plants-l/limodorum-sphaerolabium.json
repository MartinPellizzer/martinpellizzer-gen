    "intro": "Limodorum sphaerolabium, commonly known as the globe lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, rounded flower spike that bears several showy, white to pale pink blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
