    "intro": "Lappa lappa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic plant belonging to the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It is found in wetlands and along stream banks in North America and parts of Europe. Due to its highly poisonous nature, it should never be ingested or handled without proper protection."
