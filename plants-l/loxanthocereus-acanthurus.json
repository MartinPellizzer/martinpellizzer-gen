    "intro": "Loxanthocereus acanthurus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive yellowish-green stem and a crown of spines that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from brief rainfall events. Loxanthocereus acanthurus is well-suited to desert environments and requires minimal water once established."
