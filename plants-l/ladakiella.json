    "intro": "Ladakiella, commonly known as the mountain hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. The plants are shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. They produce showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and small mammals."
