    "intro": "Lobivia otukae, commonly known as the Otuka's lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lobivia otukae is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking addition to rock gardens and arid landscapes."
