    "intro": "Liparis bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, leafy stems that bear linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Liparis bidentata is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
