    "intro": "Lupinus aridorum, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Lupinus aridorum is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
