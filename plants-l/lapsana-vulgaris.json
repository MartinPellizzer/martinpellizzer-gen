It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Lapsana vulgaris is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
