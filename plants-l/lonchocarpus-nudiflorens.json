It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many leguminous plants characterized by their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is notable for its distinctive, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom directly from the stem, lacking leafy bracts. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain edible seeds. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
