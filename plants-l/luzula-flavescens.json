    "intro": "Luzula flavescens, commonly known as yellow woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, low-growing mats. Luzula flavescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
