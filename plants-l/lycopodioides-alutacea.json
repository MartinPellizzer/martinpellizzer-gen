    "intro": "Lycopodioides alutacea, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common among primitive vascular plants. Lycopodioides alutacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
