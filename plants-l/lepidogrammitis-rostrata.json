    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lepidogrammitis rostrata is a relatively rare species, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth."
