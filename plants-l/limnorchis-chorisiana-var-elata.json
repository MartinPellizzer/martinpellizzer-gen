    "intro": "Limnorchis chorisiana var. elata, commonly known as the tall marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes, swamps, or along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, bearing showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
