It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sandy soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
