    "intro": "Lonicera mollissima, commonly known as the velvet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Lonicera mollissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
