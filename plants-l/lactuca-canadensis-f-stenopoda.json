It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically more upright than those of the standard variety. This form is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other lettuces and wild relatives."
