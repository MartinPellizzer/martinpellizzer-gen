It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a cluster of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
