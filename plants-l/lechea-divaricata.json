    "intro": "Lechea divaricata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Lechea divaricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
