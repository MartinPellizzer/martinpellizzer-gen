    "intro": "Lycopodium nanchuanense, commonly known as the Nanchuan clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of lycophyte native to China. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and dimorphic sporophylls. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its small, scale-like leaves and unique reproductive structures make it an important subject in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
