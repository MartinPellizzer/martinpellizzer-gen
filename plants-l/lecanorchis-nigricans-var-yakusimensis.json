    "intro": "Lecanorchis nigricans var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island, Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or among moss-covered rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
