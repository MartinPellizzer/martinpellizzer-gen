It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with whorled leaves and a branching, club-like structure at the top. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are located at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium centrochinense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
