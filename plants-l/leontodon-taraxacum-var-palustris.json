    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
