    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. albiloba, commonly known as the white-flowered twinleaf, is a rare variant of the twinleaf plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a delicate, waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters of two, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral coloration and its role in ecological studies of alpine and boreal ecosystems."
