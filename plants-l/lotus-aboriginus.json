    "intro": "Lotus aboriginus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-living plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots grow submerged in the mud, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. The lotus is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
