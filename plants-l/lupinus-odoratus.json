    "intro": "Lupinus odoratus, commonly known as the fragrant lupin, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lupinus odoratus thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for coastal and arid regions. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable plant for gardens and restoration projects."
