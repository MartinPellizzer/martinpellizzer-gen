    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus var. carniolicus, commonly known as the Carniolan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
