    "intro": "Limnia utahensis, commonly known as the Utah fairy shrimp, is a small crustacean that thrives in temporary freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its translucent, segmented body and is often found in isolated pools and vernal pools. This species plays a vital role in its ecosystem by serving as a food source for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Limnia utahensis is adapted to rapid life cycles, completing its development before the temporary water bodies dry up. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
