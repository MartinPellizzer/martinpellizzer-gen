    "intro": "Lycopodium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, needle-like leaves that are often a bluish-green in color. It produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, a characteristic feature of lycophytes. Lycopodium glaucescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
