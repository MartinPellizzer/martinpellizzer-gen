    "intro": "Leschenaultia pallescens var. congesta, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
