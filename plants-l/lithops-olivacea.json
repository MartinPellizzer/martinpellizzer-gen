    "intro": "Lithops olivacea, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, which helps it blend into its arid environment. The plant has two fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or grayish tint, often featuring white or yellowish markings. Lithops olivacea stores water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It blooms with small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months."
