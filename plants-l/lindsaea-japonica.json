    "intro": "Lindsaea japonica, commonly known as the Japanese lindsaea, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Lindsaea japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
