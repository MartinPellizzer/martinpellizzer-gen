    "intro": "Lygodium circinnatum var. denticulatum, commonly known as the denticulate water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and swamps. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The varietal name \"denticulatum\" refers to the finely toothed margins of its fronds, a distinctive botanical feature."
