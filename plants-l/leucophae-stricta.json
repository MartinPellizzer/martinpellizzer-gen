    "intro": "Leucophae stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitebark, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
