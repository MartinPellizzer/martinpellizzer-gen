    "intro": "Lacosteopsis orientalis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf lacosteopsis, is a rare and compact variant of the lacosteopsis genus. It is characterized by its short, dense growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty plant growers."
