    "intro": "Loreya trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are usually oval and slightly hairy, while the fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and studied for its botanical significance."
