    "intro": "Ledebouria burkei subsp. stolonissima, commonly known as the Stoloniferous Ledebouria, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, linear leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through runners. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
