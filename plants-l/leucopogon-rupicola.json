    "intro": "Leucopogon rupicola, commonly known as the rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant typically grows on rocky or sandy soils in coastal and inland dunes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Leucopogon rupicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor nutrient conditions."
