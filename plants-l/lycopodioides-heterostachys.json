It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with a short, thick stem and whorled leaves that are often scale-like. Its reproductive structures, called strobili, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores. Lycopodioides heterostachys plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
