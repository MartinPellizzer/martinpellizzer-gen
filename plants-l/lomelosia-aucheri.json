    "intro": "Lomelosia aucheri, commonly known as the Persian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to blue, often with a striking white or yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early summer."
