    "intro": "Leucophyllum laevigatum var. laevigatum, commonly known as Texas betony, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular, violet to blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. The plant has silver-green, narrow, and slightly fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in dry climates."
