    "intro": "Lycopodium casuarinoides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
