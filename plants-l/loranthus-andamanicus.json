    "intro": "Loranthus andamanicus, commonly known as the Andaman mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the Andaman Islands. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellow flowers that are often visited by insects. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife."
