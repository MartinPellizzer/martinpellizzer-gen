    "intro": "Lithops eberlanzii var. eberlanzii, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features two closely fused, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, rounded leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Lithops eberlanzii var. eberlanzii requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive."
