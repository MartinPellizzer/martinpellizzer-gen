    "intro": "Lolium bromoides, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Lolium bromoides is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value."
