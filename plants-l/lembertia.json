    "intro": "Lembertia, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent leaves and bark. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Lembertia species are valued for their medicinal properties and are used in traditional African medicine. They also play an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
