    "intro": "Lepanthes erubescens, commonly known as the red-bellied orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers with yellow markings, which are often borne on slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a raceme, and it produces small, greenish berries that contain the seeds. Lepanthes erubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant color and unique appearance."
