    "intro": "Lemna paucicostata var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant exhibits a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped with a waxy, membranous surface that aids in buoyancy. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor water quality."
