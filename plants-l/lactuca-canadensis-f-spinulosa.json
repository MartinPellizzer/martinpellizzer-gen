    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis f. spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a bitter taste, while the flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters. This form is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
