    "intro": "Lacistema pedicellatum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
