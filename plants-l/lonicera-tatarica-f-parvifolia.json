It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically appearing in late spring. Its small, red berries are edible and attract birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of garden conditions."
