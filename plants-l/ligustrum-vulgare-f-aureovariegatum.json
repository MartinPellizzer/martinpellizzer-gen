    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. aureovariegatum, commonly known as the golden variegated privet, is a cultivar of the common privet. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display yellow and white patterns against a backdrop of dark green. This plant is a compact shrub with small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production in the leaves. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
