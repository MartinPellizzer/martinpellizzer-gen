    "intro": "Launaea longiloba, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water. Its yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Launaea longiloba is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can enter dormancy during prolonged droughts."
