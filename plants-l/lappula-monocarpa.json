    "intro": "Lappula monocarpa, commonly known as the single-seeded lappula, is a flowering plant in the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, elongated seed capsule that contains a single, winged seed. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
