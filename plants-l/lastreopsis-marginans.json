    "intro": "Lastreopsis marginans, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Lastreopsis marginans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
