    "intro": "Lessertia herbacea, commonly known as the dwarf lilyturf, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in native plant landscaping."
