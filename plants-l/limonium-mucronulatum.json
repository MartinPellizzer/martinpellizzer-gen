    "intro": "Limonium mucronulatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Limonium mucronulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
