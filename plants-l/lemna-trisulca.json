    "intro": "Lemna trisulca, commonly known as the three-lobed duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically divided into three distinct lobes. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming from the nodes along its stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
