    "intro": "Lonicera humilis, commonly known as the trailing honeysuckle, is a deciduous flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or climbing growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, followed by red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are edible for birds. Lonicera humilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common sight in natural and cultivated landscapes."
