    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that can form dense mats, with small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
