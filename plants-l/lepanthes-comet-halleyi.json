    "intro": "Lepanthes comet-halleyi, commonly known as the Halley's Comet Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns resembling the comet's tail. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its blooming period coincides with the appearance of Halley's Comet, which is why it was given its unique name. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
