    "intro": "Listera multinervia, commonly known as the broad-leaved basketflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, dark berries that are eaten by various bird species. Listera multinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
