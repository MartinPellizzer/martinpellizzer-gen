    "intro": "Limosella inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the family Halocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on water surfaces. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limosella inflata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
