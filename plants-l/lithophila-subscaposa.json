    "intro": "Lithophila subscaposa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and well-drained soils, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in crevices. Lithophila subscaposa is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
