    "intro": "Lagopus pratensis, commonly known as the purple moorgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in peat bogs, heaths, and other wetland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Lagopus pratensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
