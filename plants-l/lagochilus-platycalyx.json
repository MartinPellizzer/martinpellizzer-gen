    "intro": "Lagochilus platycalyx, commonly known as the broad-calyx rock rose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a grayish-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Lagochilus platycalyx is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
