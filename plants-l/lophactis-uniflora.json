    "intro": "Lophactis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lophactis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophactis uniflora is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
