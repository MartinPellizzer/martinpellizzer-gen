    "intro": "Loranthus praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Rosaceae and Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense canopies where it can receive sufficient light for its limited photosynthetic activity."
