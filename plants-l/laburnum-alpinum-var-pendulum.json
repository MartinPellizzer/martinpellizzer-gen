    "intro": "Laburnum alpinum var. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the Alps. It is characterized by its long, pendulous yellow flower clusters that hang from the branches, creating a striking visual display in spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks. Due to its toxicity, it should be planted with care, especially in areas accessible to children and pets."
