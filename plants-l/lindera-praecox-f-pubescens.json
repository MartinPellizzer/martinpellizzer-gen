    "intro": "Lindera praecox f. pubescens, commonly known as the early lindera or hairy lindera, is a variant of the early lindera, a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring before the leaves fully expand. The fruits are small, dark berries that develop in late summer. This form is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a more rugged appearance compared to the typical form."
