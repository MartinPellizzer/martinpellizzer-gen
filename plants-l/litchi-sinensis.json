    "intro": "Litchi sinensis, commonly known as the lychee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China. It produces small, hairy, red fruits with a single seed enclosed in a white, opaque pulp. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often appearing before the fruit develops. The botanical significance of Litchi sinensis lies in its unique morphology and its role in traditional horticulture."
