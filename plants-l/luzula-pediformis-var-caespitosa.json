    "intro": "Luzula pediformis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in compact clumps. Luzula pediformis var. caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
