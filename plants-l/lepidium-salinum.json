    "intro": "Lepidium salinum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Sea rocket is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
