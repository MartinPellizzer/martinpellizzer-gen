    "intro": "Lupinus fieldii, commonly known as the Great Basin lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with thread-like leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus fieldii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species."
