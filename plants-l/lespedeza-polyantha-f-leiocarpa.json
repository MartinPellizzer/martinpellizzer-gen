The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration."
