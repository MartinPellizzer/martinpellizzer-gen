    "intro": "Lebetanthus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andes region, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow or orange flowers. They have adapted to poor soils and high altitudes, making them resilient in harsh environments. Lebetanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
