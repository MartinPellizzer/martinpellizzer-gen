    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable twinflower, is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Eurasia. The plant is characterized by its unique morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and size, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Linnaea borealis. Its small, bell-shaped white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to the forest floor. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological diversity."
