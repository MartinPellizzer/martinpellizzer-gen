    "intro": "Lastrea weberi, commonly known as Weber's lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Lastrea weberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
