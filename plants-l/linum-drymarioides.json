    "intro": "Linum drymarioides, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Linum drymarioides is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
