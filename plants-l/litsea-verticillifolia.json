    "intro": "Litsea verticillifolia, commonly known as the fragrant evergreen tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves that emit a distinctive citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Litsea verticillifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
