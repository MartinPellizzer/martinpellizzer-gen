    "intro": "Lycianthes starbuckii, commonly known as the starbuck's physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions of Mexico and Central America. The plant produces small, inflated calyces that enclose its orange-red berries, which are often mistaken for tomatoes. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Lycianthes starbuckii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
