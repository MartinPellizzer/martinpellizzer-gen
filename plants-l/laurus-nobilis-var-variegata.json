    "intro": "Laurus nobilis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated laurel, is a cultivar of the bay laurel plant. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, yellow, and green. This plant is evergreen, with a dense, aromatic foliage that emits a strong, spicy scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique appearance."
