    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. differens, commonly known as the variable flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
