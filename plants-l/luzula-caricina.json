    "intro": "Luzula caricina, commonly known as the common wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a triangular cross-section. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets and bloom in early spring. Luzula caricina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life."
