    "intro": "Lamium columnae var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous wood betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, slender stems that often branch near the base, bearing opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairy covering, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other members of the genus."
