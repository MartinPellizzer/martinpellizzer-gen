    "intro": "Ledum palustre var. decumbens, commonly known as swamp labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wet, acidic environments in northern regions. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in boggy or marshy habitats. The plant contains aromatic compounds and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
