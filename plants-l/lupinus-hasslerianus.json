    "intro": "Lupinus hasslerianus, commonly known as the Mojave lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of spiny, erect stems that bear small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue. The plant has palmately divided leaves with serrated edges, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which enhance soil fertility. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Lupinus hasslerianus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
