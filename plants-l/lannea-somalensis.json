    "intro": "Lannea somalensis, commonly known as the Somali ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the dry regions of Somalia and southern Ethiopia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been heavily exploited, leading to its decline in natural habitats."
