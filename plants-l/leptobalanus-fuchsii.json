    "intro": "Leptobalanus fuchsii, commonly known as the Fuchs' alpine pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high mountain regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it forms dense, low shrubs or small trees. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
