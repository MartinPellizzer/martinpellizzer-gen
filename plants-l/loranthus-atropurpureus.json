    "intro": "Loranthus atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or purple and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating propagation. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and woodland regions."
