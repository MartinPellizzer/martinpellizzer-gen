    "intro": "Leucas biflora var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate leucas, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a aromatic scent when crushed. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
