    "intro": "Lagenandra, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they have adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Lagenandra species typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive, spurred petal structure. The plants are shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
