    "intro": "Lantana aristata, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Lantana aristata is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may pose a threat to native plant species."
