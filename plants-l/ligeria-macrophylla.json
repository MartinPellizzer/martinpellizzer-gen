It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
