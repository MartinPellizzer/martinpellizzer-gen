    "intro": "Lapaea lobata, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and stems that produce clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry environments, and its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides. Lapaea lobata is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
