    "intro": "Lilium linifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or open habitats and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
