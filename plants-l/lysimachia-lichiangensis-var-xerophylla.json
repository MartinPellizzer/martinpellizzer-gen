    "intro": "Lysimachia lichiangensis var. xerophylla, commonly known as the Yunnan trailing arum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
