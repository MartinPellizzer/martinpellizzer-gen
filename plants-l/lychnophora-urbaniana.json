    "intro": "Lychnophora urbaniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *pau-rosa*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, black berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
