    "intro": "Lafoensia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf lafoensia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for various wildlife species."
