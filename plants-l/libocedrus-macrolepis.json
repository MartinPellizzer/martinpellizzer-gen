    "intro": "Libocedrus macrolepis, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of this species are woody and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree can grow to heights of up to 60 meters, with a broad, conical crown. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
