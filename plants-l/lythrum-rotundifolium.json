The plant produces spikes of deep violet to purple flowers, which bloom from June to September. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full sun. Lythrum rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
