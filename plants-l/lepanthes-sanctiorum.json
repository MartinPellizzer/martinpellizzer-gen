    "intro": "Lepanthes sanctiorum, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Lepanthes sanctiorum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in indigenous communities."
