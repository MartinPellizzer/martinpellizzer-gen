    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. congesta, commonly known as the clustered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, though it is often mistaken for a sedge due to its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This subspecies is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
