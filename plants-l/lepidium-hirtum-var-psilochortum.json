    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum var. psilochortum, commonly known as the slender wall rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and less hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Lepidium hirtum."
