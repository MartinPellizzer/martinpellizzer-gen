It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
