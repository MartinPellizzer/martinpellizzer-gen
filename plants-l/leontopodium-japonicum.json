    "intro": "Leontopodium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale pink flower heads, which are surrounded by a cluster of bracts that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. Leontopodium japonicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
