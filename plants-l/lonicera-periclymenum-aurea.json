    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum aurea, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The golden honeysuckle is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
