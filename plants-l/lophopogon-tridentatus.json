    "intro": "Lophopogon tridentatus, commonly known as the three-toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lophopogon tridentatus typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
