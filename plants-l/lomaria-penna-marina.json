It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Lomaria penna-marina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
