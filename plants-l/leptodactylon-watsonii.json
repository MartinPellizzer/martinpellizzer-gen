    "intro": "Leptodactylon watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Sri Lanka. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance."
