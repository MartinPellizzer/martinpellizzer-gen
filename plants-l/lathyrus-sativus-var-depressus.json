    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. depressus, commonly known as the dwarf garden pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with shorter stems and smaller leaves compared to the standard garden pea. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and easy care requirements. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
