    "intro": "Lepia glastifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Lepia glastifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
