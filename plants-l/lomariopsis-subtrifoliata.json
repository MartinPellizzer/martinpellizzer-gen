    "intro": "Lomariopsis subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-leaf) fronds that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, upright stipes with pinnate leaves. The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, feathery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant."
