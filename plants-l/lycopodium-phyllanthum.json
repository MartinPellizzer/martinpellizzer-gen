    "intro": "Lycopodium phyllanthum, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Lycopodium phyllanthum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
