    "intro": "Lamium villosifolium, commonly known as hairy-leaved deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium villosifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
