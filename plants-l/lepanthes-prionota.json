    "intro": "Lepanthes prionota, commonly known as the spotted pterostigma orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature a white or pale yellow color with distinctive purple or brown markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape and are arranged in a compact rosette. Lepanthes prionota is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
