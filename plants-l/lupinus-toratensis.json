    "intro": "Lupinus toratensis, commonly known as the Toratensian lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy bristles. Lupinus toratensis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and has developed mechanisms to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats."
