    "intro": "Libocedrus plumosa, commonly known as the silver fir or mountain fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Libocedrus plumosa is often found in high-elevation forests, where it plays a key role in maintaining ecological balance."
