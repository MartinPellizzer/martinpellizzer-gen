    "intro": "Ligularia paradoxa var. paradoxa, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a dark green to reddish hue. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, preferring nutrient-rich substrates. It produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge above the water surface, typically in late summer. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in ponds and wetlands for its aesthetic appeal."
