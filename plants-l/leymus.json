    "intro": "Leymus, commonly known as wheatgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically perennial and are found in various habitats, including wetlands, meadows, and coastal areas. Leymus species are characterized by their dense, tufted growth and their ability to thrive in saline or waterlogged soils. They often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Some species are cultivated for their nutritional value, particularly as forage for livestock or as a source of vitamins and minerals in human diets."
