    "intro": "Liparis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and bog environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and somewhat succulent. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
