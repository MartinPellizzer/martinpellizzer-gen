    "intro": "Lepanthes austinae, commonly known as the Austina's slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes austinae is considered a rare and endangered species."
