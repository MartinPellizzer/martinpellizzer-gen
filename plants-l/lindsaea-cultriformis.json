    "intro": "Lindsaea cultriformis, commonly known as the cut-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often exhibit a distinctive, narrow, and sometimes serrated appearance. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, this plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Lindsaea cultriformis is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
