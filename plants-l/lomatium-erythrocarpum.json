    "intro": "Lomatium erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are distinctive and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
