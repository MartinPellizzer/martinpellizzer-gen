    "intro": "Lactuca obtusa, commonly known as broadleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly wavy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Broadleaf lettuce is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce varieties."
