    "intro": "Lophiolepis buschiana, commonly known as the Bushman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky habitats. Lophiolepis buschiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
