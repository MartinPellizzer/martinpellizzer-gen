    "intro": "Lycopodioides puberula, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophytes at the tips of its stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides puberula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
