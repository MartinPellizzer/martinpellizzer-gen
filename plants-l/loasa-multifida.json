    "intro": "Loasa multifida, commonly known as the fringed loasa, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that have a rough texture. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are often pink or red and attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Loasa multifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
