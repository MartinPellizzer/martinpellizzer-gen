    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. elatior, commonly known as greater blueweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its flowering stems are often taller than the basal leaves, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent. The species is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
