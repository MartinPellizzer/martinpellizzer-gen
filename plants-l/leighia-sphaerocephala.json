    "intro": "Leighia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow inflorescence, which resembles a torch, and its unique, spherical-shaped flower clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Leighia sphaerocephala is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
