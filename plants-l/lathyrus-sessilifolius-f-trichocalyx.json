    "intro": "Lathyrus sessilifolius f. trichocalyx, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, giving it the \"trichocalyx\" designation, which refers to the hairy calyx. The species is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
