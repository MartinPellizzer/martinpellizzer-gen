    "intro": "Lathyrus tenuior, commonly known as slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Lathyrus tenuior is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
