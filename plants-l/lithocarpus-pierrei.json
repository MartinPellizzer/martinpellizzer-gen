    "intro": "Lithocarpus pierrei, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a tall evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species."
