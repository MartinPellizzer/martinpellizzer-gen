    "intro": "Limonium commune subsp. californicum, commonly known as the California sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. This subspecies is closely related to other limonium species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and floral characteristics."
