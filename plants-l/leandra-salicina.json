It is characterized by its delicate, waxy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats. Leandra salicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
