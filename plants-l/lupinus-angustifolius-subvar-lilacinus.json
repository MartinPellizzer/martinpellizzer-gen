    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subvar. lilacinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to lilac. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
