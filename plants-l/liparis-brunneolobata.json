    "intro": "Liparis brunneolobata, commonly known as the brown-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often reddish or brownish markings on its petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial orchid, attaching itself to trees or growing in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive lip that is often more brightly colored than the rest of the flower. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
