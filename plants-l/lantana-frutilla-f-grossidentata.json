    "intro": "Lantana frutilla f. grossidentata, commonly known as the Florida lantana, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in some regions."
