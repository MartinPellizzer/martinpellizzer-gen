    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus var. linifolius, commonly known as the slender field bean, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and compound leaves. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and slender stems, which help it thrive in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
