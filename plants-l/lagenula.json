    "intro": "Lagenula, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that appear in early spring. Lagenula species typically have palmately divided leaves and are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are often found in woodland habitats and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to their striking appearance, they are occasionally cultivated in gardens, though some species are considered toxic."
