    "intro": "Lueddemannia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. It consists of only one species, Lueddemannia serotina, which is native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often appearing in late summer or autumn. Lueddemannia is a perennial herb that grows from a bulbous stem, and it is known for its striking appearance and relatively rare occurrence in the wild. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
