    "intro": "Lepisanthes tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with four petals, giving it its common name. The plant has strap-like, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lepisanthes tetraphylla thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
