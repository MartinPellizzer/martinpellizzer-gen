It is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, leathery leaves and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction."
