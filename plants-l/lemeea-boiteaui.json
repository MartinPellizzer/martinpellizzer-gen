    "intro": "Lemeea boiteaui, commonly known as the Boiteau's lemeea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
