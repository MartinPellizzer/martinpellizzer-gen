    "intro": "Loranthus schelei, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pale green berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a sweet scent that attracts insects for pollination. Loranthus schelei plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting local biodiversity."
