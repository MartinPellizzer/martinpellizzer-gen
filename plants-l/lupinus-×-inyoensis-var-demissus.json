    "intro": "Lupinus \u00d7 inyoensis var. demissus, commonly known as the Inyo lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
