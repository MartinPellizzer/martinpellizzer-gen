    "intro": "Leuzea nitida, commonly known as silverleaf leuzea, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking leaf color and compact growth habit."
