    "intro": "Larix dahurica f. viridis, commonly known as the Green Larch, is a unique variant of the Dahurian Larch. It is characterized by its distinctive green foliage, which remains throughout the growing season, unlike the typical yellow or golden needles of other larch species. This form is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including parts of Russia and China. The plant is a coniferous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a conical shape and persistent, needle-like leaves. Its botanical features make it an ornamental and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
