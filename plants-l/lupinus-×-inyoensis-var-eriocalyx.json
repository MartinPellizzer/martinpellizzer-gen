    "intro": "Lupinus \u00d7 inyoensis var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the Inyo lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
