    "intro": "Lepanthes pensilis, commonly known as the pendant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, pendant-like growth habit, with flowers that hang from the stems. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often with intricate patterns. Lepanthes pensilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and elegant blooms make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
