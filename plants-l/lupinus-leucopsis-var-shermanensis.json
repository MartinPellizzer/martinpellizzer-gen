    "intro": "Lupinus leucopsis var. shermanensis, commonly known as the Sherman's white lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and rocky environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and other dry habitats."
