It is characterized by its cylindrical, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy, lightweight structures. The plant typically grows as a vine, with palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in warm climates and requires full sun for optimal growth. The fruit is often used for its sponge-like texture, which is popular in skincare and as a natural exfoliant."
