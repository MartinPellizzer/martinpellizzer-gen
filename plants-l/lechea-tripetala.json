    "intro": "Lechea tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its latex is milky and contains compounds that are toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. Lechea tripetala plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
