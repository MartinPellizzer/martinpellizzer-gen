It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and mountainous regions. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
