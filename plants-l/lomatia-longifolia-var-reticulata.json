    "intro": "Lomatia longifolia var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate lomatia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is compact, with a spreading form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant. The species is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
