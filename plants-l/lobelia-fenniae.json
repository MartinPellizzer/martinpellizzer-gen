    "intro": "Lobelia fenniae, commonly known as the Fennian lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lobelia fenniae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
