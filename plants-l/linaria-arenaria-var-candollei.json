    "intro": "Linaria arenaria var. candollei, commonly known as the sand everlasting or sand linaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in survival in sandy soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
