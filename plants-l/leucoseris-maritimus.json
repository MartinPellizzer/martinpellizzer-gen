    "intro": "Leucoseris maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leucoseris maritimus is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
