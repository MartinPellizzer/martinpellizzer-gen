    "intro": "Lycopodium recurvum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Lycopodium recurvum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
