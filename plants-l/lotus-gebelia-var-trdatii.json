    "intro": "Lotus gebelia var. trdatii, commonly known as the Armenian lotus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are typical of the legume family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
