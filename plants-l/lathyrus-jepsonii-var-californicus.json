    "intro": "Lathyrus jepsonii var. californicus, commonly known as the California vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates, making it a common sight in coastal regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
