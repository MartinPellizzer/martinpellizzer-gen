    "intro": "Lentago, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by aggregate fruits known as \"mulberries.\" Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the fruit is edible, though sometimes bitter. Lentago is also valued for its role in silk production, as its leaves are the primary food source for silkworms."
