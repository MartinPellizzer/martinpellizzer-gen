    "intro": "Lonicera sempervirens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf trumpet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems and small, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a red, fleshy capsule that matures in the fall, dispersing seeds through birds. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
