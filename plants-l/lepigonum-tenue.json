It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible rhubarb-like stems. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color and are covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they tend to be arranged alternately along the stem. Lepigonum tenue is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
