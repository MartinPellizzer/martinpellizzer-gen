    "intro": "Lycium petraeum, commonly known as the rock gooseberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing clusters of pale yellow flowers. Lycium petraeum is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
