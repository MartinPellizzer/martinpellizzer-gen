    "intro": "Lindsaea ensifolia var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant feather fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid forests of Central and South America. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that support its expansive foliage. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical L. ensifolia, often reaching heights of several meters in its natural habitat."
