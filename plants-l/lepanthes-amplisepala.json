    "intro": "Lepanthes amplisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature a wide, spurred lip and intricate petal arrangements. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical structure includes a short, fibrous root system and a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Lepanthes amplisepala is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and unique floral morphology."
