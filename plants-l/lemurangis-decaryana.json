    "intro": "Lemurangis decaryana, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. The orchid is primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, making it an important species in its ecosystem."
