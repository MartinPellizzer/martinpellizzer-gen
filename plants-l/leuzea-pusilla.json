    "intro": "Leuzea pusilla, commonly known as dwarf leuzea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
