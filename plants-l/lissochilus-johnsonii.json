    "intro": "Lissochilus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's lissochilus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Lissochilus johnsonii is considered a rare and endangered species."
