    "intro": "Linaria repens var. multiflora, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with four petals, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
