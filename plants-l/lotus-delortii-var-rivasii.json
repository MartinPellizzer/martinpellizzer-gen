    "intro": "Lotus delortii var. rivasii, commonly known as the Rivasii lotus, is a rare and ornamental aquatic plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are broad and smooth, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
