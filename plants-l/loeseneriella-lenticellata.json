    "intro": "Loeseneriella lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It features a thallus that is typically pale to dark green, with a smooth surface covered in small, rounded pores called lenticels. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its ability to thrive in diverse environments. Its morphology includes a leaf-like structure with a central axis and radiating lobes. Loeseneriella lenticellata is often found on rock surfaces or tree bark in temperate regions, where it plays a role in ecological succession and soil formation."
