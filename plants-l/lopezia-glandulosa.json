    "intro": "Lopezia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular Lopezia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor nutrient conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine glands, which may play a role in water retention or chemical defense. Lopezia glandulosa is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
