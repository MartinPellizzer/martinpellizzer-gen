    "intro": "Lygistum marginatum, commonly known as the red-edged dragon tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a distinctive red margin that contrasts with their deep green centers. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant in suitable environments."
