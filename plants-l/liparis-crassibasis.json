    "intro": "Liparis crassibasis, commonly known as the broad-based orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to yellowish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
