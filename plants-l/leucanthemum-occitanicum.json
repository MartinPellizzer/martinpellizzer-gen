    "intro": "Leucanthemum occitanicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean whitehead, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in mountainous and rocky habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with white ray florets. It blooms in the summer months and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
