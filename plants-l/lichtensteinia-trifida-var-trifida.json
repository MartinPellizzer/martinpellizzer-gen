    "intro": "Lichtensteinia trifida var. trifida, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces bright yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a single, showy head. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in drought conditions."
