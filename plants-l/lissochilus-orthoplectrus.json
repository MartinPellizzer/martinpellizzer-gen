    "intro": "Lissochilus orthoplectrus, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cooler, humid environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in loose soil, while its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
