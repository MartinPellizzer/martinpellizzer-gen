    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. vicina, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a rare and diminutive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and northern Europe. The plant features small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and densely packed, providing a dense ground cover. This form is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
