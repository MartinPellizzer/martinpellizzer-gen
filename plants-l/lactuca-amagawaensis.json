    "intro": "Lactuca amagawaensis, commonly known as the Amagawa lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is native to Japan, specifically found in the Amagawa River valley, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are typically harvested for culinary use, though it is not as widely cultivated as other lettuce varieties. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
