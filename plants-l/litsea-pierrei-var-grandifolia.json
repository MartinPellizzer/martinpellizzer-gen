It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its aromatic, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by yellowish-orange berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
