    "intro": "Laelia, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are known for their striking and diverse floral displays. Laelia species typically have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling them to thrive in various environmental conditions. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Laelia orchids are popular among horticulturists for their resilience and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year."
