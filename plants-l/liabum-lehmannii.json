It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with trifoliate leaves and stipules. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.
