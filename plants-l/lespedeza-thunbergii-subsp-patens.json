    "intro": "Lespedeza thunbergii subsp. patens, commonly known as the creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture. It is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in poor soils."
