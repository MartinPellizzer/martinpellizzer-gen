    "intro": "Liparis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, and they are pollinated by insects. Liparis wightiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
