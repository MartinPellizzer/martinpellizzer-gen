It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Lecythopsis guianensis is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure."
