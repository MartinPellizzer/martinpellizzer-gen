    "intro": "Lindera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its small, fragrant flowers appear in late spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Lindera angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
