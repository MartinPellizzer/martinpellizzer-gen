    "intro": "Lissanthe rigida, commonly known as rigid lissanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lissanthe rigida is often found in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, warm climates."
