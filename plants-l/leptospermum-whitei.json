    "intro": "Leptospermum whitei, commonly known as the white tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Leptospermum whitei is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
