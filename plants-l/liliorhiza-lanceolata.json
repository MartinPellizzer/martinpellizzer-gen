    "intro": "Liliorhiza lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white to pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in shallow waters. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface that repels water. Liliorhiza lanceolata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
