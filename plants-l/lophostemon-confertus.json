    "intro": "Lophostemon confertus, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges in color from grey to dark brown. The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and have a rough, serrated texture, often appearing dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
