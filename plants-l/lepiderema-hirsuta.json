It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common trait in the carrot family. Lepiderema hirsuta typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
