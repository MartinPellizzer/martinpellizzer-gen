    "intro": "Leiocarpa tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its cap. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. The fruiting body is small, with a rounded cap and a stalk that is usually shorter than the cap itself. The spore-producing structures, called ascocarps, are embedded within the cap and release spores through a small, central opening. This fungus is primarily found in temperate regions and is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
