    "intro": "Loxogramme flavescens, commonly known as the yellow water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, feather-like segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Loxogramme flavescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
