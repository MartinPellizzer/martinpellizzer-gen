    "intro": "Lonicera implexa var. longifolia, commonly known as the longflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, making it an important nectar source. The plant also bears small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
