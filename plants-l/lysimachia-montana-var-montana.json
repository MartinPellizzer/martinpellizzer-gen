    "intro": "Lysimachia montana var. montana, commonly known as mountain yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
