    "intro": "Lomaria bibreae, commonly known as the golden lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss. Lomaria bibreae is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
