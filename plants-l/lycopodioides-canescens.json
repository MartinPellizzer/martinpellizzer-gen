    "intro": "Lycopodioides canescens, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to arid and rocky habitats, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its historical significance in paleobotany highlights its role in the evolution of early land plants."
