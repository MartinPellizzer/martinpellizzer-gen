    "intro": "Linum prostratum var. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate flax, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Prostrate flax is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
