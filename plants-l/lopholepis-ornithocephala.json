    "intro": "Lopholepis ornithocephala, commonly known as the bird's head fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a bird's head, with a prominent central rib and lobed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature may vary among different populations."
