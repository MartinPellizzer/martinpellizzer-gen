    "intro": "Lloydia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Crassulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lloydia triflora is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
