    "intro": "Limnophila barteri, commonly known as the water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, bright green leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Limnophila barteri is also known for its ability to help control algae by competing for nutrients in the water."
