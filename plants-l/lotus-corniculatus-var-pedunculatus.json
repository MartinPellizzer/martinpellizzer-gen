    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its trifoliate leaves are simple and heart-shaped, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
