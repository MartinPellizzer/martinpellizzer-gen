    "intro": "Leptochiton helianthus, commonly known as the sunflower snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Lepetellidae. It is characterized by its small, conical shell that is often adorned with intricate, spiral patterns. This marine gastropod is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and detritus. The shell's coloration can vary, often reflecting the surrounding environment for camouflage. Its presence is an indicator of healthy marine ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
