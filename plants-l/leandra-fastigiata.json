    "intro": "Leandra fastigiata, commonly known as the upright leandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and its striking, long-lasting white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its elegant appearance. Due to its specific growing requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation outside its native range."
