It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature. Lomatogonium stapfii is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
