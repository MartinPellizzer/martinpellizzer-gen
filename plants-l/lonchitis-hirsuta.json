    "intro": "Lonchitis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition strategies."
