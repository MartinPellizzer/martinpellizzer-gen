    "intro": "Lupinus fulvomaculatus, commonly known as the yellow-spotted lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like, yellow flowers with distinctive orange or reddish spots. The plant has compound leaves composed of oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. Lupinus fulvomaculatus is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
