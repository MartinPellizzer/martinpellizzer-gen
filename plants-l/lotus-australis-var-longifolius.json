    "intro": "Lotus australis var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water margins. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
