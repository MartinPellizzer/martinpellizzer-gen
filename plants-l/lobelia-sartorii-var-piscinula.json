    "intro": "Lobelia sartorii var. piscinula, commonly known as the aquatic lobelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often submerged or floating stems and small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
