    "intro": "Leptospermum scoparium var. bullatum, commonly known as the silver mat (or silver-leaved) tea tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. This variety is notable for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
