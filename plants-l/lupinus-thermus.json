    "intro": "Lupinus thermus, commonly known as the thermophilic lupin, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of spiny pods containing seeds. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus thermus is part of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
