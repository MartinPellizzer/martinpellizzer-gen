    "intro": "Ligularia veitchiana, commonly known as the Veitch's ligularia, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often green with a reddish or bronze edge. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
