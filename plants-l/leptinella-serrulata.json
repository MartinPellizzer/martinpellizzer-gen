    "intro": "Leptinella serrulata, commonly known as the serrated rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
