    "intro": "Lobelia asperulata, commonly known as the roughleaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Lobelia asperulata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
