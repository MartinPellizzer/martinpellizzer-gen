    "intro": "Lepanthes costata, commonly known as the ridged slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vivid colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are notable for their unique shape, resembling a slipper or pouch, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. Lepanthes costata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
