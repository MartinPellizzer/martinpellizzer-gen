It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that provide year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant in landscaped areas."
