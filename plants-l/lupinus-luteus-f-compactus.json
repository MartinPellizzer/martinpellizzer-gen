It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
