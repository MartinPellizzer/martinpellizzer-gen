    "intro": "Liriosma adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping liriosma, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Marantaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Liriosma adhaerens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
