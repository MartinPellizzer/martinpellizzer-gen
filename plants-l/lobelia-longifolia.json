    "intro": "Lobelia longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
