    "intro": "Lisianthius uliginosus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the swamp lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its striking yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
