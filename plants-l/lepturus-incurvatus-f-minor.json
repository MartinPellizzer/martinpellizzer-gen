    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus f. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved lepturus, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to specific regions in Europe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
