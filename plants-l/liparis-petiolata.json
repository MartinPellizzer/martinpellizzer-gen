    "intro": "Liparis petiolata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Liparis petiolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
