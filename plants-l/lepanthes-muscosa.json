    "intro": "Lepanthes muscosa, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often pale or white flowers that resemble a misty appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators like bees and moths."
