    "intro": "Lespedeza melanantha, commonly known as black lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Black lespedeza is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
