    "intro": "Lantana camara var. crocea, commonly known as the golden lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
