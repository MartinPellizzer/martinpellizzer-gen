    "intro": "Lycopodium caesium arboreum, commonly known as the tree clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and scale-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Lycopodium caesium arboreum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
