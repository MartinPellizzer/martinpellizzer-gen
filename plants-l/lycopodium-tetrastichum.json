    "intro": "Lycopodium tetrastichum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycophyta. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a branching stem system that resembles a club, hence its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodium tetrastichum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
