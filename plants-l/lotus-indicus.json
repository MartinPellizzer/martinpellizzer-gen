    "intro": "Lotus indicus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant has a distinctive stem that rises from the water's surface, supporting its vibrant blooms. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water. The lotus is also notable for its symbolic significance in various cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
