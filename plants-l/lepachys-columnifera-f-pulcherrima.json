    "intro": "Lepachys columnifera f. pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear clusters of vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces segmented, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. Its flowers open sequentially, often in response to cooler temperatures and longer nights, making it a popular holiday plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
