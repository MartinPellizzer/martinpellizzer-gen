    "intro": "Liparis flavoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
