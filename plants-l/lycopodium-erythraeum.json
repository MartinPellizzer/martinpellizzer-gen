    "intro": "Lycopodium erythraeum, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often bright green or reddish in color, depending on the variety. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Lycopodium erythraeum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in containers or as part of a woodland garden."
