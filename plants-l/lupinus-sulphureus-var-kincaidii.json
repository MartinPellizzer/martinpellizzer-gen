    "intro": "Lupinus sulphureus var. kincaidii, commonly known as Kincaid's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and palmately compound leaves, which are typical of the Lupinus genus. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting other plant species. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
