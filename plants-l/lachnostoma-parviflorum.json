    "intro": "Lachnostoma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus composed of a cortex, medulla, and a layer of algae or cyanobacteria. Its small, rounded lobes are often covered in a thin, leathery layer. Lachnostoma parviflorum is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality."
