    "intro": "Laetia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-laetia, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during prolonged droughts. Laetia coriacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
