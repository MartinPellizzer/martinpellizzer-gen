    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. sitchense, commonly known as the Sichuan clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss native to China. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, spore-bearing strobili and needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, a key feature of its evolutionary development. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
