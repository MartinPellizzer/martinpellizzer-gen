    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 notha, commonly known as the yellow honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellow to orange-red tubular flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Lonicera \u00d7 notha is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
