    "intro": "Lasiosiphon leandrianus, commonly known as the blue bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. Its stems are usually hairy and can climb or trail, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
