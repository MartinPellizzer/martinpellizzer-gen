    "intro": "Ludwigia palustris var. americana, commonly known as the American water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It is often used in aquatic habitats for its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
