    "intro": "Lepanthes cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban orchid, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude cloud forests in Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces inflorescences with multiple fragrant blooms. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
