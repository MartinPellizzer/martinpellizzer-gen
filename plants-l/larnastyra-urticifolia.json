    "intro": "Larnastyra urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants like common nettle. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, irritating hairs. Its small greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle due to its stinging properties."
