    "intro": "Lupulus amarus, commonly known as bitter hop, is a member of the Humulus genus within the Cannabaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are used in brewing for their bittering properties. Its cones contain lupulin, a resinous substance responsible for the distinctive bitterness in beer. Lupulus amarus thrives in temperate climates and is typically cultivated in regions with ample sunlight and well-drained soil."
