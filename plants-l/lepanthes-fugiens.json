    "intro": "Lepanthes fugiens, commonly known as the elusive orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornamental, with intricate patterns and a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Lepanthes fugiens is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
