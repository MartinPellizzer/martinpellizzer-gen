    "intro": "Lindera heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often variable-shaped leaves that range from elliptic to ovate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible and aromatic. Its foliage and fruit are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lindera heterophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas."
