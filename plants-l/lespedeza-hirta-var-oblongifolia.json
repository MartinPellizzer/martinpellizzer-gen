    "intro": "Lespedeza hirta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sericea, is a perennial forage plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, oblong-lanceolate leaves that are hairy along the edges and upper surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
