    "intro": "Lucilia paramora, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of blow fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and is often found near decaying organic matter. The larvae of Lucilia paramora play a role in decomposition and are sometimes used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death. The plant-like appearance of its larvae has led to its association with certain medicinal practices in traditional cultures. Its life cycle is closely tied to environments with high humidity and abundant organic material."
