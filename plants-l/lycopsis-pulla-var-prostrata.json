    "intro": "Lycopsis pulla var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lycopsis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
