    "intro": "Lycaste harrisoniae var. eburnea, commonly known as the Harrison's nightshade lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple, often with a distinctive red or pink tinge. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in drier environments. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relative difficulty in cultivation."
