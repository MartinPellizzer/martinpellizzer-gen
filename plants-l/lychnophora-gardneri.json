    "intro": "Lychnophora gardneri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
