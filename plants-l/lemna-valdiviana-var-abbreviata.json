    "intro": "Lemna valdiviana var. abbreviata, commonly known as the Valdivia water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant is native to South America, particularly Chile, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats that can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
