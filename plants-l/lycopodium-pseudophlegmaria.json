It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are often found in clusters. Lycopodium pseudophlegmaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
