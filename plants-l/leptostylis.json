    "intro": "Leptostylis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plants typically have linear or strap-shaped leaves and produce showy, often fragrant flowers in a variety of colors. Leptostylis species are native to regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants or in botanical gardens."
