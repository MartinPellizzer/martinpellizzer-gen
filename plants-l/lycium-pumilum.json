    "intro": "Lycium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that give way to red berries. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and is drought-tolerant. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor. Lycium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
