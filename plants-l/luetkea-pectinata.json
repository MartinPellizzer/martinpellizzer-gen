    "intro": "Luetkea pectinata, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, lobed segments, resembling the shape of clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored to the substrate, while its stems and leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface. Luetkea pectinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
