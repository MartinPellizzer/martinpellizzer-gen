    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. lulensis, commonly known as the Lulensk dewflower, is a rare and diminutive evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are prostrate and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
