    "intro": "Leymus mundus, commonly known as the European soft grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leymus mundus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
