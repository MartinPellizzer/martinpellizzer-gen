    "intro": "Loxogramme, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the leaves of clover, hence their common name. Loxogramme species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Their rhizomes often form dense mats on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. The genus includes several species, with Loxogramme lingua being one of the most well-known for its distinctive, tongue-shaped fronds."
