    "intro": "Loranthus tetranthus, commonly known as the four-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
