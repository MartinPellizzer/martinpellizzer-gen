    "intro": "Lonchocarpus rariflorus, commonly known as the rare-flowered legume, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that mature to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
