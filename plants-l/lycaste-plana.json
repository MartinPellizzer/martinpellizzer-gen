    "intro": "Lycaste plana, commonly known as the flat-leaf lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow, often in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Lycaste plana is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has swollen stems that store water and nutrients."
