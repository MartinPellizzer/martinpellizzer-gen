It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, violet-blue flowers with prominent, hood-like petals that enclose the reproductive structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Limodorum cucullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
