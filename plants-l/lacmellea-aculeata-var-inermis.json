    "intro": "Lacmellea aculeata var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-armed velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in spikes, and are typically greenish-white in color. This variant is notable for its lack of spines on the stems, distinguishing it from the typical form of Lacmellea aculeata."
