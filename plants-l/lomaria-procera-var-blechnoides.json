    "intro": "Lomaria procera var. blechnoides, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its tall, upright growth habit. Its foliage is typically dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems."
