    "intro": "Lupinus nanus var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. The plant features clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into three to five narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing dune systems and providing nectar for pollinators."
