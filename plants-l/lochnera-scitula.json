    "intro": "Lochnera scitula, commonly known as the narrowleaf lochnera, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. Lochnera scitula plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
