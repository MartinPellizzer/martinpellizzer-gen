It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant features large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow-orange coloration, which sets it apart from other lily species. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variant is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
