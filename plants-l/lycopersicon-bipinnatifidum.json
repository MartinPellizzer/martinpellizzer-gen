    "intro": "Lycopersicon bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the wild tomato, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a bipinnatifid structure, giving them a finely divided appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and it produces small, green fruits that turn red when mature. This plant is closely related to the domesticated tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value."
