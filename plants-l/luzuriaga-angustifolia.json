    "intro": "Luzuriaga angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Luzuriaga angustifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens with suitable conditions."
