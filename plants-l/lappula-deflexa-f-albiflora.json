    "intro": "Lappula deflexa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lappula, is a variant of the lappula plant characterized by its pale or white flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. This form is distinguished by its reduced floral pigmentation compared to the typical green-flowered variety."
