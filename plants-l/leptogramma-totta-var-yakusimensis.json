    "intro": "Leptogramma totta var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a rare variant of the leptogramma genus native to the Japanese island of Yakushima. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the dense canopies of evergreen forests. Its leaves are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
