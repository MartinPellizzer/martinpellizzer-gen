    "intro": "Lobelia erinus var. grandiflora, commonly known as the summer lobelia, is a compact, trailing plant native to South Africa. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming profusely from summer to fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and ability to cascade gracefully from hanging baskets."
