    "intro": "Leobordea adpressa subsp. leptantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leobordea, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
