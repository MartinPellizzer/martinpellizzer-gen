    "intro": "Lathyrus gorgoni var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy gorgon vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are pinnately compound, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
