It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-parted flowers. Luzula vinogradovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its upright growth and seasonal interest."
