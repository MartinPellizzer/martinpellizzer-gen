    "intro": "Lidbeckia bipinnata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bipinnately arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. These flowers are typically borne in long, pendulous inflorescences, which resemble a shower of golden blooms. Lidbeckia bipinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
