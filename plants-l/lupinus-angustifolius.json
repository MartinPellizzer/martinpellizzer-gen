    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved lupin, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus angustifolius is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
