It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, showcasing adaptations to extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Lygeum loscosii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
