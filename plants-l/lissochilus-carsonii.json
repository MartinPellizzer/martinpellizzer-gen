It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat.
