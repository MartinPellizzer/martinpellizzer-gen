It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its flowering pattern is adapted to attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid environments."
