    "intro": "Lophatherum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese lophatherum, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of understory vegetation."
