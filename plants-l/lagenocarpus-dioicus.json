    "intro": "Lagenocarpus dioicus, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps. The plant has distinctive, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its propagation in wetland habitats."
