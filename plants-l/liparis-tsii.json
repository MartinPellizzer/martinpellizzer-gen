    "intro": "Liparis tsii, commonly known as the Chinese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to China. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and a single, leafless stem. The plant produces two to four showy, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale green with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
