    "intro": "Lepanthes membranacea, commonly known as the membranous slipper orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
