    "intro": "Lantana, commonly known as the shrub or flowering plant, is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is native to the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to red, orange, and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Lantana species are known for their aromatic leaves and showy blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. However, some species are invasive in certain regions and can become problematic in natural ecosystems."
