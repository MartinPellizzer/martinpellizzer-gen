It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
