    "intro": "Lobelia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
