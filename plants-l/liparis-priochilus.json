    "intro": "Liparis priochilus, commonly known as the purple-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with pale yellow petals and a distinctive purple lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
