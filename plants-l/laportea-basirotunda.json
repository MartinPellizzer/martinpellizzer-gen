    "intro": "Laportea basirotunda, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of purple to violet flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
