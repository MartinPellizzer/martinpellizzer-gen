    "intro": "Lavoisiera pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Lavoisiera pulcherrima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions as a garden plant."
