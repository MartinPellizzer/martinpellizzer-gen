    "intro": "Lonchitis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
