It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge. Lepigonum glandulosum is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
