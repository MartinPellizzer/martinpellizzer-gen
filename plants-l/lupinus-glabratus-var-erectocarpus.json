    "intro": "Lupinus glabratus var. erectocarpus, commonly known as the tall carpathian lupine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of bright blue to purple pea-like flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is highly nodulated, hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria that enhance soil fertility. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid and semi-arid environments."
