    "intro": "Lycopodium polycladum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lycopodium polycladum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground cover."
