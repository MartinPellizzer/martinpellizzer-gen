It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that bloom in summer, often in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Its flowers are actually clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers surrounded by the colorful bracts. Lagerstroemia indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
