It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.
