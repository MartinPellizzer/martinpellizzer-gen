    "intro": "Lathyrus sphaericus var. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy globe bean, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, inflated pods that resemble small globes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers and has hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Lathyrus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
