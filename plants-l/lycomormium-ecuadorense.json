    "intro": "Lycomormium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian lycomormium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in moist and cool conditions. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to withstand the strong winds and low temperatures of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycomormium ecuadorense is considered a vulnerable species."
