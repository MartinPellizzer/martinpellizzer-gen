    "intro": "Linaria racemosa, commonly known as the clustered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Linaria racemosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
