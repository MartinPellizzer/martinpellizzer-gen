It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with needle-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
