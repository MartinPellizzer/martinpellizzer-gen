    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum f. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms."
