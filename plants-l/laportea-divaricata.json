    "intro": "Laportea divaricata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea divaricata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
