    "intro": "Limonium nymphaeum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking spikes of blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found near the sea. Limonium nymphaeum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
