    "intro": "Lannea alata, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Lannea alata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
