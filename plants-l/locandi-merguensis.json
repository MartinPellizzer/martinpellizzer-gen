    "intro": "Locandi merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensian flame vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters along its long, woody stems. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a glossy green surface with a slightly waxy texture. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a vigorous grower in suitable conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
