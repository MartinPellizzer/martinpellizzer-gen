    "intro": "Lupinus caudatus subsp. caudatus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system consists of nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and serving as a forage plant for livestock."
