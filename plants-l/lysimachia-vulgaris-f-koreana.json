It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover in moist, shady environments."
