    "intro": "Leptopteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland areas. Its spores are released from sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Leptopteris alpina plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of alpine and mountainous freshwater habitats."
