    "intro": "Leandra foveolata, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on rocky substrates or tree canopies. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Leandra foveolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
