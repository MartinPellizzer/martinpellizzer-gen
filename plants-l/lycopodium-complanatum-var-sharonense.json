    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. sharonense, commonly known as Sharon's clubmoss, is a rare and small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a low-growing habit, typically forming dense mats on the forest floor. This variety is native to specific regions in the Middle East and is adapted to moist, shaded environments. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called strobili, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ecological interest."
