    "intro": "Labichea diversifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved labichea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by stipules. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. The variety brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Labichea diversifolia."
