    "intro": "Lupinus somaliensis, commonly known as Somali lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the dry season. Lupinus somaliensis is adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and may have potential uses in sustainable agriculture."
