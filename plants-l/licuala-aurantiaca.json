    "intro": "Licuala aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-veined areca palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves with prominent red veins that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its trunk is smooth and slender, with a fibrous sheath that peels away as the plant matures. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
