    "intro": "Lithocardium diospyrifolium, commonly known as the rock fig, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are encased in a fleshy, edible covering, similar to that of figs. Its growth is typically found in rocky or limestone soils, where it forms dense clusters along crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Lithocardium diospyrifolium is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
