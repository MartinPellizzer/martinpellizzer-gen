    "intro": "Lithoplis saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found on stone surfaces in temperate and cold regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh environments. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health."
