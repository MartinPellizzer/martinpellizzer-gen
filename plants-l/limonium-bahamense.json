    "intro": "Limonium bahamense, commonly known as the Bahamian sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to maritime climates and saline conditions. Limonium bahamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
