    "intro": "Lepidella sabaensis, commonly known as the Saba sandpenny, is a small, annual herb native to the Caribbean region. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in the Bahamas and other nearby islands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, which allows it to thrive in coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
