    "intro": "Leptochilus ellipticus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed elliptic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, triangular stems that are often densely packed, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is characterized by its elongated stems, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
