    "intro": "Lycopodioides surculosa, commonly known as the curled clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves that form compact, cushion-like structures. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of spores, which are dispersed by wind to initiate new growth."
