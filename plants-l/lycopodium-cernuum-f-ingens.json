    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum f. ingens, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the base of its stems, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This fern ally is often found in the understory of temperate forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
