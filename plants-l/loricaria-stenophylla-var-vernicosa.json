    "intro": "Loricaria stenophylla var. vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and glossy leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or humid woodlands. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The varietal form 'vernicosa' refers to the waxy, shiny texture of its leaves, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat."
