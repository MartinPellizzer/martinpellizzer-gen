    "intro": "Leucanthemum algidum, commonly known as the alpine oxeye, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its white flowers with a yellow center, resembling daisies, and is often found in rocky or grassy areas at high altitudes. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has a compact, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. Leucanthemum algidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
