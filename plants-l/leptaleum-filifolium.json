    "intro": "Leptaleum filifolium, commonly known as the silky mountain mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in dense, rounded clusters, typical of the mint family. Leptaleum filifolium is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
