    "intro": "Lasiocarpus, commonly known as sweet fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Lasiocarpus bicolor, which is native to North America. The plant is characterized by its fern-like foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, almost woolly appearance. Lasiocarpus is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
