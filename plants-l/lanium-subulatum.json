    "intro": "Lanium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland understories and wetlands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lanium subulatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
