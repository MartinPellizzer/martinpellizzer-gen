    "intro": "Lenophyllum obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, or flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually broad and can be either flat or curled, depending on environmental conditions. Lenophyllum obtusum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
