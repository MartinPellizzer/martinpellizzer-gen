    "intro": "Larnax, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in the Nile River basin. Larnax has been revered for its symbolic and medicinal properties throughout history. Its roots and leaves were used in religious rituals and traditional medicine."
