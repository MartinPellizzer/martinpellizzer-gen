    "intro": "Loranthus productus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it receives. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread. Loranthus productus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, playing a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
