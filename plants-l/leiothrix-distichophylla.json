    "intro": "Leiothrix distichophylla, commonly known as the two-ranked leiothrix, is a rare and unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked arrangement of fronds, which gives it a striking visual appearance. The plant has compound leaves with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
