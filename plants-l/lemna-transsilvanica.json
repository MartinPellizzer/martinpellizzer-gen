    "intro": "Lemna transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through the production of tubers. Lemna transsilvanica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain conditions."
