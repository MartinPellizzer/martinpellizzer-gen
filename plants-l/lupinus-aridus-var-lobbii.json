    "intro": "Lupinus aridus var. lobbii, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Lupinus aridus var. lobbii plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife in its native range."
