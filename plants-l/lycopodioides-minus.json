    "intro": "Lycopodioides minus, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Lycopodioides minus typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for studying early plant evolution."
