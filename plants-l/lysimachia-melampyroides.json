It features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
