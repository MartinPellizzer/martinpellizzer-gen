    "intro": "Leianthus exsertus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a notable botanical feature. Leianthus exsertus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
