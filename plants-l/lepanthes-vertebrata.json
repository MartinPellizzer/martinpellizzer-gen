    "intro": "Lepanthes vertebrata, commonly known as the vertebral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. Lepanthes vertebrata is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
