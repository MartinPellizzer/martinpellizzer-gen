It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers in the shape of a spurred orchid, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with the spurred structure aiding in nectar access. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a member of the Plantaginaceae family."
