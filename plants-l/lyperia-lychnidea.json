    "intro": "Lyperia lychnidea, commonly known as the nightshade lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The thallus is typically leathery and can form dense mats on trees, rocks, or soil. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often found in forested areas. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
