    "intro": "Lactuca denticulata var. sonchifolia, commonly known as the dented lettuce or a variant of the common lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variant is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly used than other lettuce varieties."
