It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
