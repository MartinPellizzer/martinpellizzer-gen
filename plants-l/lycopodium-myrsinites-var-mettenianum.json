    "intro": "Lycopodium myrsinites var. mettenianum, commonly known as the Mettenianum clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing strobila that form at the tips of its stems. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a feature common among many primitive plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
