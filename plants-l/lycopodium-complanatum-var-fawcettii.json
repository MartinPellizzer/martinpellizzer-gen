    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcett's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It features dense, needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its compact growth habit and ability to retain moisture make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
