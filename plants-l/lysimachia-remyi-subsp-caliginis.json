It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration projects and ecological landscaping."
