    "intro": "Lewisia eastwoodiana, commonly known as Eastwood's lewisia, is a striking perennial plant native to the rocky slopes of the Sierra Nevada in California. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink to lavender, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolution to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
