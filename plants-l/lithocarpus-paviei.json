    "intro": "Lithocarpus paviei, commonly known as the Burmese ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, persistent acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the genus Lithocarpus. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The plant thrives in tropical rainforests and is valued for its durable timber and ecological importance in its native habitat."
