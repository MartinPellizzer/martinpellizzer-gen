    "intro": "Lloydia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lloydia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is a perennial species that produces flowers in the summer months, often in shades of pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
