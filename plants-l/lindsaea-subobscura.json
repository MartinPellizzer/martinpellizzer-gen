    "intro": "Lindsaea subobscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Lindsaea subobscura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
