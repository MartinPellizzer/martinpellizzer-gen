    "intro": "Ligusticum filicinum, commonly known as water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, and it thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
