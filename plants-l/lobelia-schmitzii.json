    "intro": "Lobelia schmitzii, commonly known as Schmitz's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and crevices, where it thrives in well-drained soil. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
