    "intro": "Lomatium repostum, commonly known as mountain lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use, though it is considered endangered due to habitat loss. Lomatium repostum plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
