    "intro": "Lamium galeobdolon f. montanum, commonly known as the mountain dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly larger leaves compared to the typical form of Lamium galeobdolon."
