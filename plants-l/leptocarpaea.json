    "intro": "Leptocarpaea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and a unique growth habit that involves epiphytic or lithophytic lifestyles. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, relying on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its leaves are elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Leptocarpaea is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
