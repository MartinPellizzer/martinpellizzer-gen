    "intro": "Lagochilus balchanicus, commonly known as the Balchan's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lagochilus balchanicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
