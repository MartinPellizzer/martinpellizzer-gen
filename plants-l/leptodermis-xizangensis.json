    "intro": "Leptodermis xizangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan leatherleaf, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
