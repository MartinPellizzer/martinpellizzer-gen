    "intro": "Lepanthes stimsonii, commonly known as the Stewart's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a delicate, grass-like appearance, featuring a single, narrow pseudobulb. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white to pale pink spathe and a yellow lip, which is characteristic of many Lepanthes species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
