    "intro": "Leandra bullosa, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble small balloons. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are typically borne in terminal clusters. Leandra bullosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
