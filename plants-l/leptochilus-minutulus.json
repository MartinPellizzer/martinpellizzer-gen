    "intro": "Leptochilus minutulus, commonly known as the small-leaved rock cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or arctic environments. It is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North America. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
