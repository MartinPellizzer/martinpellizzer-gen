It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a subtle golden hue along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by black berries that are attractive to birds. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for hedging and ornamental landscaping. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
