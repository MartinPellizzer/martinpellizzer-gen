It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
