    "intro": "Lecointea, commonly known as the lecointea plant, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Lecointea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
