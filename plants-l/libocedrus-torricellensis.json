    "intro": "Libocedrus torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricella cedar, is a species of conifer native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
