    "intro": "Limonium albidum subsp. cyprium, commonly known as Cyprus sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Limonium albidum subsp. cyprium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments."
