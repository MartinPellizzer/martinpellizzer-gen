    "intro": "Lepidium calycotrichum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wall peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, white flowers. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, round seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. This variety is distinguished by its lack of hair on its stems and leaves, giving it a smooth appearance."
