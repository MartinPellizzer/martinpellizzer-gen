    "intro": "Lupinus fieldsianus, commonly known as the Fields' lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus fieldsianus plays an important ecological role by improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
