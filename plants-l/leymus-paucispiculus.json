    "intro": "Leymus paucispiculus, commonly known as the few-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra, alpine meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in small, compact groups, giving the plant its characteristic appearance."
