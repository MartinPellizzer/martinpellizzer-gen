    "intro": "Leersia ligularis f. breviligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild rice, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
