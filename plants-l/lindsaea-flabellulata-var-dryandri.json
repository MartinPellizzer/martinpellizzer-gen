    "intro": "Lindsaea flabellulata var. dryandri, commonly known as the dryandri lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
