    "intro": "Loranthus elatus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain sticky seeds. These seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, facilitating the plant's spread to new hosts. Loranthus elatus plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, influencing host tree growth and supporting a variety of wildlife."
