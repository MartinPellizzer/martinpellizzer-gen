    "intro": "Lomariopsis setchellii, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Lomariopsis setchellii is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
