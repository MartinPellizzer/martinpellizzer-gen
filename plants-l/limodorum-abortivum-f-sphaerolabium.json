    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum f. sphaerolabium, commonly known as the spherical-labellum lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, dense inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that have a unique, rounded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
