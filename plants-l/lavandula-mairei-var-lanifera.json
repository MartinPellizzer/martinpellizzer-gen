    "intro": "Lavandula mairei var. lanifera, commonly known as the woolly lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Corsica. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lavender flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it both ornamental and useful in essential oil production."
