It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are characterized by their rough, serrated margins and a leathery texture, which distinguishes it from other variants. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
