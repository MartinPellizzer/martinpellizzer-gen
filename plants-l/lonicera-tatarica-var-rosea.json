It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to red. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Lonicera tatarica var. rosea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
