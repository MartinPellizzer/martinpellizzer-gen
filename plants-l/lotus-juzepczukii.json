    "intro": "Lotus juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
