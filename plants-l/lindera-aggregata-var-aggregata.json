    "intro": "Lindera aggregata var. aggregata, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a spicy, peppery flavor, making them a popular ingredient in some regional cuisines. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
