    "intro": "Lastrea sparsa var. nitidula, commonly known as the smooth lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many succulents. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
