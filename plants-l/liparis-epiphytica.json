    "intro": "Liparis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale in color."
