    "intro": "Leea bulusanensis, commonly known as the Bulusan leea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on the stems. It is typically found in lowland to montane forests, growing as an understory plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
