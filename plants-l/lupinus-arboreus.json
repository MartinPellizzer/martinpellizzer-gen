    "intro": "Lupinus arboreus, commonly known as the tree lupin, is a perennial shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces spikes of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus arboreus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal habitats, including dunes and cliffs. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
