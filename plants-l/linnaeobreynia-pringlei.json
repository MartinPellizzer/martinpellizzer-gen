    "intro": "Linnaeobreynia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and rain. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming only for a few days, which makes sightings rare. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linnaeobreynia pringlei is considered a critically endangered species."
