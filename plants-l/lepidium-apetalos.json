    "intro": "Lepidium apetalos, commonly known as the rock pepper or desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pods containing tiny, rounded seeds. Lepidium apetalos is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to the ecological diversity of these harsh environments."
