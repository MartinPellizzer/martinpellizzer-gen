    "intro": "Lolium \u00d7 portalii, commonly known as the hybrid ryegrass, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Festuca arundinacea (timothy grass). It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically exhibits a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for spread. It is often used in forage production and turfgrass research due to its adaptability and genetic diversity."
