    "intro": "Lonicera graebneri, commonly known as the Florida honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall and is an important food source for birds. Lonicera graebneri is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
