    "intro": "Leptospermum cuneiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, aromatic foliage, and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Leptospermum cuneiforme is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
