    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense, compact clusters of needle-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and valuable component of wetland and woodland ecosystems."
