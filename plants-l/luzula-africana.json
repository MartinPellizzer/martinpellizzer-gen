    "intro": "Luzula africana, commonly known as African woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically during the cooler months. Luzula africana is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous or coastal regions."
