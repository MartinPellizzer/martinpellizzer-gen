    "intro": "Lathyrus sphaericus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed pods and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
