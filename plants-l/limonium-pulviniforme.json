    "intro": "Limonium pulviniforme, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium pulviniforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal environments."
