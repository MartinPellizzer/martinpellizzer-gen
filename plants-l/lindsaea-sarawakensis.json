    "intro": "Lindsaea sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak mistletoe, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, particularly in Sarawak, where it grows on the trunks and branches of trees. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, small, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Lindsaea sarawakensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy."
