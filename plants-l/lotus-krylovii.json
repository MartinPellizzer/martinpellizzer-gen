    "intro": "Lotus krylovii, commonly known as the Siberian lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshy areas or along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The Siberian lotus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to cold climates and its potential ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
