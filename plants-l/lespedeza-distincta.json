    "intro": "Lespedeza distincta, commonly known as the narrowleaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lespedeza distincta is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
