    "intro": "Libidibia ferrea var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is often used in reforestation efforts."
