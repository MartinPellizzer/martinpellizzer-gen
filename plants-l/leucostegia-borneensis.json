It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers with four to five petals. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
