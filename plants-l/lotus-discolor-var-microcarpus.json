    "intro": "Lotus discolor var. microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited lotus, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the lotus plant. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wetland environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
