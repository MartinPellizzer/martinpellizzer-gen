    "intro": "Laburnum anagyroides f. sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved golden chain, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features elongated, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are smaller and more densely arranged compared to the typical form, with shortened petioles that give the plant its distinctive appearance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its vibrant floral display. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
