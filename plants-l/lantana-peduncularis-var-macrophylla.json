    "intro": "Lantana peduncularis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact shrub form and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
