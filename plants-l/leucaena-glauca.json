    "intro": "Leucaena glauca, commonly known as blue leucaena, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, trifoliate leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Leucaena glauca is also used in agroforestry and for erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardy nature."
