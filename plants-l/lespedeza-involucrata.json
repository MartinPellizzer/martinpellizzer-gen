It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, ascending stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lespedeza involucrata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
