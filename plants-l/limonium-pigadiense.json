    "intro": "Limonium pigadiense, commonly known as the Armenian sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Limonium pigadiense is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
