    "intro": "Lobelia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lobelia dichotoma is valued in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
