    "intro": "Linum dehiscens subsp. crepitans, commonly known as the crackling flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the explosive dehiscence of its seed pods, which release seeds forcefully upon maturity. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
