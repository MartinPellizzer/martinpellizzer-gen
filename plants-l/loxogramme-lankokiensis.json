    "intro": "Loxogramme lankokiensis, commonly known as the Sri Lankan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the wetlands of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Water ferns (Pteridaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Loxogramme lankokiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest for conservation efforts."
