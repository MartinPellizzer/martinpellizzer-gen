It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, edible seeds that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Lepidium fremontii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
