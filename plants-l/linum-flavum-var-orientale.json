    "intro": "Linum flavum var. orientale, commonly known as the Persian flax or golden flax, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for textile production, similar to common flax. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
