    "intro": "Lycopodioides macroclada, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
