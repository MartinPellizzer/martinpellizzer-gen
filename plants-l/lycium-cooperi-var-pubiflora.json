    "intro": "Lycium cooperi var. pubiflora, commonly known as the Desert Willow, is a flowering shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, willow-like branches and produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments, and it is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its flowers attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, making it an ecologically valuable plant. The fruit is a small, red berry that contains several seeds."
