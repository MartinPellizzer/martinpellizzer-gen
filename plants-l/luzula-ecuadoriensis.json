    "intro": "Luzula ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian woodrush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. Native to the Andean regions of Ecuador, it thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems in South America."
