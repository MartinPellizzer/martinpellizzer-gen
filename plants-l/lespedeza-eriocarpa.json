    "intro": "Lespedeza eriocarpa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Hairy lespedeza is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
