    "intro": "Lepidagathis repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaved lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often with a fragrant scent. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Lepidagathis repanda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
