    "intro": "Limniris tenuissima, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's structure consists of a creeping rhizome with small, floating leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the surrounding water. Limniris tenuissima plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
