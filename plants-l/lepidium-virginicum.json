    "intro": "Lepidium virginicum, commonly known as peppergrass, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its small white or yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Peppergrass is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
