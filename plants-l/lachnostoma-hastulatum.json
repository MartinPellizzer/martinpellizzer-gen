    "intro": "Lachnostoma hastulatum, commonly known as the arrowhead lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive arrowhead-shaped lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
