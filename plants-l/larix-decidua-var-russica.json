    "intro": "Larix decidua var. russica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the European larch native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in autumn, which distinguishes it from evergreen larch species. The tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests or groves. Its bark is gray and fissured, and its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in harsh climates."
