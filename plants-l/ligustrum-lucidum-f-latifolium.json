    "intro": "Ligustrum lucidum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf privet, is a shrub native to southeastern China. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark purple berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The broadleaf form is distinguished by its wider leaves, making it visually distinct from other privet varieties."
