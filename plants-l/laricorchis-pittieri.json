    "intro": "Laricorchis pittieri, commonly known as the pine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as pine forests and meadows, where it benefits from the dappled light and well-drained soil. The plant has a single, slender stem that supports a cluster of elongated, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and arranged in a loose inflorescence, giving it a delicate appearance. Laricorchis pittieri is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with pine trees."
