    "intro": "Lyallia andicola, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue. It is adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Lyallia andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
