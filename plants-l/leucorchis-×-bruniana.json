It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
