    "intro": "Lotus tenuifolius var. ramosissimus, commonly known as the fragrant water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in muddy substrates, while its stems are thick and fleshy. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, and the flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
