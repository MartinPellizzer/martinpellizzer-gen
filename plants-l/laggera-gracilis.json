    "intro": "Laggera gracilis, commonly known as slender laggera, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, hairy fruits. Laggera gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
