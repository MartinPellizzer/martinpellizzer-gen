    "intro": "Linaria ramosissima var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
