    "intro": "Leontopodium brachyactis, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers surrounded by a ring of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with alpine landscapes and is considered a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous regions."
