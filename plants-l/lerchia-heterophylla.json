    "intro": "Lerchia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It exhibits a distinct variation in leaf shape and size across different parts of its thallus, which is a characteristic feature of the species. The upper surface of the thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, while the lower surface is darker and often covered with isidiate and rhizinate structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its ecological significance in nutrient cycling and as an indicator of air quality."
