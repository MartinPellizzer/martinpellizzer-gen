    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. leucocarpum, commonly known as white-fruited privet, is a variant of the common privet shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round, white berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and year-round foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
