    "intro": "Lolium, commonly known as grass or ryegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It includes several species that are widely used as forage crops due to their high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. Many Lolium species are characterized by their dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. They are often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils around the world. Some species, like Lolium perenne, are also valued for their ability to suppress weeds and improve soil structure."
