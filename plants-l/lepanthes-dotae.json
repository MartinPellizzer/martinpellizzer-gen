    "intro": "Lepanthes dotae, commonly known as the Dot's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature a combination of white and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Lepanthes dotae has lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
