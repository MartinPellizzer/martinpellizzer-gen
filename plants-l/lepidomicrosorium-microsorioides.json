    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium microsorioides, commonly known as the small fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a fine, waxy layer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its small size and intricate structure, it is a popular subject for botanists and enthusiasts studying fern morphology."
