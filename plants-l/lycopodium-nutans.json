    "intro": "Lycopodium nutans, commonly known as the nodding clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spore-producing organs. Lycopodium nutans typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a key feature of its life cycle."
