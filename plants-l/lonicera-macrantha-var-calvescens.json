It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its berries are orange-red and edible, though often consumed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display."
