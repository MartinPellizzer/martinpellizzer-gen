    "intro": "Licuala bacularia, commonly known as the broad-leafed palm, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, spherical fruits that contain a single seed."
