    "intro": "Lupinus arborescens, commonly known as the tree lupine, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus arborescens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
