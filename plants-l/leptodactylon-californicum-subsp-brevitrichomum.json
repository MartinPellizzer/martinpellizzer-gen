    "intro": "Leptodactylon californicum subsp. brevitrichomum, commonly known as the California feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in loose clusters along the stem. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils."
