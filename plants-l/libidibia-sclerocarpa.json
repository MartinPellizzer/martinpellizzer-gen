    "intro": "Libidibia sclerocarpa, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry savannas and woodlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
