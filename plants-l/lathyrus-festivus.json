    "intro": "Lathyrus festivus, commonly known as the festive vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a slender, climbing stem. Lathyrus festivus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
