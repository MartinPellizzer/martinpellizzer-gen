    "intro": "Lythrum portula subsp. longidentata, commonly known as swamp willow or narrow-leaved lythrum, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, slender stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters tall, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces spikes of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
