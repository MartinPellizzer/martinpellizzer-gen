    "intro": "Lavandula stoechas var. brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed lavender, is a compact, aromatic shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, upright stems and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers, which are smaller and more clustered than those of the common lavender. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is prized for its fragrant foliage and ornamental value in landscaping."
