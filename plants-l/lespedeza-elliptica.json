    "intro": "Lespedeza elliptica, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Lespedeza elliptica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
