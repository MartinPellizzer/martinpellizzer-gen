These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in South America. Lysionotus species are characterized by their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are clustered in umbels or racemes."
