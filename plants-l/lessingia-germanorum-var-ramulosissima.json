    "intro": "Lessingia germanorum var. ramulosissima, commonly known as the ramulose lessingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This variant is distinguished by its particularly branched and ramified growth pattern, which gives it its specific epithet."
