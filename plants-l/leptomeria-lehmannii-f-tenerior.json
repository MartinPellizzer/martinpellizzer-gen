It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
