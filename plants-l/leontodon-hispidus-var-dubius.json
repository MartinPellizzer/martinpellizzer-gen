    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus var. dubius, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is distinguished by its more robust and hairy appearance compared to the typical form of Leontodon hispidus."
