    "intro": "Lactuca dubia, commonly known as the common chicory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue to violet leaves and its tall, branching stems that bear small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its milky sap, which is produced in response to damage. Lactuca dubia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other chicory species."
