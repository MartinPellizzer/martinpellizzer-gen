    "intro": "Litobrochia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
