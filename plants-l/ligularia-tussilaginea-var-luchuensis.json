    "intro": "Ligularia tussilaginea var. luchuensis, commonly known as the Luchuan Ligularia, is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
