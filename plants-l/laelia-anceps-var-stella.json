    "intro": "Laelia anceps var. stella, commonly known as the Stella Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, showy flowers. It features large, fragrant blooms with a white base and deep pink or red markings, often resembling the classic Cattleya orchid. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to flourish. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
