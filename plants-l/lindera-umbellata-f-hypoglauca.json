    "intro": "Lindera umbellata f. hypoglauca, commonly known as the pale-leaf sweet pepper tree, is a variant of the sweet pepper tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, lighter green leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
