    "intro": "Leonurus supinus, commonly known as the creeping horse-leek, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Leonurus supinus is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
