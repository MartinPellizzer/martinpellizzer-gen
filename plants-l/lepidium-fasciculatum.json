    "intro": "Lepidium fasciculatum, commonly known as clustered peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Lepidium fasciculatum is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
