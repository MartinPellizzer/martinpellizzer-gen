    "intro": "Lachanodendron album, commonly known as the white cabbage tree, is a unique plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, white leaves that resemble cabbage leaves, which are covered in a waxy coating. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces edible, apple-like fruits. Due to its distinctive appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
