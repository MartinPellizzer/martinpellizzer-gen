    "intro": "Limnophila viscida, commonly known as swamp willow or water willow, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in clusters. Limnophila viscida thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
