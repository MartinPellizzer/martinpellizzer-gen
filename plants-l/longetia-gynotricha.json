    "intro": "Longetia gynotricha, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Longetia gynotricha is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
