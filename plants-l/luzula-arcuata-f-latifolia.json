It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish to brownish flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
