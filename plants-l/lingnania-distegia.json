    "intro": "Lingnania distegia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
