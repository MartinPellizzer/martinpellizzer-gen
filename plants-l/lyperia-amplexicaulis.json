    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lyeria amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping lyperia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive growth habit, with its leaves tightly clasping the stem, forming a dense, cylindrical structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
