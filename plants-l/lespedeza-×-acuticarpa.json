    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 acuticarpa, commonly known as the Carolina lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability due to symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
