    "intro": "Lankesterella spannageliana, commonly known as the Spanish liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a central axis and leaf-like structures called phyllodes that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the thallus. Lankesterella spannageliana is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of humid, temperate ecosystems."
