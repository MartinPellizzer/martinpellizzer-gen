    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. crassifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems and produces small, violet or blue flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. This variant is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to the typical Lotus corniculatus."
