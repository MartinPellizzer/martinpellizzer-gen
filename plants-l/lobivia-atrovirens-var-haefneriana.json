    "intro": "Lobivia atrovirens var. haefneriana, commonly known as the Haefner's dark green lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globose shape and dark green to almost black stems that are often adorned with white or pale markings. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is a slow-growing species that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled environments."
