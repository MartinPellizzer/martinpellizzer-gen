    "intro": "Loxodon, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the fungal-lichen symbiotic group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on the bark of old trees or on rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a fungal component that provides the main body and a photosynthetic algal partner that produces nutrients through photosynthesis. Loxodon exhibits slow growth and can live for centuries, making it a rare and ancient species. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
