It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, which contrast beautifully with its pale green or blue-gray foliage. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
