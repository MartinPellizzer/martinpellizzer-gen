It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into multiple leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or white, arranged in panicles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
