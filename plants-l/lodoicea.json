    "intro": "Lodoicea, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, leathery leaves. The tree produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and artistic purposes. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to the harsh, arid environment of its native habitat."
