    "intro": "Lactuca runcinata, commonly known as the sharpleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, spiky seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered a weed in some regions but has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
