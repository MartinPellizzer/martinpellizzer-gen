    "intro": "Locheria, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. The plants are evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Locheria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their compact growth and long blooming period. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
