    "intro": "Lomariopsis elongata, commonly known as the elongated fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in small, sori. Lomariopsis elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
