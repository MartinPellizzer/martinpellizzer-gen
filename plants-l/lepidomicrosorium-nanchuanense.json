It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate leaf structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its small, clustered growth habit and unique reproductive features make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
