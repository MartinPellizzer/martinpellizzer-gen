    "intro": "Loranthus loxantherus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, often in clusters, and is pollinated by insects. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
