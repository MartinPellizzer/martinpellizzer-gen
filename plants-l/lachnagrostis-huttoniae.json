    "intro": "Lachnagrostis huttoniae, commonly known as Hutton's grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, tufted clumps of dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and forest margins. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
