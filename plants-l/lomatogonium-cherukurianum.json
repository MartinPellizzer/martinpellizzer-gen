It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Lomatogonium cherukurianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its mountainous habitat."
