    "intro": "Lianthus ellipticifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white to grayish hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Lianthus ellipticifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
