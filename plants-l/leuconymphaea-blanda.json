    "intro": "Leuconymphaea blanda, commonly known as the soft-stemmed water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically light green with a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of still water bodies. Leuconymphaea blanda plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
