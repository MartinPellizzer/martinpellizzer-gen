    "intro": "Lilium pardalinum subsp. pitkinense, commonly known as the Pitkin's lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the high elevations of Colorado. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are generally unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
