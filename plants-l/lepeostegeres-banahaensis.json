    "intro": "Lepeostegeres banahaensis, commonly known as the Banaha fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
