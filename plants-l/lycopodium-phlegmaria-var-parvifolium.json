    "intro": "Lycopodium phlegmaria var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporophytes responsible for releasing spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other varieties within the Lycopodium genus."
