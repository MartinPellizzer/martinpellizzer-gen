    "intro": "Lotus brunneri var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lotus or small lotus, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions of the United States. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, bean-like fruits. Its leaves are finely divided and often float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
