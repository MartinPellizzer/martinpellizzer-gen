    "intro": "Lotus arenarius, commonly known as the sand lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lotus arenarius is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
