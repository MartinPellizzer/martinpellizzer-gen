It is a member of the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are rough and hairy, which is reflected in its scientific name."
