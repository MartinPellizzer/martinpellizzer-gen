    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. multistriata, commonly known as the northern twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to boreal and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. This form is distinguished by its unique leaf venation patterns, which are more prominently striated compared to the typical variety."
