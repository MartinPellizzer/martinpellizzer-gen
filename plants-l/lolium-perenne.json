    "intro": "Lolium perenne, commonly known as perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to purplish in color. Perennial ryegrass is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its rapid establishment and high nutritional value. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions."
