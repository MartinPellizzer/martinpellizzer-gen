    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. sativus, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Sweet clover is also valued for its use in forage and as a green manure crop."
