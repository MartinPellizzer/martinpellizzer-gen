    "intro": "Lupinus decumbens var. argentatus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The silver lupine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
