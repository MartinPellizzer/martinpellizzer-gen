    "intro": "Lycopodioides pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with a rhizome that produces spore-bearing cones. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lycopodioides pumilio plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
