    "intro": "Lampetia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lampetia sarmentosa is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from containers or rockeries."
