    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lilium ledeburii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features tall, narrow leaves and produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.
