    "intro": "Lindernia microcarpaeoides, commonly known as the dwarf lindernia, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale purple to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
