It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its rugged appearance. Lycium prunus-spinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
