It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, blooming throughout the growing season. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. However, it can be invasive in some regions, spreading quickly and outcompeting native vegetation."
