    "intro": "Lotodes patens, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, while its flowers are usually white or pink and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lotodes patens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
