    "intro": "Leontopodium caespitosum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which is surrounded by a cluster of bracts that resemble a crown. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, and the plant is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. Due to its unique appearance and symbolic significance, it is often associated with alpine beauty and resilience."
