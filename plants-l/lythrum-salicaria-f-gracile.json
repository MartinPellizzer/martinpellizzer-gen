    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria f. gracile, commonly known as narrowleaf purple coneflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of deep purple to pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
