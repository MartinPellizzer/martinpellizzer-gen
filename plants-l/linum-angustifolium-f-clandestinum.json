    "intro": "Linum angustifolium f. clandestinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax. It is a rare and lesser-known variant of the flax species, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate blue to purple flowers. This subspecies is typically found in specific, often remote habitats, such as rocky slopes or coastal areas. Its botanical features include a fibrous stem and a short flowering period, usually in spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
