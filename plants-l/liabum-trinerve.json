    "intro": "Liabum trinerve, commonly known as the three-veined liabum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having three distinct veins, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization."
