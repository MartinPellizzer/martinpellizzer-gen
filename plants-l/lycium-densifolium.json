    "intro": "Lycium densifolium, commonly known as denseleaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that ripen in autumn. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. The berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
