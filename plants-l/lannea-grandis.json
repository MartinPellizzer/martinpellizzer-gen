    "intro": "Lannea grandis, commonly known as the African wild rubber tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing a natural defense against herbivores. Lannea grandis is also notable for its ability to produce latex, similar to rubber trees, though it is less commercially exploited. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species."
