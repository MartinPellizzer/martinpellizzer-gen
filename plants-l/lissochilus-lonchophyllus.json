    "intro": "Lissochilus lonchophyllus, commonly known as the long-leaf lissochilus, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
