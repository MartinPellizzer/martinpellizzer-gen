    "intro": "Leuzea pinnatipartita, commonly known as the broadleaf cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Leuzea pinnatipartita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
