It is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a woody cupule. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests. Due to its hard, dense wood, it is valued for timber and has ecological significance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
