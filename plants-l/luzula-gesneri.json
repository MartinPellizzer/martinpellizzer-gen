    "intro": "Luzula gesneri, commonly known as the common wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers. Luzula gesneri is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
