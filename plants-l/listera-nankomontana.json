    "intro": "Listera nankomontana, commonly known as the Nankomontana basketflower, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light and retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listera nankomontana is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
