    "intro": "Leptodactylon pungens var. squarrosum, commonly known as the squarrosum variety of the pungent lepidactylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often glandular leaves, which contribute to its pungent aroma. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation in arid environments."
