    "intro": "Lapiedra, commonly known as stone plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and colorful, star-shaped flowers. The plants are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They have a low-growing habit and are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance. Lapiedra species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ease of care."
