It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Lindera gemmiflora is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
