    "intro": "Lampranthus alboroseus, commonly known as the white-flowered ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
