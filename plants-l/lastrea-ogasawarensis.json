    "intro": "Lastrea ogasawarensis, commonly known as the Ogasawara lastrea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with showy, pinkish-white petals. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with high salinity. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
