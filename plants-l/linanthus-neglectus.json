    "intro": "Linanthus neglectus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Linanthus neglectus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
