It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
