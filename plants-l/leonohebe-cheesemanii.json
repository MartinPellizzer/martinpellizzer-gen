    "intro": "Leonohebe cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's leonohebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Leonohebe cheesemanii is a rare species, with limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations."
