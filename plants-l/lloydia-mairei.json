    "intro": "Lloydia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's lloydia, is a rare and striking member of the Crassulaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers are typically small, clustered in inflorescences, and display a range of colors from white to pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lloydia mairei is considered a species of conservation concern."
