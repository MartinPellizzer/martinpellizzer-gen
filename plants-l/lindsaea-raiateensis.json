    "intro": "Lindsaea raiateensis, commonly known as the Raiatea fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly found in the Cook Islands and French Polynesia. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are often clustered together, forming a compact, mat-like structure. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to tree trunks or other surfaces in its humid, tropical habitat. Lindsaea raiateensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often seen growing on the trunks of native trees in rainforests."
