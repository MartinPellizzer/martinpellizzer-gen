    "intro": "Licuala angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in its natural habitat. The leaves are also used for thatching and as a source of fiber in some regions."
