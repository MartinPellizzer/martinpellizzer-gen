    "intro": "Linnaea borealis var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen and have a leathery texture. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive tubular shape. These flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
