    "intro": "Leucoxylon acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-bearing pods. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a reddish sap when cut. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
