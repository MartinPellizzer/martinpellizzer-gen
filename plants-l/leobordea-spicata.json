    "intro": "Leobordea spicata, commonly known as the spike-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
