It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. It has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
