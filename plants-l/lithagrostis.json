    "intro": "Lithagrostis, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in coastal and maritime environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lithagrostis is well adapted to salty, windy conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping. Its low-growing form makes it an effective plant for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
