    "intro": "Lactuca scariola subsp. virosa, commonly known as the bitterleaf lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its bitterness, it is not commonly cultivated for consumption but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies."
