    "intro": "Lomaria hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf lomariella, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Lomaria hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
