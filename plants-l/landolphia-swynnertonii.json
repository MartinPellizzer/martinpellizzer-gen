    "intro": "Landolphia swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, horn-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, mucilaginous coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
