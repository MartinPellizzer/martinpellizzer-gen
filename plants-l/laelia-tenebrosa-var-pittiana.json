It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle purple hue. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
