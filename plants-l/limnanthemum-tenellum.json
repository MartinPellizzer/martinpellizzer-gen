    "intro": "Limnanthemum tenellum, commonly known as the slender water violet, is a delicate aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces tiny, pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water. Limnanthemum tenellum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and is sometimes used in ornamental water gardens."
