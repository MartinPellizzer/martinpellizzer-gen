    "intro": "Lagynias, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic to animals and humans. They typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, usually pink or white flowers. Lagynias species are often found in disturbed soils and are common in temperate regions. They play an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies."
