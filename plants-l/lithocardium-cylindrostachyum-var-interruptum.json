    "intro": "Lithocardium cylindrostachyum var. interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted cylinder-stemmed lithocardium, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems and narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, red-orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
