    "intro": "Liparis lueri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, lip-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils near pine forests, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a unique ability to absorb moisture through its leaves, which are modified into long, narrow structures. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Liparis lueri is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
