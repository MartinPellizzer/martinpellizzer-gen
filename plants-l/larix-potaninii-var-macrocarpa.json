    "intro": "Larix potaninii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden yellow before falling in autumn. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
