    "intro": "Lucuma moseniana, commonly known as the Mosenian lucuma, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is closely related to the commercially cultivated lucuma (Lucuma lumifera). The plant is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, which is typically harvested when mature, is encased in a thick, leathery exterior and contains edible, sweet, yellow-orange pulp. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Lucuma moseniana is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
