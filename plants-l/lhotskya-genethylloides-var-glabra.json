    "intro": "Lhotskya genethylloides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lhotskya, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its glabrous, or hairless, leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale blue or white color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
