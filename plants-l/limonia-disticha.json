    "intro": "Limonia disticha, commonly known as the Madagascar starfruit or star gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, star-shaped yellow fruits that resemble small citrus fruits. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is edible, though its tart flavor makes it more suitable for culinary use in local cuisines rather than commercial cultivation."
