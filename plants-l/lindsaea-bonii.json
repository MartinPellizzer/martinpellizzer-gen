    "intro": "Lindsaea bonii, commonly known as the Bon's lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for survival. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and can vary in color from bright green to a more muted tone depending on light exposure. Lindsaea bonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
