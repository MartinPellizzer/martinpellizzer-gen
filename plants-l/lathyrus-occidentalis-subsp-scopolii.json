    "intro": "Lathyrus occidentalis subsp. scopolii, commonly known as the western vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with stipules and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for insects."
