    "intro": "Lobivia rossii var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon pink lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a dense covering of short, white spines and produces vibrant pink to salmon-colored flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has a globular or cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent."
