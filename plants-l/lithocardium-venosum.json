    "intro": "Lithocardium venosum, commonly known as the veined lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and colorful flowers. The plant features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. Its flowers are typically small, star-shaped, and come in shades of yellow and orange, blooming during the cooler months. Lithocardium venosum is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient and attractive addition to rock gardens."
