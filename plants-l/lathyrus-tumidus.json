    "intro": "Lathyrus tumidus, commonly known as the inflated vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflated pods, which give it its common name, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Lathyrus tumidus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, where it spreads through its prolific seed production."
