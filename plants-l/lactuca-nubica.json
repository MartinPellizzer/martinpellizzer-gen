    "intro": "Lactuca nubica, commonly known as the mountain lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually small, spoon-shaped, and have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Lactuca nubica is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
