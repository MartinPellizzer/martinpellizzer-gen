    "intro": "Lemonia, commonly known as the lemon tree, is a citrus plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to yellow-orange fruits rich in vitamin C. Lemonia thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its fruit is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its aromatic properties and nutritional value."
