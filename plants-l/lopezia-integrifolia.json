    "intro": "Lopezia integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. It produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lopezia integrifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
