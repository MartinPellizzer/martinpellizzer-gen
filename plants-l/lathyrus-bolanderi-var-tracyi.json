It is a perennial vine that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features slender stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small, pea-shaped, and usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with several small leaflets that help it conserve water in arid environments."
