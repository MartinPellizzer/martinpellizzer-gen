    "intro": "Lophocereus sargentianus, commonly known as the Sargent's organ pipe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lophocereus sargentianus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil."
