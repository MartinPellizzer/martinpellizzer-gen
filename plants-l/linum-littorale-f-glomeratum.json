    "intro": "Linum littorale f. glomeratum, commonly known as sea flax or beach flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
