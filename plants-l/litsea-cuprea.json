    "intro": "Litsea cuprea, commonly known as the red leafed litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-orange leaves, which turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Litsea cuprea thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
