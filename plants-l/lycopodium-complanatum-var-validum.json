    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. validum, commonly known as the flat clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features creeping stems with small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. This variety is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
