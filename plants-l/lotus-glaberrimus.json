    "intro": "Lotus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and waxy, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its roots system helps stabilize the soil and can absorb nutrients from the water. Lotus glaberrimus is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
