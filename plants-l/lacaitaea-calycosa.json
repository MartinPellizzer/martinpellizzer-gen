It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicinal practices. Lacaitaea calycosa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams or in swampy areas."
