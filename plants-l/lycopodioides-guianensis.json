It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodioides guianensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
