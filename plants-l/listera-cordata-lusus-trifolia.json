    "intro": "Listera cordata lusus trifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed basketflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
