It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and produce small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
