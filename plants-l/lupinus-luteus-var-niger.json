    "intro": "Lupinus luteus var. niger, commonly known as black lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking black-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Black lupine is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
