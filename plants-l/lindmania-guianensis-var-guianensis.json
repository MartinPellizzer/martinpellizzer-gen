It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in regions such as Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
