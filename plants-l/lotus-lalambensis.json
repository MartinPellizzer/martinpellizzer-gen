    "intro": "Lotus lalambensis, commonly known as the Malabar lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy pink or red flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. The lotus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in local cultures."
