    "intro": "Ledermanniella letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's ledermanniella, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
