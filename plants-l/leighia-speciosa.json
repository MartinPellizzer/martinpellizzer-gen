    "intro": "Leighia speciosa, commonly known as the orchid of the Andes, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its epiphytic lifestyle. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, Leighia speciosa is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
