It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Lupinus inusitatus is also notable for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
