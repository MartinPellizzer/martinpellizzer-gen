    "intro": "Lactuca serriola subvar. plicata, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a wild plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are edible but can be bitter, and the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
