    "intro": "Lithospermum speciosum, commonly known as showy rock pepper, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy, branched stems that often grow in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The roots of Lithospermum speciosum contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
