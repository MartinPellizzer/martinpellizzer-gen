    "intro": "Lechea maritima var. virginica, commonly known as the Virginica sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in dunes and other sandy habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
