    "intro": "Lonicera japonica hybrida, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
