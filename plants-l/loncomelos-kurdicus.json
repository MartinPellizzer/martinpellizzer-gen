It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is also notable for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some regions for its purported healing benefits."
