It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
