It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves with three sharply toothed lobes and vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. Its root system hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
