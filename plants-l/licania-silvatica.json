It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces a fruit that resembles a cashew apple, though it is not related to the true cashew. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Licania silvatica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
