    "intro": "Lloydia tibetica var. purpurascens, commonly known as the Tibetan lloydia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright purple or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
