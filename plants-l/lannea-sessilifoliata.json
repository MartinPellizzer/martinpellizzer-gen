    "intro": "Lannea sessilifoliata, commonly known as the African wood apple, is a deciduous tree native to East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, orange-red fruits that resemble small apples. Lannea sessilifoliata is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its fruit is an important food source for both wildlife and humans in the region."
