    "intro": "Loasa gilgiana, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Loasa gilgiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils."
