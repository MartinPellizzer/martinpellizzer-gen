    "intro": "Loroglossum calcaratum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Loroglossum calcaratum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
