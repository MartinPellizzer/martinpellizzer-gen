    "intro": "Lepidaploa koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's lepidaploa, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation."
