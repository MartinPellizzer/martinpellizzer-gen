It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive dark red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects attracted to its nectar. Lepanthes andrenoglossa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
