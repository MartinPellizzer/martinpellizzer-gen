    "intro": "Loranthus indicus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of trees. Loranthus indicus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in the canopy of forests."
