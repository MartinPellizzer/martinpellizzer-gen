    "intro": "Lindsaea binervata, commonly known as the two-veined lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Lindsaea binervata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
