    "intro": "Lilium venustum, commonly known as the Persian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, sturdy stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The bulbs of Lilium venustum are edible when young and have a mild, sweet flavor."
