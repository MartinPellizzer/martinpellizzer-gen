    "intro": "Leuconymphaea \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Leuconymphaea minor and Nymphaea tetragona. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water. The hybrid is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
