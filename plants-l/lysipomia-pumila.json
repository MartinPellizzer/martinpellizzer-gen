    "intro": "Lysipomia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lysipomia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Lysipomia pumila is considered a rare and specialized species."
