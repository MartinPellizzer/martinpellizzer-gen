    "intro": "Ligustrum sinense, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring. These are followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in horticulture for its fast growth and dense foliage."
