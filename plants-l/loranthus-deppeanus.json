    "intro": "Loranthus deppeanus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and other hardwoods. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in forested areas."
