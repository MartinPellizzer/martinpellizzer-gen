    "intro": "Linum monogynum var. diffusum, commonly known as wild flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in fiber production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
