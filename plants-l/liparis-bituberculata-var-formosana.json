    "intro": "Liparis bituberculata var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing numerous small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive toothed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
