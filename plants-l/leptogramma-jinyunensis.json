    "intro": "Leptogramma jinyunensis, commonly known as the Jinyun fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with spore-producing soruses located on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
