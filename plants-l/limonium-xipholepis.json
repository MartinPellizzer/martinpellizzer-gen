    "intro": "Limonium xipholepis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Limonium xipholepis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
