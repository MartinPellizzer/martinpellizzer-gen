    "intro": "Liabellum humile, commonly known as the small lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pink or white pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liabellum humile is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
