    "intro": "Lagenaria siceraria var. hispida, commonly known as the rough bottle gourd, is a variant of the bottle gourd species native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, ridged, and spiny exterior, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cylindrical fruits that can grow up to several feet in length, often used for both culinary and practical purposes. Botanically, it belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing features with other gourd species. Its fibrous inner lining and hard outer shell make it unique among its relatives."
