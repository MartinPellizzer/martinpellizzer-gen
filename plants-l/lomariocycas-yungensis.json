    "intro": "Lomariocycas yungensis, commonly known as the Yungens cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
