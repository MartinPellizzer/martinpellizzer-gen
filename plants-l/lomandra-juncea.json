    "intro": "Lomandra juncea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale blue flowers, which are typically borne in summer. Lomandra juncea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or native plant landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, providing erosion control and habitat for native wildlife."
