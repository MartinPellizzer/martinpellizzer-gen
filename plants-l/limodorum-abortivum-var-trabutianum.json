    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum var. trabutianum, commonly known as the Trabut's death's-head orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in shaded and moist environments. Its flowers are usually a deep violet or purple, with intricate patterns that enhance its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
