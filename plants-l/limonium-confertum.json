    "intro": "Limonium confertum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as wind and salt spray. Its succulent leaves are narrow and fleshy, aiding in water retention. Limonium confertum is often used in floral arrangements and is a symbol of resilience due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
