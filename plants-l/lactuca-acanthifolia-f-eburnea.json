    "intro": "Lactuca acanthifolia f. eburnea, commonly known as the silverleaf lettuce, is a botanical variant of the prickly lettuce species. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-veined leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has limited use in culinary applications due to its bitter taste."
