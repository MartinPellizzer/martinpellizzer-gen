    "intro": "Lepanthes otopetala, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes otopetala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
