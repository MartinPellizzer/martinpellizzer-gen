    "intro": "Lepanthopsis kayi, commonly known as the Kay's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, brightly colored petals. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanical research. Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat loss and threats from illegal collection."
