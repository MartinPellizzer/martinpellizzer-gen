    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum var. planiramulosum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features tiny, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
