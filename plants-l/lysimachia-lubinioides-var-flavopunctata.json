    "intro": "Lysimachia lubinioides var. flavopunctata, commonly known as the yellow-spotted loosestrife, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent yellow spots, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
