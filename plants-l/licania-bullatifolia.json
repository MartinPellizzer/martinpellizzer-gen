    "intro": "Licania bullatifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it is less commonly cultivated for its fruit. Licania bullatifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests."
