    "intro": "Loranthus ficivorus, commonly known as the parasitic fig banyan, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of host trees, primarily ficus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by specific insects. Its fruits are fleshy and attract birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if not kept in check."
