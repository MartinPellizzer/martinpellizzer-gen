    "intro": "Lemna minor, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It has no true roots and instead possesses root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. The plant's leaves are tiny, typically less than 1 cm in diameter, and are often mistaken for algae due to their appearance. It reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones. Lemna minor thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
