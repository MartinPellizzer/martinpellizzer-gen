    "intro": "Leymus yiwuensis, commonly known as the Yiwu needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
