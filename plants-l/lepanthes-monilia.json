    "intro": "Lepanthes monilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, deriving its nutrients from the air, water, and debris around it. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with white petals and a distinctive violet or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes monilia is often considered a conservation concern."
