    "intro": "Linociera camptoneura, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to mammals. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique growth habit and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
