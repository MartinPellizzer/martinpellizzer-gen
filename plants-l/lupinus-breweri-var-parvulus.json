    "intro": "Lupinus breweri var. parvulus, commonly known as the small-flowered lupine, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus breweri var. parvulus is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
