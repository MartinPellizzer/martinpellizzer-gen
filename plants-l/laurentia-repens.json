    "intro": "Laurentia repens, commonly known as creeping laurentia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Laurentia repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
