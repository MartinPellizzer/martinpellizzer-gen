    "intro": "Lathyrus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Lathyrus spathulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
