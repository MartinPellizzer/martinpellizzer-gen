    "intro": "Lophiolepis boujartii subsp. boujartii, commonly known as the Boujartii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to brownish in color, and it often contains a mixture of algae and fungi in a symbiotic relationship. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa. This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution and climate changes."
