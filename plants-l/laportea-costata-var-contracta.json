    "intro": "Laportea costata var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its linear, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability."
