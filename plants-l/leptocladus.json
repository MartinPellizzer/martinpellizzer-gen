    "intro": "Leptocladus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Leptocladus species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Their reproductive structures, called strobila, produce spores and are an important feature of their life cycle."
