    "intro": "Lannea welwitschii var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help conserve water in arid conditions. The plant has a distinctive trunk that often develops a thick, cork-like layer to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Lannea welwitschii var. welwitschii is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
