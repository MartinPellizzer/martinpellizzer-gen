    "intro": "Loranthus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are orange or red in color, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland forests."
