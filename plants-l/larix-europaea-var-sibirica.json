    "intro": "Larix europaea var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is lightweight and durable, historically used for construction and furniture. This hardy species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
