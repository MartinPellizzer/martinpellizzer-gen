    "intro": "Loranthus goetzei, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, glossy leaves and white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus goetzei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in ecological interactions with its host species."
