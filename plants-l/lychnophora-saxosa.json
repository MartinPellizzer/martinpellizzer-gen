    "intro": "Lychnophora saxosa, commonly known as the rock lychnophora, is a small shrub native to the rocky habitats of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
