It features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that ripen in the fall and are an important food source for birds.
