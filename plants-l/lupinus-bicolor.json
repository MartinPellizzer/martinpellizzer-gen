It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, typically pink and white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus bicolor is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
