    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium var. flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern ally native to eastern North America. It features dense, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its flexible, arching stems that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance."
