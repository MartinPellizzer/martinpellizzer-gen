    "intro": "Leontodon pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks, often forming dense mats. Leontodon pectinatus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
