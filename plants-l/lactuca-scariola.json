    "intro": "Lactuca scariola, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a rosette of spiny, hairy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lactuca scariola is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
