    "intro": "Leucojum autumnale var. diphyllum, commonly known as the autumn snowflake, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in the fall. The plant is characterized by its two distinct leaf forms, hence the varietal name *diphyllum*. It thrives in woodland or shaded garden settings and is valued for its early blooming habit. The flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
