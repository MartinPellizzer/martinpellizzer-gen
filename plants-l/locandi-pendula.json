    "intro": "Locandi pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall before shedding. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, ponds, and wetlands. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds."
