    "intro": "Lithops hermetica, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. During the growing season, it produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers. Its unique appearance and ability to blend into its surroundings make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
