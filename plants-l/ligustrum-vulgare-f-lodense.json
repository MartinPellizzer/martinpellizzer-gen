    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. lodense, commonly known as the dense privet, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form thick hedges. This variety is particularly noted for its dense foliage, making it a popular choice for privacy screens and ornamental purposes."
