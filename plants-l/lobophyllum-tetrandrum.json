    "intro": "Lobophyllum tetrandrum, commonly known as the red sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in shallow marine environments. Lobophyllum tetrandrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow in challenging coastal conditions."
