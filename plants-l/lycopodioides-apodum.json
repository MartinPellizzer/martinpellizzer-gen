    "intro": "Lycopodioides apodum, commonly known as the naked clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones. It is a primitive vascular plant that lacks true leaves and instead has microphylls, which are simple, needle-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered in strobili, which produce spores for propagation. Lycopodioides apodum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
