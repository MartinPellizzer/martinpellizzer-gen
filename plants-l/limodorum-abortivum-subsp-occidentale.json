    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the western adder's mouth, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
