    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, slender growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline, tolerating salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny spikelets. Sea bentgrass plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
