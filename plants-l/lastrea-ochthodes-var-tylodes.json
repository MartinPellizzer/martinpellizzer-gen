It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features fuzzy, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand coastal conditions, it is a resilient species adapted to harsh maritime climates."
