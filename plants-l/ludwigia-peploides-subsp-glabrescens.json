    "intro": "Ludwigia peploides subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth ludwigia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
