    "intro": "Ligusticum verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered devil's tongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, upright stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and often branched, contributing to its hardiness in rocky soils. Ligusticum verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
