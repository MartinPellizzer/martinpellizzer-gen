    "intro": "Lepanthes lupula, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers with a prominent lip that is often tinged with purple or brown. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Lepanthes lupula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
