    "intro": "Lonchostoma pentandrum, commonly known as the five-stamen bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in North America and parts of Europe. It has five stamens and a distinctive, spurred flower that aids in pollination. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
