    "intro": "Lobelia capillifolia var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds via wind. This variant is closely related to the more common Lobelia capillifolia, but its unique appearance and habitat preferences distinguish it."
