    "intro": "Lepidium tournefortii, commonly known as desert cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its fruit is a small, cylindrical silique that contains several seeds. Lepidium tournefortii is adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland environments."
