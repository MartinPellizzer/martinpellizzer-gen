It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow and pinnately compound, with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
