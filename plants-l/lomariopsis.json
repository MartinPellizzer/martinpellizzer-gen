These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in mountainous areas. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Lomariopsis species typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce capsules as their fruit. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
