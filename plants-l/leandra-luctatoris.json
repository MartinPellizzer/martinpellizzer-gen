    "intro": "Leandra luctatoris, commonly known as the sorrowful orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that bloom in shades of pale purple and white. The plant has slender, wiry stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leandra luctatoris is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
