    "intro": "Lonicera villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in early spring, which are visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans."
