    "intro": "Lotodes tenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers have a short lifespan, typically opening in the morning and closing by midday."
