    "intro": "Lycopodium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces spores in clusters called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium tibeticum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
