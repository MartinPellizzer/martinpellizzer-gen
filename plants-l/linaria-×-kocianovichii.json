    "intro": "Linaria \u00d7 kocianovichii, commonly known as the hybrid common toadflax, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its erect growth habit and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers in raceme-like clusters, which are typical of the Linaria genus. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
