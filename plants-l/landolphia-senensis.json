    "intro": "Landolphia senensis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. Landolphia senensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
