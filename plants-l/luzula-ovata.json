    "intro": "Luzula ovata, commonly known as the narrowleaf woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers. Luzula ovata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, often forming dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
