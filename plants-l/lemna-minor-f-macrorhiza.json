    "intro": "Lemna minor f. macrorhiza, commonly known as the giant water flea, is a variant of the common duckweed. It is a small, free-floating aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves and prominent, often reddish, rhizomes. This species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. The plant's simple morphology and reproductive strategy contribute to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
