    "intro": "Luzula maxima var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf woodrush, is a perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, often arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense ground cover. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
