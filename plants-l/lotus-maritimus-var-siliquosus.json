    "intro": "Lotus maritimus var. siliquosus, commonly known as the sea lotus, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is robust, allowing it to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It is often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and tidal flats along the coasts of Europe and Asia."
