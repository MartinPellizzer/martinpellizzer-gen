It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Latipes plays an important role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
