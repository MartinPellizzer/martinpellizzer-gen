It features glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
