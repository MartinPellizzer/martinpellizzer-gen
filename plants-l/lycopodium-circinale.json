    "intro": "Lycopodium circinale, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Lycopodium circinale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground cover."
