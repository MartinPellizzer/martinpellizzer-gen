    "intro": "Lomariocycas moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
