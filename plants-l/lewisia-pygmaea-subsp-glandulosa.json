    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in small glands, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
