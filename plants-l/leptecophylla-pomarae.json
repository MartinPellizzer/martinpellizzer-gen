    "intro": "Leptecophylla pomarae, commonly known as the Pomara's leathery fern, is a unique plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often crinkled fronds that exhibit a range of colors from green to reddish-brown. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in areas with high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specialized habitat, Leptecophylla pomarae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
