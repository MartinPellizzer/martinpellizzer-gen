    "intro": "Lamium longiflorum, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and the plant is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Lamium longiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
