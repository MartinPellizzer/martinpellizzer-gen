It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Lefebvrea kupensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
