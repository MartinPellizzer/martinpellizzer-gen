    "intro": "Lithospermum cornutum, commonly known as the horned rock pepper, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant produces distinctive, horn-like structures on its fruit, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. Lithospermum cornutum is adapted to rocky, arid environments and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
