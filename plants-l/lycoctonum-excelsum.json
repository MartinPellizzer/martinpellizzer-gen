    "intro": "Lycoctonum excelsum, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation despite its ornamental appeal."
