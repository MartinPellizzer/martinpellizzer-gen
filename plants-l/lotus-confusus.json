    "intro": "Lotus confusus, commonly known as the confused water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are pale yellow to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in the early morning. Lotus confusus is known for its ability to thrive in still or gently flowing water, making it a common sight in wetland environments."
