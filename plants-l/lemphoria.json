    "intro": "Lemphoria, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that belongs to the genus Dendrophylax, characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Lemphoria is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
