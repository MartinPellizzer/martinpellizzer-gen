    "intro": "Lotus campylocladus, commonly known as the mountain lotus, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and its unique, spiraling leaf structure. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky, forested areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
