    "intro": "Lomagramma pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often grow close to the ground. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Lomagramma pedicellata is often found in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions."
