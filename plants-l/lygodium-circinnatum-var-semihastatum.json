    "intro": "Lygodium circinnatum var. semihastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and a unique growth habit that allows it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in compact, spore-bearing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinct, slightly asymmetrical shape. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
