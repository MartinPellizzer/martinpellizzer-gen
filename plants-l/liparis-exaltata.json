It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the acidic soils of its habitat. Liparis exaltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
