    "intro": "Leucospora, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white or pale flowers that open at night and close during the day. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Leucospora species are native to various regions in the Americas, including Mexico and the Caribbean. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves."
