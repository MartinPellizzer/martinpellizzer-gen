    "intro": "Leymus innovatus, commonly known as the innovative oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Leymus innovatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its seeds are small and produce a fluffy, wind-dispersed crown that aids in its propagation."
