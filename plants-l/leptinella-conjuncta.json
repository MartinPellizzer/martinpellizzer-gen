    "intro": "Leptinella conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. Leptinella conjuncta is an important component of alpine plant communities and is often found in meadows and talus slopes."
