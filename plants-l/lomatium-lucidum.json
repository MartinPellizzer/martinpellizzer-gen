    "intro": "Lomatium lucidum, commonly known as golden lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples. Lomatium lucidum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
