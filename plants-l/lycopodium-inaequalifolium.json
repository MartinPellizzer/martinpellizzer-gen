    "intro": "Lycopodium inaequalifolium, commonly known as the unequal-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, typical of its ancient lineage of vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique leaf morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
