It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy, yellow-centered flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is often protected in its native habitats."
