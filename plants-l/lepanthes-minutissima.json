    "intro": "Lepanthes minutissima, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments within forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white or pale pink blossoms. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
