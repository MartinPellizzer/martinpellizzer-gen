    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. amphicarpos, commonly known as the twin-seeded vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated pods containing two seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
