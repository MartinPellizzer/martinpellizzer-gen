    "intro": "Leptospermum macrocarpum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in heathlands and coastal dunes. Leptospermum macrocarpum is valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
