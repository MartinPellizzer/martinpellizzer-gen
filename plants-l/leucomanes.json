    "intro": "Leucomanes, commonly known as false hellebore, are perennial herbaceous plants belonging to the family Araceae. They are characterized by their thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often green with a white or yellowish midrib. The plant produces umbellate inflorescences with small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spathe. Leucomanes are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are also known for their toxicity, containing compounds such as cycloalkyl compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
