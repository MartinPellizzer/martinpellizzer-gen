    "intro": "Leea sambucina var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable elderleaf, is a botanical variant of the elderleaf plant, characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape. It is a perennial shrub native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that can range from ovate to elliptic in shape, depending on the specific variety. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its variability, it is often studied for its potential in horticulture and ecological applications."
