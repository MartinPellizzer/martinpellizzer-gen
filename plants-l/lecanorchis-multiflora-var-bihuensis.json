    "intro": "Lecanorchis multiflora var. bihuensis, commonly known as the Bihu orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in cool, humid environments, often found in shaded forest floors. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with a unique, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It has a short, creeping rhizome and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
