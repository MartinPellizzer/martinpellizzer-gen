    "intro": "Liriope muscari f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lilyturf, is a variant of the common lilyturf that features striking white flowers instead of the typical purple or blue. It is a clump-forming perennial herb native to East Asia, characterized by its grass-like foliage and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its elegant appearance. Its botanical features include narrow, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
