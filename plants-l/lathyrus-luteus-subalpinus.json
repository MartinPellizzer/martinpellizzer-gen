    "intro": "Lathyrus luteus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
