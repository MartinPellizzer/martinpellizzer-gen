    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that differ from the typical ovate leaves of the species. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters of two. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
