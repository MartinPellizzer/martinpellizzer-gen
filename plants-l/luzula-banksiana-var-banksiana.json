    "intro": "Luzula banksiana var. banksiana, commonly known as the Banks' wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Luzula banksiana var. banksiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
