    "intro": "Lysimachia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky willow or goldenthread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have glandular dots that give the plant its common name. Lysimachia glandulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
