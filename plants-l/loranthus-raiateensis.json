    "intro": "Loranthus raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pink flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for birds and insects. However, it can also be detrimental to its host tree if it becomes too dense."
