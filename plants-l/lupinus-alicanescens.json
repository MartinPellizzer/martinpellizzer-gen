    "intro": "Lupinus alicanescens, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Lupinus alicanescens is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
