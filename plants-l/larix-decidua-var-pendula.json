    "intro": "Larix decidua var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a unique variety of the European larch. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive, weeping appearance. This coniferous tree is native to the Alps and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its needles are needle-like and remain on the tree for several years before shedding. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
