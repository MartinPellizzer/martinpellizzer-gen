It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a starchy, edible pulp. The plant is part of the Sapotaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. Its bark and seeds have been used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its ecological role within tropical forests."
