    "intro": "Lupinus falsograyi, commonly known as the false gray lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus falsograyi plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
