    "intro": "Limnia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Limnia parviflora plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water ecosystems."
