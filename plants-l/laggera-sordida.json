    "intro": "Laggera sordida, commonly known as the bitterleaf or stinking weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which contributes to its common name. Laggera sordida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
