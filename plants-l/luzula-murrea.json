It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-rowed flowers, which are typically green to purplish in color. Luzula murrea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds to its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
