    "intro": "Leymus simplex var. luxurians, commonly known as the common wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically a bright green color. It blooms with spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. This versatile grass is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
