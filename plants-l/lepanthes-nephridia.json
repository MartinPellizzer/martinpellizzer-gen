    "intro": "Lepanthes nephridia, commonly known as the kidney-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. The orchid's flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and moths."
