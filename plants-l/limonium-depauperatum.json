It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its small, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Limonium depauperatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray."
