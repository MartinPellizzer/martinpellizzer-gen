    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. geniculatum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a variant of perennial ryegrass characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a useful plant for erosion control and as a forage crop."
