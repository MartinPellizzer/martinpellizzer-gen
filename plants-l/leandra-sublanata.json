    "intro": "Leandra sublanata, commonly known as the velvetleaf leandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Leandra sublanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its aesthetic qualities."
