It is characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
