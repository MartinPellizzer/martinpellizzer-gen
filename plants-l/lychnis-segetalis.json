    "intro": "Lychnis segetalis, commonly known as the field catchfly, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features simple, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink or red petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lychnis segetalis is often found in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
