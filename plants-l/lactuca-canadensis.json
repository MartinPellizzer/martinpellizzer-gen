    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis, commonly known as Canadian lettuce, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woods. Canadian lettuce is also known for its milky sap, which is released when the stems or leaves are broken."
