    "intro": "Licaria armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian licorice, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Despite its name, it is not closely related to true licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.) and is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal."
