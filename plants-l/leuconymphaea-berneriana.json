    "intro": "Leuconymphaea berneriana, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective choice for covering trellises or walls in ornamental gardening."
