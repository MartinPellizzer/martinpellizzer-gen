    "intro": "Loranthus conradsii, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and elms. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
