    "intro": "Leucostele rivierei, commonly known as the Rivi\u00e8re's leucostele, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
