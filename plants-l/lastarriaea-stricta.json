    "intro": "Lastarriaea stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf lastarriaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
