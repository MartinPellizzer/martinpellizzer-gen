    "intro": "Liparis cumingii, commonly known as Cuming's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, often with a faint fragrance. Liparis cumingii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
