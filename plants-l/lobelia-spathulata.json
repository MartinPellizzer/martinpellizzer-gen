    "intro": "Lobelia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, ovate to spatulate-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in natural habitats."
