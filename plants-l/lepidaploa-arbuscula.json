    "intro": "Lepidaploa arbuscula, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its adaptability to different climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
