It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its pale yellow to white flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Lyperia pallida is notable for its small, linear leaves and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
