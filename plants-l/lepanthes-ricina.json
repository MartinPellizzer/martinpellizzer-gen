    "intro": "Lepanthes ricina, commonly known as the red-bellied stebbinsia, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a deep red or orange coloration on the lip. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Lepanthes ricina thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
