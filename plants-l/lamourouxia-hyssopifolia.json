    "intro": "Lamourouxia hyssopifolia, commonly known as the mountain hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, arranged in spikes along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Lamourouxia hyssopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
