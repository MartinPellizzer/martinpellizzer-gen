    "intro": "Lycopodium inundatum f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss genus Lycopodium. It is characterized by its distinctive, forked spore cones, which set it apart from other members of the genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytic structures are prominent, with the strobila bearing the spores in clusters. This fern-like plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
