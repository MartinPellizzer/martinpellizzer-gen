    "intro": "Loeseneriella crenata var. rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained sea holly, is a rare coastal plant found in specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its varietal name, *rubiginosa*, refers to the reddish discoloration that appears on its leaves, likely due to environmental factors. This plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
