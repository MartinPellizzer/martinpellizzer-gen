    "intro": "Lappa rosacea, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and it is known for its toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Lappa rosacea is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks."
