    "intro": "Lycopodium veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the spores, which are released upon maturity. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
