    "intro": "Lotodes campestre, commonly known as the meadow water flea, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Lotodes campestre plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
