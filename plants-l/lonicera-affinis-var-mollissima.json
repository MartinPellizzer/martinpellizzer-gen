    "intro": "Lonicera affinis var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow-orange flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are red and edible, ripen in the fall and provide food for birds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
