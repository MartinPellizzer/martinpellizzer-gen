    "intro": "Liabum bullatum, commonly known as the bullate liabum, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
