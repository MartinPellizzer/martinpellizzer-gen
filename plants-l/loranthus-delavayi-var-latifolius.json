    "intro": "Loranthus delavayi var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a leathery texture, and it is commonly found in mountainous regions of China. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, while also influencing the growth of its host trees."
