    "intro": "Lathyrus inconspicuus var. inconspicuus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems covered in small, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, blooming in early summer. Its fruit is a hairy pod containing several oval, dark brown seeds. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
