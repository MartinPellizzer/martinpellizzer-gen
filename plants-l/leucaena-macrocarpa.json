    "intro": "Leucaena macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It is often cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing ability and as a forage crop for livestock. Leucaena macrocarpa is also valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
