    "intro": "Lyrolepis, commonly known as the stonecrop or sedum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, often succulent leaves and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. Lyrolepis species are native to temperate and arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Many species are popular in horticulture due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
