    "intro": "Littorella, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in coastal environments. It forms dense, flat, green mats on the surfaces of rocks and tidal pools. This plant is characterized by its simple, blade-like structure and lack of true roots, stems, or leaves. Littorella plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
