    "intro": "Lotus tetragonolobus, commonly known as the four-angled lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its square, angular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
