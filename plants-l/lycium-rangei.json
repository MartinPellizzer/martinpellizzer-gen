    "intro": "Lycium rangei, commonly known as the desert gooseberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically pale yellow, and it produces fruit that is edible, though often tart. Lycium rangei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and serving as a potential source of medicinal compounds."
