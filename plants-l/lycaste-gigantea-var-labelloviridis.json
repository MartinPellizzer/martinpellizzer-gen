It is characterized by its large, thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant green foliage with a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It blooms with showy, fragrant flowers that range from yellow to orange, typically during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and arid garden environments."
