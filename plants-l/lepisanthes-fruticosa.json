    "intro": "Lepisanthes fruticosa, commonly known as the purple-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
