    "intro": "Ligustrum novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea privet, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans and domestic animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability. Ligustrum novoguineense is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical climates."
