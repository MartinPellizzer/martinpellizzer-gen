It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, branched inflorescences. Lupinus paniculatus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
