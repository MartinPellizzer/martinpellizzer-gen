    "intro": "Linaria michauxii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. Linaria michauxii typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient member of its ecosystem."
