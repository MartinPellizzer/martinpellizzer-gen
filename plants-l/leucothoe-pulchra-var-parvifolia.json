    "intro": "Leucothoe pulchra var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet-blue berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
