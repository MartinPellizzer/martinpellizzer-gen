    "intro": "Limnochloa baeothryon var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant typically has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across aquatic surfaces. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikes, and it blooms during the wet season. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize aquatic environments."
