    "intro": "Lobelia minuta var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it an excellent addition to shaded rock gardens or as a ground cover."
