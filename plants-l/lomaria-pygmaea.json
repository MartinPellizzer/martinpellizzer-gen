It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
