It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, usually featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. It has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid climate. Laelia elata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
