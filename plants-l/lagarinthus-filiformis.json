    "intro": "Lagarinthus filiformis, commonly known as the slender leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a decorative vine. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
