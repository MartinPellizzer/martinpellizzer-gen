    "intro": "Lepanthes cornejoi, commonly known as the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands in Chile. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small size and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes."
