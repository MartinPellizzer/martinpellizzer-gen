    "intro": "Leionema lamprophyllum subsp. fractum, commonly known as the silverleaf leionema, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is generally considered a minor weed in natural environments."
