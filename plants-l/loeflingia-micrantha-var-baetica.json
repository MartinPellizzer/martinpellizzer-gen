    "intro": "Loeflingia micrantha var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetica variety of the narrow-leaved loeflingia, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces umbels of tiny white or greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
