    "intro": "Lysiostyles scandens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved climbing lysiostyle, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, climbing stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and adaptability to humid, low-light conditions."
