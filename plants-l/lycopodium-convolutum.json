    "intro": "Lycopodium convolutum, commonly known as the twisted clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili. It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with stems that can be either prostrate or ascending. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, and it produces spores in specialized cones rather than flowers. Lycopodium convolutum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
