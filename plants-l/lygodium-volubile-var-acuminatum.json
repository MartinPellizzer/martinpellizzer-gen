    "intro": "Lygodium volubile var. acuminatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its coiled, fiddlehead-like young fronds and its ability to climb using its wiry rhizomes. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
