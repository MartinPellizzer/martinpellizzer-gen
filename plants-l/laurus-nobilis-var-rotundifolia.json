    "intro": "Laurus nobilis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the bay leaf tree or Turkish bay laurel, is a variant of the bay laurel species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are darker and more leathery compared to the standard bay leaf. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used historically for culinary and medicinal purposes. The flowers are small and yellowish-green, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but less commonly consumed."
