    "intro": "Lobivia pentlandii var. hardeniana, commonly known as the Hardy Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a rounded, ribbed stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
