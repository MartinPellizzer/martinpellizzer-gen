It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery-white appearance due to a fine layer of wax on the leaves. The plant produces cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
