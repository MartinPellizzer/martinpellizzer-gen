    "intro": "Lepanthes renipetala, commonly known as the red-bellied orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a bright red or orange lip, which is a key feature in attracting pollinators. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Lepanthes renipetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral displays."
