    "intro": "Lactuca nana, commonly known as dwarf lettuce, is a short-lived annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with a rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in a loose cluster at the top of the stem, which are followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Lactuca nana is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
