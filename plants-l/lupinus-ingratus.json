    "intro": "Lupinus ingratus, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Lupinus ingratus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
