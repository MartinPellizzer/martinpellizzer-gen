    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lypertia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky lypertia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of blue-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a distinctive botanical feature, likely serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Lypertia glutinosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments."
