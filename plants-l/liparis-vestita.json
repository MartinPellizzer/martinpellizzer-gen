    "intro": "Liparis vestita, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is an orchid species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Liparis vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
