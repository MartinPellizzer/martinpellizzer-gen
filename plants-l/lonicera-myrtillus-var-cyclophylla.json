    "intro": "Lonicera myrtillus var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the red-berried honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
