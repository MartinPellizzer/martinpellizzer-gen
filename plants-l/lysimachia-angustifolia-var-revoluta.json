    "intro": "Lysimachia angustifolia var. revoluta, commonly known as the narrowleaf yellowcrown, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, ascending stems covered with opposite, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive revolute (curled under) margin. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
