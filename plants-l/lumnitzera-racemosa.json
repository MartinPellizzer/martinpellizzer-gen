    "intro": "Lumnitzera racemosa, commonly known as the mangrove swamp shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize soil and filter water, making it vital for coastal ecosystems. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Lumnitzera racemosa plays a key role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
