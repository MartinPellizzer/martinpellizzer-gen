It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. The varietal name \"albicomans\" refers to the white-tipped bracts that distinguish this form from other varieties of Luzula rufa."
