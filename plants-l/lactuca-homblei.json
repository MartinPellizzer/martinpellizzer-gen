    "intro": "Lactuca homblei, commonly known as Hombli's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into fluffy, white seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Lactuca homblei is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
