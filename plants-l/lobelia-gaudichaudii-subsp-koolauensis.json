    "intro": "Lobelia gaudichaudii subsp. koolauensis, commonly known as the Koolau lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's ecological conditions."
