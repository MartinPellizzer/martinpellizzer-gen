    "intro": "Lelya prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate lelya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Lelya prostrata is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
