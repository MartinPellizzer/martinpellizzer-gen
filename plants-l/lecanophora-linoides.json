    "intro": "Lecanophora linoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some regions."
