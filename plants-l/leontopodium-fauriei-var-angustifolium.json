    "intro": "Leontopodium fauriei var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved edelweiss, is a rare and protected alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a thick layer of silky hairs, which help to insulate it from the cold and reduce water loss. It is often found in association with other alpine flora and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
