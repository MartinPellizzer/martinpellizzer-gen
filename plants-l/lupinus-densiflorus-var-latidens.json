It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of showy, blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.
