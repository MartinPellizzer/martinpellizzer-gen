    "intro": "Linum viscosum f. sylvestre, commonly known as wild flax, is a variant of the flax plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it a distinctive texture. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in textile production."
