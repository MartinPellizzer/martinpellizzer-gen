    "intro": "Lotus commutatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores being the primary means of propagation. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to wetland habitats make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
