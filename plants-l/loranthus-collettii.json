    "intro": "Loranthus collettii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kahikatea. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is an important component of the forest ecosystem, providing food for birds and insects. Loranthus collettii is also culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people."
