    "intro": "Lycopodium serpentiforme, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curling fronds that resemble a serpent, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodium serpentiforme plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
