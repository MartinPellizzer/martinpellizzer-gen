    "intro": "Lithodora prostrata, commonly known as creeping bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, making it suitable for ground cover. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Lithodora prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
