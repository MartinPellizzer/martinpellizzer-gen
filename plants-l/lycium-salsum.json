    "intro": "Lycium salsum, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Lycium salsum is often found in saline soils and can tolerate high levels of salt, making it a valuable plant for reclamation projects. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and sustainable land management."
