    "intro": "Lycaste crocea, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are typically green with prominent red veins. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a yellow or orange lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Lycaste crocea is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
