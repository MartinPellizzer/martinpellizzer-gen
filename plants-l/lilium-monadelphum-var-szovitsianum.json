    "intro": "Lilium monadelphum var. szovitsianum, commonly known as the Szovits' lily, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive white throat and a broad, recurved tepal arrangement. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
