    "intro": "Lucinaea ramiflora var. pubinervis, commonly known as the pubescent-veined woodbine, is a perennial climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside. The flowers are small, white to pink, and borne in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its pubescent (hairy) veins give it its botanical variety name, pubinervis."
