    "intro": "Leymus triticoides subsp. simplex, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, wiry texture and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe. It is adapted to arid environments and has deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
