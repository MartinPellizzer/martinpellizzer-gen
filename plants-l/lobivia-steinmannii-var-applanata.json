    "intro": "Lobivia steinmannii var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its otherwise muted appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The varietal form 'applanata' distinguishes it by its flatter, broader leaves compared to other varieties of Lobivia steinmannii."
