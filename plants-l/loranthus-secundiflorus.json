    "intro": "Loranthus secundiflorus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Its presence can influence the health and diversity of its host trees."
