It is characterized by its erect stems and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or mountainous areas. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
