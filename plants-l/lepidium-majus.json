    "intro": "Lepidium majus, commonly known as peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are small and covered in a distinctive, pitted surface, which aids in their dispersal by wind and animals."
