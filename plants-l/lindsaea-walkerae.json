    "intro": "Lindsaea walkerae, commonly known as the Walker's spikemoss, is a tropical fern ally native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its erect, spiky stems and dense, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Lindsaea walkerae is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
