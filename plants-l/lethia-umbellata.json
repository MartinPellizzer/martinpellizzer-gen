    "intro": "Lethia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that forms a dense, cushion-like growth. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is covered in small, rounded lobes that resemble an umbrella. This lichen typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. It is known for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. The structure of Lethia umbellata supports a diverse community of microorganisms, making it ecologically significant in forest ecosystems."
