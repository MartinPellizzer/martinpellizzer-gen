    "intro": "Lobelia chamaepitys var. ceratophylla, commonly known as the woolly lobelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it an important species for supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity."
