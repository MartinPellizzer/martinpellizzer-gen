    "intro": "Loxogramme remote-frondigera, commonly known as the slender fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Loxogrammaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
