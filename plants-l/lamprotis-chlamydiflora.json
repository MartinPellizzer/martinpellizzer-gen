    "intro": "Lamprotis chlamydiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
