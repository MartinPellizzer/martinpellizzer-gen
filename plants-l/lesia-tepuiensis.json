    "intro": "Lesia tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui lesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of these high-altitude tabletop mountains, where it adapts to low oxygen levels and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually large and thick, aiding in water retention in the arid conditions of its habitat. Lesia tepuiensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties."
