    "intro": "Lomandra hermaphrodita, commonly known as the common lomandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which consists of narrow, strap-shaped leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Lomandra hermaphrodita is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
