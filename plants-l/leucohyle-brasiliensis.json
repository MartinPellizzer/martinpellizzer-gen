    "intro": "Leucohyle brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it highly sensitive to habitat disruption. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority."
