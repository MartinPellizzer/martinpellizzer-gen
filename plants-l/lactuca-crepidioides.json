It is characterized by its rosette of broad, wavy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, spherical seed heads. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky soils. It is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
