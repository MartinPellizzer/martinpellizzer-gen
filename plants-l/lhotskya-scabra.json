    "intro": "Lhotskya scabra, commonly known as the rough lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the substrate, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark grey, with a granular texture that gives it a rough appearance. It contains a mix of photobionts, primarily green algae, and is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites. This lichen is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
