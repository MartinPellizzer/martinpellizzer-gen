    "intro": "Lycopodium selago f. patens, commonly known as the trailing clubmoss, is a fern ally plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen herb that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is characterized by its spreading growth habit, making it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions."
