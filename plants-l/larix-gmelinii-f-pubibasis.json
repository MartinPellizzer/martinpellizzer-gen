    "intro": "Larix gmelinii f. pubibasis, commonly known as the Siberian larch with pubescent base, is a unique form of the Siberian larch. It is characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) base on the young shoots, which sets it apart from the typical form. This plant is native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that produces cone-like structures for seed dispersal. The botanical features of this form are of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and variation in extreme environments."
