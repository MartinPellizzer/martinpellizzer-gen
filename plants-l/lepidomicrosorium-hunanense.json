    "intro": "Lepidomicrosorium hunanense, commonly known as the Hunan moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to China. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate leaf structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its small, closely packed leaves are covered in minute, scale-like structures that aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
