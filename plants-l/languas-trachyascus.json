    "intro": "Languas trachyascus, commonly known as the rough-hair lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its crust-like thallus, which is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen exhibits a distinctive, uneven surface with a rough, granular texture, giving it its common name. It is typically pale yellow to orange in color and can be found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. This lichen is an important indicator species for environmental conditions and is often used in ecological studies."
