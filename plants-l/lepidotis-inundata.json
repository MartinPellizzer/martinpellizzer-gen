    "intro": "Lepidotis inundata, commonly known as the water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the family Nychthemeral, and its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that repels water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Lepidotis inundata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
