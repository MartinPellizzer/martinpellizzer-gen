    "intro": "Lotus angivensis, commonly known as the African water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking pink or purple flowers bloom above the water. Lotus angivensis has a robust root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in some cultures."
