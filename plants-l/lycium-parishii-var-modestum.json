    "intro": "Lycium parishii var. modestum, commonly known as the slender boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters and features small, spiny leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter or early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for humans and birds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
