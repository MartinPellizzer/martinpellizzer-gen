It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lysimachia attenuata is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread through rhizomes."
