    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus opaca, commonly known as the black cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and showy white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Lauro-cerasus opaca plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
