    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. trichophyllum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces spore-bearing strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporophytic structure consists of a stem with whorled leaves and specialized cones for spore production. This variety is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
