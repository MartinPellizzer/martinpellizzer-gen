    "intro": "Lagarosiphon steudneri, commonly known as the African frog's-bit, is a semi-aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and it produces small, green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and sometimes submerged, while its floating leaves are usually broader. Lagarosiphon steudneri is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in non-native habitats."
