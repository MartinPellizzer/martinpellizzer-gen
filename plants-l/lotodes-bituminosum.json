    "intro": "Lotodes bituminosum, commonly known as the bituminous water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and yellow, emerging from the water surface, and it produces distinctive, oily seeds. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
