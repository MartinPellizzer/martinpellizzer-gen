    "intro": "Lyonia rubiginosa, commonly known as the redroot honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its roots are reddish in color, which gives the species its common name. Lyonia rubiginosa is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat."
