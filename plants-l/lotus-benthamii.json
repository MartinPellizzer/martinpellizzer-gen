    "intro": "Lotus benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Lotus benthamii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in aquatic botany."
