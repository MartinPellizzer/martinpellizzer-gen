    "intro": "Lycopodium henryanum, commonly known as the Chilean clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and sporangia that produce spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of its stems, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Lycopodium henryanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in specific environmental conditions."
