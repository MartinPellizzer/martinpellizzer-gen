    "intro": "Lysiostyles, commonly known as ghost orchids, are rare epiphytic plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are characterized by their delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. These plants lack true leaves and instead absorb nutrients through their roots, which are often found on tree bark. Lysiostyles thrive in humid, shaded environments and require specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are now endangered."
