    "intro": "Leucaena leucocephala subsp. leucocephala, commonly known as the white-flowered leucaena, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and clusters of white, spherical flower heads. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry and forage production. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
