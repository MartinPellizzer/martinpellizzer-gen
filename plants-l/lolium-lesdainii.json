The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Lolium lesdainii is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential for agricultural use."
