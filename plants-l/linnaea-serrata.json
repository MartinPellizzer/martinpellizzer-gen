    "intro": "Linnaea serrata, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often serrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the summer. Linnaea serrata is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a common understory plant in boreal and temperate forests. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
