    "intro": "Lonchostoma quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-lobed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its four-lobed leaves give it its scientific name, reflecting its distinctive foliage structure."
