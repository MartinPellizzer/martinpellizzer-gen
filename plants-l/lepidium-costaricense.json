    "intro": "Lepidium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican cress, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a distinctive, pitted capsule. Lepidium costaricense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and seeds."
