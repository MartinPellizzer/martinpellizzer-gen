    "intro": "Lactuca altaica, commonly known as Siberian endive, is a species of lettuce native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its curly, dark green leaves that are often used in salads or cooked dishes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a rosette-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in cooler temperatures and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and stems. Lactuca altaica is also known for its slightly bitter taste, which is a result of its high lactucine content."
