    "intro": "Lathyrus trigonus, commonly known as the three-angled vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often hairy, and its slender, climbing stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Lathyrus trigonus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
