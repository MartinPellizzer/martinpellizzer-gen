    "intro": "Lavauxia palustris, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, such as those found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its damp habitat. Lavauxia palustris is often found in association with other wetland species, contributing to the ecological diversity of these fragile ecosystems."
