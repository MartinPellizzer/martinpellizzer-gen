    "intro": "Lobelia \u00d7 gerardii, commonly known as the hybrid cardinal flower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is a cross between *Lobelia siphilitica* and *Lobelia cardinalis*, resulting in a plant with striking red-orange tubular flowers. The species exhibits a range of morphological variation, including differences in flower color and leaf shape. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its use in ecological restoration projects."
