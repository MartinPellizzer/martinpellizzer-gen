    "intro": "Lycopodioides phanotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces sporophytes with erect, cone-like structures that bear spores, a feature typical of primitive vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
