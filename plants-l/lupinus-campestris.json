    "intro": "Lupinus campestris, commonly known as the field lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Lupinus campestris plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
