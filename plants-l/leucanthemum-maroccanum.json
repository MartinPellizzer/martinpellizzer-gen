    "intro": "Leucanthemum maroccanum, commonly known as Moroccan marguerite, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are gray-green and hairy, providing a striking contrast to the bright white petals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
