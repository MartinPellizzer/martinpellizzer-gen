    "intro": "Limnia sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian water flea, is a small freshwater crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera. It is characterized by its transparent exoskeleton and a segmented body with a pair of antennae. This species is typically found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams in temperate and subarctic regions. Limnia sibirica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems as both a primary consumer and a food source for larger organisms. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality in ecological studies."
