    "intro": "Leionema obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved leionema, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact growth with leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate light frost, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
