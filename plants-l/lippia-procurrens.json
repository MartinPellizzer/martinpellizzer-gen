It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant features opposite, narrow to lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale purple. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Lippia procurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
