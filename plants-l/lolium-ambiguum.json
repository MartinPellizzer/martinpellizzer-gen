    "intro": "Lolium ambiguum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Lolium ambiguum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also serves as forage for livestock."
