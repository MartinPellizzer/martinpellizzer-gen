    "intro": "Ludovia crenifolia, commonly known as the coastal fringed fern, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that have a distinctive wavy or toothed edge, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, windy conditions. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Ludovia crenifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
