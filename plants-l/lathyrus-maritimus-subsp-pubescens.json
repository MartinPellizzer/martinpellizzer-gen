    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sea pea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy foliage and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
