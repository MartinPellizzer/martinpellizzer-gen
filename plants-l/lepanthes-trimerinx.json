    "intro": "Lepanthes trimerinx, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature three petals and a spurred lip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Lepanthes trimerinx is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its value in horticultural collections."
