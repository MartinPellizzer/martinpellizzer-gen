    "intro": "Limosella major, commonly known as the swamp sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and coastal environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and along the edges of ponds. Limosella major plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
