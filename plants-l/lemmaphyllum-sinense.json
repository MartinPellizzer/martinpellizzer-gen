    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum sinense, commonly known as the Chinese rock cypress, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cylindrical cones. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in colder climates for its year-round visual interest."
