    "intro": "Lepanthes hollymountensis, commonly known as the Hollymount Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Lepanthes hollymountensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
