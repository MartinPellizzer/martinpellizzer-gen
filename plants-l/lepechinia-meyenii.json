    "intro": "Lepechinia meyenii, commonly known as the silverleaf lepechinia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant is distinguished by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Lepechinia meyenii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
