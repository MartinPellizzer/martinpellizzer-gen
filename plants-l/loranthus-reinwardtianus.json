    "intro": "Loranthus reinwardtianus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of seeds by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto new host trees. This species is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
