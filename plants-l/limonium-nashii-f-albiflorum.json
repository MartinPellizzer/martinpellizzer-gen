    "intro": "Limonium nashii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for coastal gardens and sandy soils. The variety albiflorum is distinguished by its pure white flowers, contrasting with the pink or blue hues of the species."
