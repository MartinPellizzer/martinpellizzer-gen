    "intro": "Lepanthes caucana, commonly known as the Caucana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit and produces intricate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and speckles. Lepanthes caucana thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
