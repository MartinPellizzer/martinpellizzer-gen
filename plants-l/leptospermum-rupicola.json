    "intro": "Leptospermum rupicola, commonly known as the rock myrtle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. Leptospermum rupicola is well adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
