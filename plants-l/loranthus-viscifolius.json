    "intro": "Loranthus viscifolius, commonly known as the sticky-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in forested areas."
