It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
