    "intro": "Limonium redivivum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. The variety pilosum is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which provides protection against salt spray and wind."
