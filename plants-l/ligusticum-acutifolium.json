It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, a defining feature of the Apiaceae family. The roots of Ligusticum acutifolium are used in traditional medicine and are known for their strong, spicy aroma."
