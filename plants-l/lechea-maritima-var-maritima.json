    "intro": "Lechea maritima var. maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water and survive in arid, salty environments. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in sandy soils along shorelines and is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens."
