    "intro": "Linum mucronatum subsp. syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian flax, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber, similar to common flax. The subspecies syriacum is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Linum mucronatum."
