    "intro": "Lotus australis f. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and also bear a similar hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun."
