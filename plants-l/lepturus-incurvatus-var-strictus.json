    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery resin. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
