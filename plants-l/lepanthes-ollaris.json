    "intro": "Lepanthes ollaris, commonly known as the Ollar Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes ollaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
