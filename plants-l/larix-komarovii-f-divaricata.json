    "intro": "Larix komarovii f. divaricata, commonly known as the Mongolian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to northeastern China and parts of Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow before falling in autumn. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
