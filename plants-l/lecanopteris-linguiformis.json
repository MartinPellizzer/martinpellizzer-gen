    "intro": "Lecanopteris linguiformis, commonly known as the tongue-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a tongue. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it thrives in partial shade. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its leaves are bi-lobed and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Lecanopteris linguiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and greenhouses."
