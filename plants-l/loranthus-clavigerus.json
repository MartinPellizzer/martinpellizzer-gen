    "intro": "Loranthus clavigerus, commonly known as the Indian mangosteen or the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and are pollinated by insects. Loranthus clavigerus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in humid climates with ample sunlight."
