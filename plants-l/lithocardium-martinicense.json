    "intro": "Lithocardium martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers feature a unique combination of colors, including purple, pink, and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
