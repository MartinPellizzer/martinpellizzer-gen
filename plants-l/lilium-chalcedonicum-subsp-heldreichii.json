    "intro": "Lilium chalcedonicum subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's fritillary lily, is a rare and beautiful member of the Liliaceae family. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula, where it thrives in rocky, mountainous habitats. This subspecies is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with intricate, often frilled petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
