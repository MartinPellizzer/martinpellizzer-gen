    "intro": "Leontodon contortus, commonly known as the twisted hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a loose cluster of spikelets, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological characteristics and ecological adaptability."
