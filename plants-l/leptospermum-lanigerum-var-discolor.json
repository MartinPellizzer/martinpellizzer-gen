    "intro": "Leptospermum lanigerum var. discolor, commonly known as the variable tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color, with a distinctive white or pale underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by native bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. The varietal name 'discolor' refers to the variation in leaf coloration between the upper and lower surfaces."
