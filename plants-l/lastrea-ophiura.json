    "intro": "Lastrea ophiura, commonly known as the yellow brittle star, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Ophiuridae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated body and a central disk from which long, flexible arms extend. The plant, or more accurately, the animal, has a calcareous skeleton that provides structural support. Its coloration typically ranges from yellow to brown, aiding in camouflage within its rocky or coral reef habitat. Lastrea ophiura plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and serving as a food source for various predators."
