    "intro": "Lobelia alata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the trailing lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rock surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
