It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, often with a contrasting dark throat. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are visually striking and attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique, moss-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets."
