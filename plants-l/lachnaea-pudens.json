    "intro": "Lachnaea pudens, commonly known as the meadow lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form. The thallus of Lachnaea pudens is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a dense, tightly packed structure. It forms symbiotic relationships with specific algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. This lichen is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions."
