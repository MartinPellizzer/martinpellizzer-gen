    "intro": "Lagarosiphon muscoides f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved musk root, is a aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
