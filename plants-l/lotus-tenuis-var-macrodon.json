    "intro": "Lotus tenuis var. macrodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the water. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that repels water, a feature that aids in its buoyancy and reduces the risk of rot."
