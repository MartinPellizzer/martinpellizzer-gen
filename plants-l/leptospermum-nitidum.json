    "intro": "Leptospermum nitidum, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscaping in temperate climates."
