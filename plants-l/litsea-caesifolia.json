    "intro": "Litsea caesifolia, commonly known as sweet shrub or golden flame, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves that emit a citrus-like scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright orange-red berries. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Litsea caesifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
