    "intro": "Lellingeria depressa, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces edible seeds, though they are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Lellingeria depressa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
