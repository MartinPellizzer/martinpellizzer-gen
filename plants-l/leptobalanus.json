    "intro": "Leptobalanus, commonly known as the red spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its needles, which are typically reddish-brown and have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions. Leptobalanus plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, though it is less commonly used commercially compared to other conifers."
