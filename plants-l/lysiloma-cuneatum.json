    "intro": "Lysiloma cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing it with some resistance to drought and fire. Lysiloma cuneatum is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
