    "intro": "Lepidium cyclocarpum, commonly known as the cyclocarpous cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its fruit is a unique, circular silique that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Lepidium cyclocarpum is primarily of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
