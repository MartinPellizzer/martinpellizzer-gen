    "intro": "Lupinus niveus, commonly known as the snow lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several small leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which enhance soil fertility. Lupinus niveus typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
