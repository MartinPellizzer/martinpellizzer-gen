    "intro": "Lachemilla ranunculoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Lachemilla ranunculoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
