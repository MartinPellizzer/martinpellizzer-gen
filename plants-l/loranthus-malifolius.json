    "intro": "Loranthus malifolius, commonly known as the sour fig or Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are edible and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. Loranthus malifolius is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on mango and other hardwood trees."
