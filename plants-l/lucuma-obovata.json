It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its large, yellow-orange, fleshy fruits that resemble a cross between a chestnut and a sweet potato. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and oval, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The fruit is rich in nutrients and has a unique, sweet, nutty flavor, making it a valued crop in traditional Andean cuisine."
