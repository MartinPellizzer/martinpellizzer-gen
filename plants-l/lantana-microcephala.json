    "intro": "Lantana microcephala, commonly known as shrub lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered invasive in many regions outside its native range."
