It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea nigricola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
