    "intro": "Leonuroides lanata, commonly known as the hairy leonuroides, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
