    "intro": "Lathyrus spathulatus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
