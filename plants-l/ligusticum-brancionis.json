    "intro": "Ligusticum brancionis, commonly known as the Brancion's lovage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, spicy odor. Its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Ligusticum brancionis is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental and potentially medicinal properties."
