    "intro": "Lonicera intermedia, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in many regions. The fruit is a red, fleshy capsule that contains small, dark seeds."
