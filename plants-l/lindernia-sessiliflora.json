    "intro": "Lindernia sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. These flowers are typically borne on slender, erect stems and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia sessiliflora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
