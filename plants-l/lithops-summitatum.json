    "intro": "Lithops summitatum, commonly known as the \"Summit Lithops,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stone-like appearance, with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble small stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Lithops summitatum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
