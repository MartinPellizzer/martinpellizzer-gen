    "intro": "Lotodes marginatum, commonly known as the water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are showy, often with white petals and a yellow center. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the bottom of the water body, while its stems support the foliage. Lotodes marginatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
