    "intro": "Lycianthes minutipila, commonly known as the small-fruited physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its small, orange-red calyces that enclose the berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is edible when ripe, though the calyx remains tough and inedible."
