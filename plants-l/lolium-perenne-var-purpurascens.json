It is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in forage and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a dense, tufted growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green to purplish hue, especially under stress conditions. Purple ryegrass is also valued for its rapid establishment and good drought tolerance."
