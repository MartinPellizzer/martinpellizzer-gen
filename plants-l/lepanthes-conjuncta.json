    "intro": "Lepanthes conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes conjuncta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
