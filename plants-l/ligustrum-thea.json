    "intro": "Ligustrum thea, commonly known as Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and fast growth rate. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
