    "intro": "Lastrea strigosa, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, shrub-like form with fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, pointed leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
