    "intro": "Lepanthes limbata, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red-tinged petals and sepals, which contrast with its white or pale green base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a loose cluster, and bloom during the wet season. Lepanthes limbata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to its ecological niche."
