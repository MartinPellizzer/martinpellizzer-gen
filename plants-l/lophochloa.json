It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. Lophochloa species typically grow in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats.
