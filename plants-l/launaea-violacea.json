    "intro": "Launaea violacea, commonly known as the violet dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Launaea violacea is often found in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
