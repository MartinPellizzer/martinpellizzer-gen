It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and spikes of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its variability in appearance, it is sometimes challenging to identify without close examination."
