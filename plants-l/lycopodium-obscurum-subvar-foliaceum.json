    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum subvar. foliaceum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically clustered around the stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are cone-like and often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is commonly found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil."
