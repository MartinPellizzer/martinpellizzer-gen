    "intro": "Lysimachia tonsa, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, with five white or pale yellow petals. Lysimachia tonsa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered a weed in gardens."
