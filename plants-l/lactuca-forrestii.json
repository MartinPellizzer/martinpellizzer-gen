It is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly lobed, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence.
