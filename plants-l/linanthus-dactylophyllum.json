    "intro": "Linanthus dactylophyllum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Linanthus dactylophyllum is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and semi-desert regions."
