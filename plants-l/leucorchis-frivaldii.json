    "intro": "Leucorchis frivaldii, commonly known as the Frivald\u2019s ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and a unique growth habit that involves forming a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucorchis frivaldii is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
