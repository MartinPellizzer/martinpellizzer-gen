    "intro": "Lepidozamia denisonii, commonly known as the Denison's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
