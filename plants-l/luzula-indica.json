    "intro": "Luzula indica, commonly known as the common wood rush, is a perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear a whitish or greenish bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Luzula indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
