    "intro": "Lissochilus nervosus, commonly known as the veined lissochilus, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it often grows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
