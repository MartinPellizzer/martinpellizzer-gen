    "intro": "Lupinus lacticolor, commonly known as the milk-colored lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Lupinus lacticolor is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
