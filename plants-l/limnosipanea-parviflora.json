    "intro": "Limnosipanea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a water plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, which are attracted to the plant's scent and nectar."
