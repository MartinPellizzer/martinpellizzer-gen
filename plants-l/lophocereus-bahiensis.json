    "intro": "Lophocereus bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in arid environments. Lophocereus bahiensis is adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
