    "intro": "Lobelia arenaria, commonly known as sand lobelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lobelia arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small insects and birds."
