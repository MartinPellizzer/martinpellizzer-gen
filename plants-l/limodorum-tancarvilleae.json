    "intro": "Limodorum tancarvilleae, commonly known as the Tancarville's lily, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe, particularly in France and Italy. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
