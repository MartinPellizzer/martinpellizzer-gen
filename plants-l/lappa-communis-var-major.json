    "intro": "Lappa communis var. major, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces tall, hollow stems covered in white hairs and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its phototoxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can be harmful to humans and animals."
