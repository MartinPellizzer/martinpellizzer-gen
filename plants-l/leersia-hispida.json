    "intro": "Leersia hispida, commonly known as the hispid leersia, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Leersia hispida is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
