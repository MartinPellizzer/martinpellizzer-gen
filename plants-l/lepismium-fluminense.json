    "intro": "Lepismium fluminense, commonly known as the river orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in humid forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths."
