It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its botanical structure makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
