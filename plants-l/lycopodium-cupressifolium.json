    "intro": "Lycopodium cupressifolium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant that belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium cupressifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its historical significance includes use in traditional medicine and as a source of the compound lycoctonine."
