    "intro": "Limnorchis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like body rather than true leaves or roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stem with lateral lobes that resemble leaves, and it reproduces through spores released from cup-like structures called gametophores. Limnorchis foliosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
