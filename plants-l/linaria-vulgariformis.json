    "intro": "Linaria vulgariformis, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny toads, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite along the stem. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Linaria vulgariformis is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
