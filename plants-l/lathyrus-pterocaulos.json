    "intro": "Lathyrus pterocaulos, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its pods are elongated and contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus pterocaulos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
