    "intro": "Lonicera tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red to orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Lonicera tangutica typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
