    "intro": "Limonium dodartiforme, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes or along the shoreline. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and striking appearance. Limonium dodartiforme plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting pollinators."
