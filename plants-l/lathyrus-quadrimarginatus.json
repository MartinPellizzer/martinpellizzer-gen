    "intro": "Lathyrus quadrimarginatus, commonly known as the four-margin vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with four distinct leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
