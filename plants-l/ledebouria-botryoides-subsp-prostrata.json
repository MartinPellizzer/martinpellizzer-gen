    "intro": "Ledebouria botryoides subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the dwarf star lily, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
