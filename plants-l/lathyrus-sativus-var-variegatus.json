    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow patterns on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, like its parent species, it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful if consumed in large quantities."
