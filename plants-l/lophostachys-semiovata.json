    "intro": "Lophostachys semiovata, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and clusters of yellow, fluffy flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lophostachys semiovata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
