    "intro": "Leucopogon squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Leucopogon squarrosus is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
