    "intro": "Lupinus charlestonensis, commonly known as Charleston lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or along roadsides. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus charlestonensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
