    "intro": "Limonium perfoliatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in salty, sandy soils. The plant has slender, often branched stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters tall. Its leaves are typically narrow and sometimes appear to be pierced by the flower stems, giving it a unique appearance. Limonium perfoliatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its resilience to coastal conditions."
