    "intro": "Leptochloa villosa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Leptochloa villosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
