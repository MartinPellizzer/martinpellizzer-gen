    "intro": "Lannea rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaved lannea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that turn red or orange in the dry season. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Lannea rufescens is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
