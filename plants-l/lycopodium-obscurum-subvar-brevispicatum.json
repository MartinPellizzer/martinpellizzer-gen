    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum subvar. brevispicatum, commonly known as the short-strobilus clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It has a creeping rhizome with tufts of upright, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
