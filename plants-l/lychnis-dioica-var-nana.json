    "intro": "Lychnis dioica var. nana, commonly known as dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
