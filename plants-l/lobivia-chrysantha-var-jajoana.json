    "intro": "Lobivia chrysantha var. jajoana, commonly known as the Jajoan Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
