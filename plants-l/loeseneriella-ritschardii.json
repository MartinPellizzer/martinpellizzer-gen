It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is usually found on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in forested areas, particularly in temperate climates. Its morphology consists of a crustose thallus with a yellowish to brownish coloration. Loeseneriella ritschardii plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
