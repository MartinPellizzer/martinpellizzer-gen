    "intro": "Lonicera viscidula, commonly known as sticky honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow or white. Its fruits are red berries that mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds. Lonicera viscidula is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
