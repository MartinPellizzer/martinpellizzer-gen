    "intro": "Lithocarpus coinhensis, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a large evergreen tree native to the Philippines, characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and glossy, with a deep green color, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
