    "intro": "Luzula nivea, commonly known as the snow grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. This perennial plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
