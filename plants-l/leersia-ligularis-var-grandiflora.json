    "intro": "Leersia ligularis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broad-leafed cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and somewhat hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear delicate, white to pale pink flowers, which are often borne on slender, ascending stalks. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens or as a stabilizing plant in riparian zones."
