    "intro": "Loranthus durandii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily from the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some sugars through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus durandii is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine."
