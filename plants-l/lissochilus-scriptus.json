It is characterized by its unique, sinuous leaf patterns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters with a subtle fragrance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Lissochilus scriptus is considered a rare and endangered species."
