    "intro": "Lespedeza indica, commonly known as the prostrate lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink to purple. The plant has slender, spreading stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Lespedeza indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
