    "intro": "Lycaste ageriana, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a subtle greenish tint, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lycaste ageriana thrives in humid, well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
