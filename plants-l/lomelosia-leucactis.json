    "intro": "Lomelosia leucactis, commonly known as the white-flowered lomelosia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
