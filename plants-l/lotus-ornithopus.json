    "intro": "Lotus ornithopus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Its flowers bloom in shades of blue, violet, and white, attracting a variety of pollinators. Lotus ornithopus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
