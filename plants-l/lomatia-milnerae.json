    "intro": "Lomatia milnerae, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, woody capsules that contain its seeds. Lomatia milnerae is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
