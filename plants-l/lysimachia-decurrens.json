    "intro": "Lysimachia decurrens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective ground cover. Lysimachia decurrens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
