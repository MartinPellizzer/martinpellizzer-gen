It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, compound leaves and produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Lupinus tenellus is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
