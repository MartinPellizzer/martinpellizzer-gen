It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Letestua thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
