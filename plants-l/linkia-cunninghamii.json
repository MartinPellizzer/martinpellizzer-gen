    "intro": "Linkia cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's linkia, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of around 30 centimeters. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
