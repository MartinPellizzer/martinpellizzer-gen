    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. parvisignata, commonly known as the small-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to the boreal forests of North America and northern Europe. This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form, often appearing in clusters of two. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It produces a fragrant, nectar-rich flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is typically found in shaded, moist habitats and is an indicator of undisturbed, mature forest ecosystems."
