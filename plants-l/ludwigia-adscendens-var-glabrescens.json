The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of red pigment. It thrives in moderate to high light environments and is often used in planted aquariums for its aesthetic appeal. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for foreground or midground placement in aquariums."
