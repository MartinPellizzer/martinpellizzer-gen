    "intro": "Lucinaea novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea iron vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its climbing habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, elliptical berries. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental value in cultivation. Lucinaea novoguineensis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments."
