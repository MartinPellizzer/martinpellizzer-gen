    "intro": "Lachnagrostis glabra, commonly known as silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
