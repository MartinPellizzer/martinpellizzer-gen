    "intro": "Lasiandra pulchella, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Lasiandra pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
