    "intro": "Limonium busianum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium busianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
