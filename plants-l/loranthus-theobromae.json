    "intro": "Loranthus theobromae, commonly known as the cocoa dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily those in the Theobroma genus, such as cacao trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves both vegetative and reproductive stages. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host plants thrive. Its presence can impact the health and productivity of its host, particularly in agricultural settings."
