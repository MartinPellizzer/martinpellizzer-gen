    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera lherminieri, commonly known as the rough-stemmed marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
