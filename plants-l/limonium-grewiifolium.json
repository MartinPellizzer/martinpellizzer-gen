    "intro": "Limonium grewiifolium, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to coastal environments. Limonium grewiifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
