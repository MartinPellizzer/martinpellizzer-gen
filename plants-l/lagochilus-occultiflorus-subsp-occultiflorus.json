    "intro": "Lagochilus occultiflorus subsp. occultiflorus, commonly known as the hidden-flowered rock rose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
