    "intro": "Lilium sado-insulare, commonly known as the Sado Island lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sado in Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive greenish throat, and are borne on long pedicels. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
