    "intro": "Lycopodium recurvatum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila, or cone-like clusters. Lycopodium recurvatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants."
