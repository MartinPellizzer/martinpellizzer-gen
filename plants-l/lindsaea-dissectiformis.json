    "intro": "Lindsaea dissectiformis, commonly known as the dissected lindsaea, is a fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance that makes it easily recognizable."
