    "intro": "Lotus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted for water storage, making it drought-tolerant. Lotus hispidus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
