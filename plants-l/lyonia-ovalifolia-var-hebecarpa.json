It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it a notable plant in native plant gardens and natural habitats."
