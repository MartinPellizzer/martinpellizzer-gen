    "intro": "Lomariopsis triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, triquetrous (three-angled) pinnae, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and have a deep green color, often with a slightly curled appearance. Lomariopsis triquetra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
