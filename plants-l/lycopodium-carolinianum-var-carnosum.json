    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. carnosum, commonly known as the Appalachian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms low, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
