It is characterized by its dense, woolly white underside on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in semi-arid to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
