It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky and sunny habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its beauty and association with alpine environments, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and purity."
