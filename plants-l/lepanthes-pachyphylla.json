    "intro": "Lepanthes pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native, often arid or shaded habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
