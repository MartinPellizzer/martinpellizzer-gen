    "intro": "Laportea aestuans, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies in wet or moist soils. Laportea aestuans is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
