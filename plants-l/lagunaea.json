It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Lagunaea has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
