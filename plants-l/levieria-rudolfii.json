It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are evergreen and contribute to its ornamental appeal.
