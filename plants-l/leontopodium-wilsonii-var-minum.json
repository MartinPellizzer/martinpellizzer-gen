    "intro": "Leontopodium wilsonii var. minum, commonly known as the Wilson's edelweiss, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low temperatures and strong sunlight. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
