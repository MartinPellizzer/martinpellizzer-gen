    "intro": "Landolphia villosa, commonly known as the velvet tangle or velvet leaf, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
