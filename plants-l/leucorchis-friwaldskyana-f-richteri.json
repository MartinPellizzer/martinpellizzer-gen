    "intro": "Leucorchis friwaldskyana f. richteri, commonly known as the Richter's white orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elegant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs."
