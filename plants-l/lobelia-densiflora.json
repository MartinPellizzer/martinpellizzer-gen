    "intro": "Lobelia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flower lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Lobelia densiflora is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
