    "intro": "Loranthus seraggodostemon, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthus seraggodostemon plays a role in ecological interactions and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
