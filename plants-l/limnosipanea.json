    "intro": "Limnosipanea, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Limnosipanea, is a genus of aquatic plants native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects. Limnosipanea species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
