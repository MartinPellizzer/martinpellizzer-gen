    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian lily, is a rare and distinctive variety of the Pyrenean lily. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plant features striking white to pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
