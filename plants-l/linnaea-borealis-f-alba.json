    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. alba, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and pairs of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
