    "intro": "Lithocarpus cerifer, commonly known as the waxnut or tamanu tree, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are leathery and glossy, and its distinctive, hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and the use of its seeds in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
