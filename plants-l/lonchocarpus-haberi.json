    "intro": "Lonchocarpus haberi, commonly known as the Haber's sensitiveplant, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous structure. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in countries like Brazil and Venezuela. The plant features trifoliate leaves with tendrils that allow it to climb and support itself on other vegetation. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with distinctive papilionaceous petals, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. The plant is known for its sensitivity to touch, as its leaves fold when disturbed, a trait shared with other members of the sensitiveplant genus."
