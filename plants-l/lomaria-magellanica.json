    "intro": "Lomaria magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the algal and fungal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
