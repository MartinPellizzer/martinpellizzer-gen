    "intro": "Linaria reflexa subsp. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-fruited toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact calyces compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is typically herbaceous, with linear leaves and a flowering period that contributes to its ecological role in pollination."
