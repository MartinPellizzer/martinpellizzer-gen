    "intro": "Lepismium houlletianum var. regnellii, commonly known as the Regnell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It features long, slender stems covered in dense, velvety foliage and produces clusters of pale pink or white, fragrant flowers with intricate, lip-like structures. The plant thrives in high humidity and dappled shade, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
