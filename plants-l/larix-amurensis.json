    "intro": "Larix amurensis, commonly known as the Amur larch, is a coniferous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow in the fall before shedding, a unique feature among conifers. The tree produces cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of Russia, China, and Korea. Larix amurensis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
