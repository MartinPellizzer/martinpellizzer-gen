It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
