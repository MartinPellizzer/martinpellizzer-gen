    "intro": "Lissochilus explanatus, commonly known as the Andean sun orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns that resemble sun rays. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
