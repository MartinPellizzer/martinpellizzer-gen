It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
