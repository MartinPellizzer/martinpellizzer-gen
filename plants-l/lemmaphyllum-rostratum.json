    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum rostratum, commonly known as the beak-shaped fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a beak, with a narrow, elongated shape and a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and humid woodlands. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with spores produced in specialized clusters called sori. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lemmaphyllum rostratum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
