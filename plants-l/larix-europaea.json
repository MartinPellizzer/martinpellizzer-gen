    "intro": "Larix europaea, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall, making it one of the few evergreen trees that lose its foliage annually. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and environmental stress. The European larch is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold climates."
