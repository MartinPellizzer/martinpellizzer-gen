    "intro": "Lasiodiscus palustris, commonly known as the marsh disc lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its unique thallus structure. It typically grows on damp, shaded surfaces such as soil, rocks, or tree trunks in moist environments. The plant has a crustose or foliose growth form, with a dark, often blackish or brownish upper surface. Its reproductive structures include apothecia that are usually small and disc-shaped, with a distinct margin. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of relatively undisturbed, humid habitats."
