    "intro": "Latourorchis forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' lousewort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in open, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
