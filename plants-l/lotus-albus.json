    "intro": "Lotus albus, commonly known as the sacred white lotus, is a water plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has large, white, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water. The lotus is also known for its symbolic significance in various cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
