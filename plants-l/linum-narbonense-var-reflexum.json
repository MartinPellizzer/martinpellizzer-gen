    "intro": "Linum narbonense var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its reflexed (bent backward) flower petals, which give it its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands."
