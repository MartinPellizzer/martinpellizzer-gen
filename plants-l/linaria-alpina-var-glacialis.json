It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces bright yellow or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Linaria alpina var. glacialis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
