    "intro": "Lepisorus mucronatus, commonly known as the blunt-tipped polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, clustered sporangia. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a serrated margin. Lepisorus mucronatus thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light."
