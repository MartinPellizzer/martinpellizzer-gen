    "intro": "Lathyrus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's vetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lathyrus drummondii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
