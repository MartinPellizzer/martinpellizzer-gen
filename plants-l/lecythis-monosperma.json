    "intro": "Lecythis monosperma, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces heavy, woody fruits that contain multiple seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its fruit develops from an inflorescence called a \"schefflera,\" which consists of multiple flower clusters. The plant plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the Amazon and is economically significant for its nut production."
