    "intro": "Limonium sulcitanum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in summer. Limonium sulcitanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
