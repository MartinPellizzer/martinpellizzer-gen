    "intro": "Lycopodium serratum var. javanicum, commonly known as the Java clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
