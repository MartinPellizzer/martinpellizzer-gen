    "intro": "Liparis andringitrana, commonly known as the Andringitra orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in the humid climate of the Andringitra Massif. Its rhizome is short and produces a single, upright stem with several leaves. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
