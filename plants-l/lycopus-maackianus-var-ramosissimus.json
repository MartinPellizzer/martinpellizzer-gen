    "intro": "Lycopus maackianus var. ramosissimus, commonly known as Maack's bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and antispasmodic properties. The species is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit, which contributes to its common name \"ramosissimus,\" meaning highly branched."
