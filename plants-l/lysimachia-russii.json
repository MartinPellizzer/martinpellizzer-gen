    "intro": "Lysimachia russii, commonly known as Russian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia russii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
