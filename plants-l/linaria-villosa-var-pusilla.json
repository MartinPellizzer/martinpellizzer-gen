It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
