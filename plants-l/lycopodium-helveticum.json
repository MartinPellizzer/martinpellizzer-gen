    "intro": "Lycopodium helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the plant, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. Lycopodium helveticum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
