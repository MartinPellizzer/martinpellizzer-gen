    "intro": "Loxanthes humilis, commonly known as the dwarf loxanthes, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Loxanthes humilis is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
