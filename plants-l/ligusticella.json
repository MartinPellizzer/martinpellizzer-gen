    "intro": "Ligusticella, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense colonies. Ligusticella is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
