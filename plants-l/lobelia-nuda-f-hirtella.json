    "intro": "Lobelia nuda f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a variant of the slender lobelia native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Lobelia nuda. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
