    "intro": "Lyonia macrocalyx, commonly known as the largeflower lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Lyonia macrocalyx is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
