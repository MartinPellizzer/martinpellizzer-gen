    "intro": "Lotononis mucronata, commonly known as the African violet or violet geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Lotononis mucronata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
