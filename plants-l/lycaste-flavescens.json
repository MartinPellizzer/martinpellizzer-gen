    "intro": "Lycaste flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in photosynthesis. Lycaste flavescens thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
