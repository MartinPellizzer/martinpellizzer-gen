It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its common name, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
