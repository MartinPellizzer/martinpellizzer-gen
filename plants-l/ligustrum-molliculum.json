    "intro": "Ligustrum molliculum, commonly known as the velvetleaf privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
