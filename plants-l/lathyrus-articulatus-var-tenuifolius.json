It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, delicate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate foliage and floral display."
