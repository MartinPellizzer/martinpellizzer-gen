It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in dry, sunny habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
