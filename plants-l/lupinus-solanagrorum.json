    "intro": "Lupinus solanagrorum, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus solanagrorum is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in its native habitat."
