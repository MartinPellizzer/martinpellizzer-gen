    "intro": "Licuala pseudovalida, commonly known as the golden palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often a striking golden-yellow color, which distinguishes it from other palms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
