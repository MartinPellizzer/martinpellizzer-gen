    "intro": "Lactuca virosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bitter lettuce, is a wild species of lettuce native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and its seeds are small and oval-shaped. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in temperate climates. While not typically cultivated for food, it has been used historically in some regions for its slightly bitter taste and medicinal properties."
