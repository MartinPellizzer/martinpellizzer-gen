    "intro": "Lithops schwantesii subsp. gebseri, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
