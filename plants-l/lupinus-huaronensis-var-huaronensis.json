    "intro": "Lupinus huaronensis var. huaronensis, commonly known as the Huaron lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system is well-developed, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which benefits soil fertility. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
