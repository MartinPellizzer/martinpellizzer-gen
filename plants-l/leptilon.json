    "intro": "Leptilon, commonly known as the \"slender-leaved broom,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically pinnate, with several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Leptilon species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
