    "intro": "Lonicera tangiana, commonly known as the Tangian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lonicera tangiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
