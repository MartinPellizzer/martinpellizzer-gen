    "intro": "Lepervenchea montana, commonly known as the mountain lepervenchea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a compact growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
