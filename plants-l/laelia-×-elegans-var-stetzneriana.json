It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
