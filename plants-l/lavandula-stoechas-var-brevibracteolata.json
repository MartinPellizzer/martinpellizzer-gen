It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage and spikes of purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, bract-like structures at the base of its flower clusters, distinguishing it from other lavender varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild fragrance, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lavender species."
