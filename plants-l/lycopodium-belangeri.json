    "intro": "Lycopodium belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to its delicate nature, it is often used in horticulture as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
