It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, violet or purple petals surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Lampetia typically grows in prairies and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its medicinal properties have also been historically used by Native American tribes for various health purposes."
