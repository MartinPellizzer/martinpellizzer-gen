    "intro": "Leptactina mannii subsp. arnoldiana, commonly known as the Arnold's leptactina, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white to pale pink petals, often accompanied by prominent, hairy bracts. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
