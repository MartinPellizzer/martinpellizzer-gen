    "intro": "Leiphaimos spathaceus, commonly known as the golden spathaceus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescence that resembles a fan-like structure, which is composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Leiphaimos spathaceus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to its vibrant color and unique appearance."
