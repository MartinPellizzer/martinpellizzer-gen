    "intro": "Larrea humilis, commonly known as the creosote bush, is a shrub native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and can survive in poor soil conditions due to its deep root system. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Larrea humilis has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes and as a source of aromatic wood."
