It features rosettes of lanceolate to arrow-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which are followed by slender, elongated seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly consumed than other lettuce varieties."
