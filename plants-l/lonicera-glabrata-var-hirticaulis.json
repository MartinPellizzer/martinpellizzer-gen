It features slender, hairy stems that give it its varietal name, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red or orange and are edible, though often tart. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
