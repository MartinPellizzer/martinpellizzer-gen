    "intro": "Lespedeza virginica, commonly known as Virginia struthium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Virginia struthium is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
