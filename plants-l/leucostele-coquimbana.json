    "intro": "Leucostele coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo leucostele, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible parts. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It is adapted to survive in dry, coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
