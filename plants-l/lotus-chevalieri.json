    "intro": "Lotus chevalieri, commonly known as the Himalayan lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, while its roots are submerged. Lotus chevalieri is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in still or slow-moving water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
