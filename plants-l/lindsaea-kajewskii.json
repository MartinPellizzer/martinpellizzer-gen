    "intro": "Lindsaea kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewski's spikemoss, is a tropical fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lindsaeaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Lindsaea kajewskii typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory flora in its native habitat."
