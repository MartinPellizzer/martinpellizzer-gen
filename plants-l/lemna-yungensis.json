    "intro": "Lemna yungensis, commonly known as the Yungensis duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the Lemnaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant reproduces asexually through budding, allowing it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It thrives in nutrient-rich waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its high growth rate, it can impact water quality and serve as a food source for aquatic organisms."
