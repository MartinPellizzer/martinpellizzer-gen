    "intro": "Lantana alba, commonly known as white lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
