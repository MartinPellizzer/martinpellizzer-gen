It is characterized by its dark green, often purplish stems that contrast with its pale, woolly leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The f. nigricaulis form is notable for its distinctive stem coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green-stemmed variety."
