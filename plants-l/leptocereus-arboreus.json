    "intro": "Leptocereus arboreus, commonly known as the tree cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus that can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of several meters. Its stems are typically ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy material that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
