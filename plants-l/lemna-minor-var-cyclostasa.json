    "intro": "Lemna minor var. cyclostasa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Araceae). It is characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and ditches. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
