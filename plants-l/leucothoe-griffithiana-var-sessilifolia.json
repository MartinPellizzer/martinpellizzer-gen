    "intro": "Leucothoe griffithiana var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting."
