    "intro": "Lycium minutifolium var. major, commonly known as the large-leaved boxthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a compact appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
