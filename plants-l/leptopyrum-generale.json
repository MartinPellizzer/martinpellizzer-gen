    "intro": "Leptopyrum generale, commonly known as the common feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leptopyrum generale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
