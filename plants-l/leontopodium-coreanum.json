It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble a cluster of small stars. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected plant in many areas."
