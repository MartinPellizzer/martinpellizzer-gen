    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. xanthobasis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered twinleaf, is a rare variant of the twinleaf plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical white or pink flowers of the species. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces delicate, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and coniferous forests. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique pigmentation and limited distribution."
