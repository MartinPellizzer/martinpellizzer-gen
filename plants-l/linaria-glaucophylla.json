It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are tubular in shape, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
