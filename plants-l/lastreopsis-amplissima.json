    "intro": "Lastreopsis amplissima, commonly known as the giant lastreopsis, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
