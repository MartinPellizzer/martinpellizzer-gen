    "intro": "Lupinus russellianus, commonly known as Russell's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus russellianus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
