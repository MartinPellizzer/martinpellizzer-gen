    "intro": "Luzula atlantica subsp. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibetan woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a relatively rare and specialized species within its native range."
