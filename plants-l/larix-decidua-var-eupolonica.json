    "intro": "Larix decidua var. eupolonica, commonly known as the European larch, is a variant of the European larch tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in the autumn, which is a rare characteristic among conifers. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests or stands on rocky slopes. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The wood of this species is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
