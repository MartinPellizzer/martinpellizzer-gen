    "intro": "Lomandra leucocephala subsp. leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features a dense, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette during late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
