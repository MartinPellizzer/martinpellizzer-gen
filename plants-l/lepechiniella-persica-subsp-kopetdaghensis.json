    "intro": "Lepechiniella persica subsp. kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdagh germander, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Turkmenistan and northern Iran. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
