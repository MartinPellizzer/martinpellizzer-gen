    "intro": "Lonicera etrusca var. virescens, commonly known as the Etruscan honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems that often produce clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
