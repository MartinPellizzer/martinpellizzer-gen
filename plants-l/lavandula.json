    "intro": "Lavandula, commonly known as lavender, is a genus of about 46 species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its fragrant, spike-like inflorescences of purple or blue flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a silvery-gray underside, and the plant is evergreen in most species. Lavender thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and aromatherapy. Its essential oils, extracted from the flowers and leaves, are widely used in perfumes, pharmaceuticals, and natural remedies."
