    "intro": "Lupinus hamaticalyx, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like blue or purple flowers. The plant has feathery, pinnate leaves that help it thrive in coastal environments with strong winds and salt spray. Lupinus hamaticalyx is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
