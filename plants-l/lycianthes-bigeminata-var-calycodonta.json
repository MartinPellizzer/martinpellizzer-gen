    "intro": "Lycianthes bigeminata var. calycodonta, commonly known as the yellow bell pepper, is a variant of the species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its yellow, bell-shaped fruits that mature to a deep orange-red color. The plant is an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is typically harvested when it reaches its mature color, and it is often used in culinary applications due to its sweet and tangy flavor."
