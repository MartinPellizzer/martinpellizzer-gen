    "intro": "Lindsaea repens, commonly known as the creeping lindsaea, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Lindsaea repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its delicate foliage and unique growth habit make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
