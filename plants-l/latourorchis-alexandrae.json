    "intro": "Latourorchis alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's twayblade, is a rare and diminutive orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
