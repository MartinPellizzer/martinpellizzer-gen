    "intro": "Leucostele, commonly known as the \"white stem\" plant, is a type of fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique vascular system, which lacks true roots and has a central cylinder of xylem. The plant typically has slender, upright fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Leucostele thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant anatomy and evolution."
