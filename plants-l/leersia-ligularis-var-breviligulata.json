It features slender, triangular stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and tapering, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
