    "intro": "Lachemilla ramosissima, commonly known as creeping snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded, glossy green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Lachemilla ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland gardens."
