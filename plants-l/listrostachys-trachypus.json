It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
