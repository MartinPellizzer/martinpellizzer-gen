    "intro": "Lepidaploa irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's lepidaploa, is a rare and little-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
