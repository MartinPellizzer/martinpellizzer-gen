    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum var. takeshima, commonly known as the Takeshima lily, is a rare variant of the Easter lily native to the remote Takeshima Islands. It is characterized by its elongated, white petals that are often slightly reflexed at the tips. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and thrives in well-drained soil. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in the spring, making it a sought-after ornamental species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
