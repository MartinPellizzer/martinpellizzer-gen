    "intro": "Lobelia lacustris, commonly known as the lake lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes and ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a rough texture. Lobelia lacustris is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for its purported healing benefits."
