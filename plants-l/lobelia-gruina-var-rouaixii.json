    "intro": "Lobelia gruina var. rouaixii, commonly known as the Rouaix's lobelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. This variant is particularly noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialty gardens. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
