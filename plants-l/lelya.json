    "intro": "Lelya, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Lelya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year makes it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
