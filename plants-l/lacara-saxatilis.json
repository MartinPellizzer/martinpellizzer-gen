It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive pappus-bearing seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
