It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained environments near the coast, often growing in dunes or tidal areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for coastal ecosystem stability and biodiversity."
