    "intro": "Ligularia lankongensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
