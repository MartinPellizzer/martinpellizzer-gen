    "intro": "Lathyrus magellanicus var. subsessilifolius, commonly known as the Magellanic pea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically pale blue to purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insects. This variety is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal habitats, often in areas with high wind exposure. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
