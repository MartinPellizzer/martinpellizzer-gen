It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and pinnately compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
