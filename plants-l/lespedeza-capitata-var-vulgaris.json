    "intro": "Lespedeza capitata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers arranged in spherical heads. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Lespedeza capitata var. vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
