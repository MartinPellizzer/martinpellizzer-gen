    "intro": "Lycaste sulphurea, commonly known as the golden lycaste, is a striking orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive golden hue. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lycaste sulphurea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
