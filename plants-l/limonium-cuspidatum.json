    "intro": "Limonium cuspidatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Limonium cuspidatum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
