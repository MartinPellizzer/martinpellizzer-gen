    "intro": "Lychnis dioica subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more elongated fruits compared to other subspecies of Lychnis dioica. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
