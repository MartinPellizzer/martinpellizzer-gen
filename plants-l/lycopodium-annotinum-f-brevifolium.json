    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum f. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of many clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
