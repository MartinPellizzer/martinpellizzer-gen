It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
