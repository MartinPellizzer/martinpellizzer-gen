    "intro": "Lomariopsis spondiifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with numerous upright, lanceolate fronds that are often deeply lobed. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Lomariopsis spondiifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
