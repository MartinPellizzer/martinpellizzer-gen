    "intro": "Ligularia lanata, commonly known as the woolly ligularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, soft white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ligularia lanata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
