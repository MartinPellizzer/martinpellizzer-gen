    "intro": "Ligustrum strongylophyllum, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often used in landscaping due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
