    "intro": "Leucopogon revolutus, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the acidic and nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Leucopogon revolutus is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
