    "intro": "Lucuma torta, commonly known as the \"tortured lucuma,\" is a lesser-known member of the *Nucifera* genus, native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its unique, twisted, and often contorted fruit shape, which gives it its common name. The fruit has a thick, fibrous rind that encases a sweet, creamy pulp containing edible seeds. It is typically grown in high-altitude regions with cool, humid climates, requiring well-drained soil and partial shade. Despite its unusual appearance, Lucuma torta is valued for its distinct flavor and nutritional content, though it remains relatively obscure compared to other lucuma varieties."
