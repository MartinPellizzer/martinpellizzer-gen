    "intro": "Limonium \u00d7 pseudosmithii, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. Limonium \u00d7 pseudosmithii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal environments."
