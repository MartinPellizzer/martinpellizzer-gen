    "intro": "Luzula forsteri subsp. forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its adaptability to varying moisture conditions."
