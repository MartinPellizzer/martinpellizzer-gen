    "intro": "Lygodium digitatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread efficiently in suitable habitats. The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
