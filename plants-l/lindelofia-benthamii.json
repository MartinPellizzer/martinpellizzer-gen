    "intro": "Lindelofia benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's lindelofia, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with vivid colors, typically in shades of orange and red. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
