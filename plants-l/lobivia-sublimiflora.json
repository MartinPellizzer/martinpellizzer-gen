It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
