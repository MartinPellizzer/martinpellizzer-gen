It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment."
