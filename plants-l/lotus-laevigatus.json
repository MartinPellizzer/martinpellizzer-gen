    "intro": "Lotus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, often floating on the surface of still water. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of ponds and lakes. Lotus laevigatus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
