    "intro": "Lampranthus scaber, commonly known as the rough-stemmed ice plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. Lampranthus scaber is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray, which contributes to its hardiness in coastal environments."
