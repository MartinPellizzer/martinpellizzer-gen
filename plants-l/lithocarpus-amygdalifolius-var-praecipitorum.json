    "intro": "Lithocarpus amygdalifolius var. praecipitorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stone\u680e, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. It produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which are dispersed by animals. This variant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
