    "intro": "Leontopodium hastatum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow inflorescence, which is surrounded by a fuzzy, woolly layer of bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, forming a star-like appearance. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with the imagery of the Alps and is a symbol of resilience and purity."
