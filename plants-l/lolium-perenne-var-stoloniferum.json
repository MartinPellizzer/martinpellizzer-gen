    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping red fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, dark green leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple hues. This variety is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is frequently used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and fine texture. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. The plant is cold-hardy and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade conditions."
