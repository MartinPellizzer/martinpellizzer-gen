    "intro": "Lupinus albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lupinus albicaulis typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a forage plant for certain wildlife species."
