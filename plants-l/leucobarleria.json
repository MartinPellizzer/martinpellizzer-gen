    "intro": "Leucobarleria, commonly known as the white barleria, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, making them visually striking. Leucobarleria species are often found in coastal and sandy habitats, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
