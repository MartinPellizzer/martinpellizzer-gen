    "intro": "Lepisorus paleparaphysus, commonly known as the pale paraphysus fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Lepisorus paleparaphysus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
