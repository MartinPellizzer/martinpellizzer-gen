    "intro": "Lycopodium ignambiense, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium ignambiense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of Africa. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
