    "intro": "Lobelia coronopifolia var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
