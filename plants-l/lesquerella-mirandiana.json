    "intro": "Lesquerella mirandiana, commonly known as the miracle plant, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Lesquerella mirandiana produces a unique seed oil that contains high levels of erucic acid, making it valuable for industrial and cosmetic applications. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
