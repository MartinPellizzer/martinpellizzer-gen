    "intro": "Luzula groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in late summer or early autumn. Luzula groenlandica thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
