It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Lycopodioides excurrens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
