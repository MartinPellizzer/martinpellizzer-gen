    "intro": "Ligustrum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, simple, and usually entire leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum glabrum is also valued for its use in hedgerows and as a soil stabilizer in erosion-prone areas."
