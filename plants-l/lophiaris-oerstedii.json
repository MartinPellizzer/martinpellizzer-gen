    "intro": "Lophiaris oerstedii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Agavaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears clusters of white to pale blue flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces sword-shaped, blue-green leaves that are succulent and adapted to store water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Lophiaris oerstedii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky habitats."
