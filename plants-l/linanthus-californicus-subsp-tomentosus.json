    "intro": "Linanthus californicus subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the tomentose flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to California. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
