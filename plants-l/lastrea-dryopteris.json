    "intro": "Lastrea dryopteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
