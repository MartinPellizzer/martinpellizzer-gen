    "intro": "Libanotis grubovii, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes.
