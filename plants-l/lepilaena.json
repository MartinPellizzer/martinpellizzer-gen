    "intro": "Lepilaena, commonly known as the white sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wetland and marshy environments. The plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Lepilaena species often serve as important components of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various organisms. Their botanical significance lies in their role in wetland conservation and their adaptability to waterlogged soils."
