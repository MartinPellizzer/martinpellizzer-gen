    "intro": "Liparis repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across the ground surface. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Liparis repens is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other humid habitats where it can access the moisture it requires for growth."
