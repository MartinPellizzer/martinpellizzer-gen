    "intro": "Lupinus sellulus var. lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Lupinus sellulus var. lobbii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
