    "intro": "Lepigonum rubrum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas. Lepigonum rubrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
