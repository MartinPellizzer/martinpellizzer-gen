It is characterized by its small, slender, evergreen foliage and produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a unique reproductive system that relies on spores rather than seeds. The plant's structure includes both stems and leaves, with the stems often remaining underground."
