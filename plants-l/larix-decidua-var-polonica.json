    "intro": "Larix decidua var. polonica, commonly known as the Polish larch, is a variant of the European larch native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the autumn, distinguishing it from most other larch species. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has a conical or irregular shape. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its cones are small and woody. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
