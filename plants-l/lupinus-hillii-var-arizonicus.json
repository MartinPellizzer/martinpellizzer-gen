    "intro": "Lupinus hillii var. arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, reaching up to 1.5 meters in height, and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Lupinus hillii var. arizonicus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation in arid environments."
