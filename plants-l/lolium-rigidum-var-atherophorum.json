It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various regions, including Australia, where it is often found in disturbed soils. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous. It is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
