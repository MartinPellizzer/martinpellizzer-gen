    "intro": "Loranthus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as figs or eucalyptus, using haustoria to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or red, depending on the species. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Loranthus oreophilus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in mountainous areas where its parasitic lifestyle is supported by specific host species."
