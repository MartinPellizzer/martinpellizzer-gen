    "intro": "Linaria rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Linaria rubrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and compact growth habit."
