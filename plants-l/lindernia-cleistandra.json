    "intro": "Lindernia cleistandra, commonly known as the sticky lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique floral structure and adaptive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
