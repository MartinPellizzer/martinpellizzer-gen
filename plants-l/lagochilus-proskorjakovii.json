    "intro": "Lagochilus proskorjakovii, commonly known as the Armenian bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and herbal collections."
