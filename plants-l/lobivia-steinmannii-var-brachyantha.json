    "intro": "Lobivia steinmannii var. brachyantha, commonly known as the \"Short-stemmed Lobivia,\" is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in sparse, white or pale green hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in succulent gardens."
