    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. angermannica, commonly known as the Angermann's twinflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the boreal forests of northern North America and parts of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its two small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is notable for its limited geographic distribution and its role in supporting local pollinators."
