    "intro": "Lucuma acreana, commonly known as the Andean lucuma, is a tropical plant native to the highlands of Peru. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces oval, golden-yellow fruits that are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, custard-like flavor. Its leaves are broad and hairy, adapted to the cool, high-altitude climate where it thrives. Lucuma acreana is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in the Andes."
