    "intro": "Lahia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a contrasting color at the base. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Lahia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
