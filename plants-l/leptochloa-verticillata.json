    "intro": "Leptochloa verticillata, commonly known as the clustered grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, whorled arrangement of leaves at the base of each stem. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
