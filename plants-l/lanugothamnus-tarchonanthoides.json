It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
