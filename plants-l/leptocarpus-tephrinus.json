    "intro": "Leptocarpus tephrinus, commonly known as the tephritic sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, often forming dense mats near the shoreline. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to maritime environments. Leptocarpus tephrinus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
