    "intro": "Lanthorus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of true dandelions. They are often found in grassy areas and are adapted to thrive in temperate climates. The genus is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and the production of achene fruits."
