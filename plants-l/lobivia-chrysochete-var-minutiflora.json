    "intro": "Lobivia chrysochete var. minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature yellow lobivia, is a compact cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem that often branches into multiple offsets, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique coloration and compact growth habit."
