    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. rupicola, commonly known as the rock privet, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common privet. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant is typically found growing on rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. It is relatively low-maintenance and tolerates poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in challenging sites."
