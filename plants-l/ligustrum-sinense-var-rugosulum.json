It features small, dark green, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in horticulture for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
