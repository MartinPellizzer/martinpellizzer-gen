    "intro": "Lessingia leptoclada var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lessingia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and narrow, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and the plant produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds."
