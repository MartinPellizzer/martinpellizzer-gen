    "intro": "Leria exscapa, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Leria exscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
