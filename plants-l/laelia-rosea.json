    "intro": "Laelia rosea, commonly known as the pink laelia, is a species of orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Laelia rosea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific climatic requirements."
