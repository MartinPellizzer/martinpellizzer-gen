    "intro": "Lyonia polita, commonly known as the silky lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Lyonia polita is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
