    "intro": "Loricalepis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic loricalepis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its unique, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt exposure and strong coastal winds. The plant exhibits a low, creeping growth habit, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky substrates near the shoreline. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically relying on wind pollination due to the absence of insect activity in its harsh environment. Loricalepis atlantica plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing coastal dunes and maintaining local biodiversity."
