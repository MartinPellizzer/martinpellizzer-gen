    "intro": "Leontopodium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or silver-gray inflorescence, which consists of many small, yellowish flowers surrounded by specialized bracts. The plant has basal leaves that are divided into narrow, grass-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a symbol of alpine beauty and resilience."
