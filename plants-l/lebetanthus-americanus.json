    "intro": "Lebetanthus americanus, commonly known as the American lebetanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
