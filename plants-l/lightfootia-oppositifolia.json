    "intro": "Lightfootia oppositifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens. The hardy, woody stems give it a rugged appearance, which is well adapted to its natural habitat."
