    "intro": "Llerasia macrocephala, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its showy, orange-red berries that resemble small lanterns. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The berries, while attractive, are toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
