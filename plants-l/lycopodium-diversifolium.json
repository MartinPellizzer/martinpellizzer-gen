    "intro": "Lycopodium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. Lycopodium diversifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of spores for scientific study highlights its ecological and botanical significance."
