    "intro": "Lecanorchis sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its unique floral morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection."
