    "intro": "Leea tetrasperma, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain four seeds, a feature reflected in its scientific name \"tetrasperma.\" It is often found growing on rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves. Leea tetrasperma is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties."
