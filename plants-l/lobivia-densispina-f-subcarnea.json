    "intro": "Lobivia densispina f. subcarnea, commonly known as the Woolly Lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features dense, woolly white to grayish hairs covering its stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a striking contrast to its textured foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
