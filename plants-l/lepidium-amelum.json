    "intro": "Lepidium amelum, commonly known as the bitter cress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in small clusters, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Lepidium amelum is characterized by its peppery, slightly bitter taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates."
