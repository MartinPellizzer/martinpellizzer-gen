    "intro": "Linum littorale var. littorale, commonly known as sea flax, is a coastal plant native to the shores of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, often succulent stems that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Sea flax is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
