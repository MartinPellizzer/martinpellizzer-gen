    "intro": "Lecocarpus leptolobus, commonly known as the slender-seeded sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The seeds are encased in a leathery, elongated pod, which helps in their dispersal by water."
