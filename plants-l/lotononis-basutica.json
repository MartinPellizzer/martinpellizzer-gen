    "intro": "Lotononis basutica, commonly known as the Basuto daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like inflorescence with white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range. Lotononis basutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
