    "intro": "Limnocharis flava, commonly known as the golden water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, and its leaves are broad, floating, and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
