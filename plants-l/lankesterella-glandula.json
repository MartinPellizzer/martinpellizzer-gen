    "intro": "Lankesterella glandula, commonly known as the glandular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed and often covered with tiny glands, giving it its common name. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Lankesterella glandula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
