    "intro": "Linum strictum var. inaequale, commonly known as the unequal flax, is a lesser-known variant of the flax plant. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals that are often unequal in size, giving the species its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry environments. This plant is less commonly cultivated than other flax varieties but is of interest to botanists and gardeners alike."
