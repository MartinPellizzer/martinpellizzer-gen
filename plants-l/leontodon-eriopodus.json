    "intro": "Leontodon eriopodus, commonly known as the hairy foot sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark brown, three-lobed seeds. Leontodon eriopodus is often found in open, sunny habitats and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
