    "intro": "Lupinus shockleyi, commonly known as Shockley's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
