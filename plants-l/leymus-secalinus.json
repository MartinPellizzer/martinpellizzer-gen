    "intro": "Leymus secalinus, commonly known as red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant produces spikelets with awns, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Red wheatgrass is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
