    "intro": "Leontopodium krasense, commonly known as the Kras edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps, particularly in regions of Italy and Austria. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow inflorescence, which resembles a dandelion. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are typically basal, with a thick, leathery texture, and the flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and is a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions."
