    "intro": "Lappula jessicae, commonly known as Jessica's lappula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
