    "intro": "Ledebouria weberi, commonly known as the Weber's bulbous hyacinth, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous form and striking, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Ledebouria weberi is also valued for its ability to store water in its bulb, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
