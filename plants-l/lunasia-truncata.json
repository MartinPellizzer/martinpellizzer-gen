    "intro": "Lunasia truncata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are truncate, meaning they end in a flat, blunt shape, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Lunasia truncata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
