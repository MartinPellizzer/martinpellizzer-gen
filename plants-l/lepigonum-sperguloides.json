    "intro": "Lepigonum sperguloides, commonly known as false knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive white-veined pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Lepigonum sperguloides is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
