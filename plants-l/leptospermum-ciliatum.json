    "intro": "Leptospermum ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens along the coast."
