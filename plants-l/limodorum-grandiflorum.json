    "intro": "Limodorum grandiflorum, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome and linear, grass-like leaves that grow from the base. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are often clustered in spikes. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in moist, nutrient-poor environments."
