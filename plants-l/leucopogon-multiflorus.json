    "intro": "Leucopogon multiflorus, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southern coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal heathlands and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or salty environment. Leucopogon multiflorus is known for its hardy nature and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
