    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum f. quercina, commonly known as the oak-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of the oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The shrub is often found in woodland edges and moist, shaded habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
