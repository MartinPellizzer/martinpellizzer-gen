    "intro": "Liparis nectarina, commonly known as the honey-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustering at the base of the plant. The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil."
