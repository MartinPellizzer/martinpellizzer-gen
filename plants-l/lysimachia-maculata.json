    "intro": "Lysimachia maculata, commonly known as the spotted deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive reddish or purplish spot near the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
