    "intro": "Linanthus liniflorus var. vallicola, commonly known as the valley linanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation in suitable habitats."
