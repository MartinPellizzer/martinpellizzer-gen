    "intro": "Lantana caudata, commonly known as the horseweed or West Indian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange to red. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Lantana caudata is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
