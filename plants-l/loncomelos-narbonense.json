    "intro": "Loncomelos narbonense, commonly known as the Narbonne's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in rocky and soil substrates. It is often found in temperate climates and is relatively uncommon in the wild. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
