It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
