    "intro": "Lathyrus nivalis, commonly known as the snow bean, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in the spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found at high altitudes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, bean-like pods containing small, dark seeds. Lathyrus nivalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
