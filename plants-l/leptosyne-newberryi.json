    "intro": "Leptosyne newberryi, commonly known as the Newberry's leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Leptosyne newberryi is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen."
