    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum nobukoanum, commonly known as the noble lemmaphyllum, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Lemnaceae, which includes the common water clovers, but differs in its terrestrial growth habit. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
