The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like clusters, producing a delicate, yellowish-green hue. Lomatium austiniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
