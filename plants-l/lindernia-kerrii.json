It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant purple or pink flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lindernia kerrii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last from spring to early autumn."
