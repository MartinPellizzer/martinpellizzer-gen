    "intro": "Lobelia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its size and habitat preferences, it is often used in native plant gardens to add color and ecological value."
