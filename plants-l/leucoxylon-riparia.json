    "intro": "Leucoxylon riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a flexible, branching structure that helps it withstand flood conditions. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Leucoxylon riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
