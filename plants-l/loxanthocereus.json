These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators like bats and moths. Loxanthocereus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in arid environments, making them popular among succulent enthusiasts. Their unique blooming pattern and striking appearance make them a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
