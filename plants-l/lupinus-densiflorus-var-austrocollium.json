It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for native pollinators."
