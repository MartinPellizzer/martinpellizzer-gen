    "intro": "Linum modestum, commonly known as common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, oval seeds. Linum modestum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It is closely related to the more well-known flax species, Linum usitatissimum, which is cultivated for its fibers and seeds."
