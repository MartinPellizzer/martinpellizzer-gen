    "intro": "Loranthus arboreus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
