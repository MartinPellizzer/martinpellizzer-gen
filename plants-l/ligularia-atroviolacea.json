    "intro": "Ligularia atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violaceous ligularia, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a distinctive purple or blackish underside. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, adding visual interest in late summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
