    "intro": "Loxocarya virgata, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Loxocarya virgata plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly by providing nectar for butterflies and other insects."
