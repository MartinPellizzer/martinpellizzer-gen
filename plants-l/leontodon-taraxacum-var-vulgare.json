    "intro": "Leontodon taraxacum var. vulgare, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
