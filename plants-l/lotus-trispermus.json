    "intro": "Lotus trispermus, commonly known as the three-seed lotus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces pods that contain three seeds, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist soil and is often found near water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. The lotus trispermus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
