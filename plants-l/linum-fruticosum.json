    "intro": "Linum fruticosum, commonly known as creeping flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for making textiles, similar to flax."
