    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of northern North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in pairs at the ends of its slender stems. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is distinguished by its smaller leaves and flowers compared to the typical Linnaea borealis. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
