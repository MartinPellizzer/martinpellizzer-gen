    "intro": "Lycopodium brevibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bracted clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its dense, moss-like appearance. L. brevibracteatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
