    "intro": "Liparis truncicola var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and dense spikes of pale green to white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps over time. This variety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other varieties within the Liparis genus."
