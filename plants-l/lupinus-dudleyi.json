    "intro": "Lupinus dudleyi, commonly known as Dudley's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus dudleyi is also notable for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
