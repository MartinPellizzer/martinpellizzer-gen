    "intro": "Luetkea, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, clover-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plants typically have delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of violet or blue. Luetkea species are often found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
