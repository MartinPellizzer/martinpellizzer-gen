It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces upright, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
