    "intro": "Lunathyrium acutum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved moonflower, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated margin, while the stems are hairy and often branching. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a specialty plant."
