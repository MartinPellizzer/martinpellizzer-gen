    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. linearifolius, commonly known as the slender marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are alternate, with elongated, linear leaflets that give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
