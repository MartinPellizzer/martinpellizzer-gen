    "intro": "Lilium primulinum var. poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's lily, is a rare and striking variant of the primrose lily. It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. This plant is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which stand out against its grassy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in open meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
