    "intro": "Lonchitis repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or desert areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
