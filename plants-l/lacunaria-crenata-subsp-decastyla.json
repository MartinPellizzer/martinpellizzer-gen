It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage with intricate patterns of lobes and indentations. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
