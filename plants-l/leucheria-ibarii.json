    "intro": "Leucheria ibarii, commonly known as the Ibari's leucheria, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucheria ibarii is considered an endangered species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
