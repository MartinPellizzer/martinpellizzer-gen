    "intro": "Lobadium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three parts. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Lobadium trifoliatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
