    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. randallii, commonly known as the Randall's lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
