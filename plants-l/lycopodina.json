    "intro": "Lycopodina, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. Lycopodina typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature common to many ancient plant groups. Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of vascular plants."
