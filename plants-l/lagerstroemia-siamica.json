    "intro": "Lagerstroemia siamica, commonly known as the Siamese crepe myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in summer, followed by elongated, fuzzy fruits. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and turn red or orange in autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
