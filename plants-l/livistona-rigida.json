It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Livistona rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions. Its growth habit makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments."
