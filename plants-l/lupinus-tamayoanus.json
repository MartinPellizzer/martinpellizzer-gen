    "intro": "Lupinus tamayoanus, commonly known as the Tamayo's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Lupinus tamayoanus is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
