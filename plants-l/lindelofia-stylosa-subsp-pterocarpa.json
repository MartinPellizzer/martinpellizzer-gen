It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The subspecies pterocarpa is distinguished by its elongated, winged fruits, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
