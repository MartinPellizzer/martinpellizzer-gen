It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and mild flavor, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
