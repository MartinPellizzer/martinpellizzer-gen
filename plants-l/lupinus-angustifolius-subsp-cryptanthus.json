    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subsp. cryptanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to other lupine species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and open woodlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
