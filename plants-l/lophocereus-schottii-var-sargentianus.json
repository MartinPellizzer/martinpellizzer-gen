    "intro": "Lophocereus schottii var. sargentianus, commonly known as the Sargent's night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems, which are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique flowering habit and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus enthusiasts."
