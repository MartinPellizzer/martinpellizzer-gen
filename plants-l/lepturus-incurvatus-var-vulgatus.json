    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus var. vulgatus, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth, with narrow, grass-like leaves that curl inward at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
