    "intro": "Leucanthemum corsicum f. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the Corsican dandelion, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often described as pinnatifid, meaning deeply lobed or split, giving it a delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of conservation interest."
