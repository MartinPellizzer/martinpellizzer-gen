    "intro": "Leptorkis bituberculata, commonly known as the two-ribbed liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy thallus, which is typically green and covered with small, tuberculate structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized clusters called gemma cups. Leptorkis bituberculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
