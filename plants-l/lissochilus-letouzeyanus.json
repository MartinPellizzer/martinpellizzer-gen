It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a rosette pattern, while the flowers are borne on elongated inflorescences. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
