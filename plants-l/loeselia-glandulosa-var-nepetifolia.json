    "intro": "Loeselia glandulosa var. nepetifolia, commonly known as the nepeta-leaved loeselia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, glandular-studded leaves that are typically opposite or whorled along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage has a distinct minty aroma, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils in the glandular structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
