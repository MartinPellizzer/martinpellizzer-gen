    "intro": "Lupinus semperflorens var. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of spiky, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The everblooming lupine is known for its long blooming period, which can extend from spring through early summer."
