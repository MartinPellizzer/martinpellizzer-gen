    "intro": "Limnophila chinensis subsp. aromatica, commonly known as sweet marshwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments. The subspecies is distinguished by its stronger fragrance compared to other members of the Limnophila genus."
