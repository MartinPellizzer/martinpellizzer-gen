    "intro": "Lupinus vaginatus, commonly known as the velvet lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a soft, velvety texture, which gives it its common name. Lupinus vaginatus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
