    "intro": "Lolium perenne f. microstachyum, commonly known as the fine-stemmed perennial ryegrass, is a botanical variant of perennial ryegrass characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit. It exhibits a dense, low-growing structure with fine leaves and reduced inflorescence size compared to the typical form. This form is often favored in turfgrass applications for its durability and wear tolerance. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is widely used in lawns and sports fields. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest in agricultural and horticultural research."
