    "intro": "Ligia passerina subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent shieldbug, is a species of plant in the family Leguminosae. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often in disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets. The flowers are usually small and clustered, producing pods that contain lens-shaped seeds."
