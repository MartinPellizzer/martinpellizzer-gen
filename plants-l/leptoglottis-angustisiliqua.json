    "intro": "Leptoglottis angustisiliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed flax, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, with a distinctive midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Leptoglottis angustisiliqua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
