    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea var. falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, thread-like hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged along the undersides of the fronds, and the spores are released during the wet season. This variant is distinguished by its slightly curved leaf tips, giving it a unique appearance among other lindsaea species."
