    "intro": "Lomelosia roberti, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, and it has a short, branching stem. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
