    "intro": "Liebigia dissimilis, commonly known as the dwarf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adhering layer on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
