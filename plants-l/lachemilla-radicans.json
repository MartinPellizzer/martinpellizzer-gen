    "intro": "Lachemilla radicans, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Lachemilla radicans thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
