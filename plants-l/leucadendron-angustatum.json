    "intro": "Leucadendron angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sugar bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Leucadendron angustatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
