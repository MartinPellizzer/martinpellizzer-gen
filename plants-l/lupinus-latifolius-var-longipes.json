It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, broad leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched flower clusters in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. This variety is valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and nitrogen fixation for soil enrichment."
