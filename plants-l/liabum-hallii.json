    "intro": "Liabum hallii, commonly known as the Hall's liabum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liabum hallii is considered a rare and endangered species."
