    "intro": "Lepidium latifolium subsp. affine, commonly known as the broadleaf peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits. The subspecies affine is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other subspecies of Lepidium latifolium."
