    "intro": "Lomandra filiformis subsp. flavior, commonly known as the golden lomandra, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and densely packed along the stems. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects."
