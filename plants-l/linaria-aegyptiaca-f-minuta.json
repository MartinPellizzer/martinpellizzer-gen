    "intro": "Linaria aegyptiaca f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf Egyptian toadflax, is a compact, low-growing plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It features slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. The foliage is narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve water in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
