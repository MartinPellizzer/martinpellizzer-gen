    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. aciculifolia, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, grass-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
