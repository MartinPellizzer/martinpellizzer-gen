    "intro": "Lathyrus canescens subvar. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
