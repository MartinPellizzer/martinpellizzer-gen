    "intro": "Lucilia recurva, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive blue eyes. The plant is not a botanical species but rather an insect, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. However, its larvae are often found on decaying organic matter, contributing to decomposition processes. This species is widely distributed and plays a role in ecological systems through its life cycle."
