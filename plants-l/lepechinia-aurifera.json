    "intro": "Lepechinia aurifera, commonly known as golden lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in regions with mild, moist climates. Its foliage is usually covered in a fine layer of white to silver hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
