    "intro": "Leptodermis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure and a greenish to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and tropical regions. Leptodermis lanceolata is often found in humid environments and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
