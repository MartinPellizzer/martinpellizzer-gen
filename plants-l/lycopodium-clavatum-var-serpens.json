    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. serpens, commonly known as the ground pine, is a clubmoss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to form extensive colonies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its primitive vascular plant classification. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings."
