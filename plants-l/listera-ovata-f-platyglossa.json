    "intro": "Listera ovata f. platyglossa, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its small, paired, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical Listera ovata. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its broader foliage and is often used in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
