    "intro": "Lotus forsteri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged, with showy pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and improve water quality. Lotus forsteri is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal."
