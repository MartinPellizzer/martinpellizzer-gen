    "intro": "Laserocarpum pseudomeum, commonly known as the false blackwood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing one or two seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in tropical rainforest ecosystems, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its family."
