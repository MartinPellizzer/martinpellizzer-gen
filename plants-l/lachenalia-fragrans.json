    "intro": "Lachenalia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented lachenalia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid native environment. Its fragrant blooms, which range in color from white to pale yellow, attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Lachenalia fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with bright light."
