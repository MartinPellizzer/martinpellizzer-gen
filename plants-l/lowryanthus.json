It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or woolly in texture. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink, purple, or white, blooming in clusters. Lowryanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
