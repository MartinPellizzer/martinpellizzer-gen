    "intro": "Lomariopsis boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or forested substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
