It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and hairy leaves, typical of the Papaveraceae family. Its unique seed pods, which split open with a popping sound when mature, give it its common name. Linum crepitans thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
