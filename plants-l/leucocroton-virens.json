It is characterized by its striking, glossy green leaves that often have a waxy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
