    "intro": "Lepanthes garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a short, slender stem with a few leaves and produces small, showy blooms that bloom during the wet season. Lepanthes garciae is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and it relies on humid, shaded environments for survival. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a rare and valuable species in the orchid family."
