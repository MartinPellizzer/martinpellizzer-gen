    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. seringianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional use in cultural and medicinal practices."
