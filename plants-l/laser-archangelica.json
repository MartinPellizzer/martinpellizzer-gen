    "intro": "Laser archangelica, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
