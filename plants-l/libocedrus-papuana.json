It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Libocedrus papuana is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for construction and crafts."
