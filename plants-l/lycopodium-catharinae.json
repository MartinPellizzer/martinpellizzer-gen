    "intro": "Lycopodium catharinae, commonly known as the Catharina clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, spore-producing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This species is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it grows in rocky soils and humid forests. Its reproductive structures are similar to those of other clubmosses, with spores released from specialized cones. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lycopodium catharinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
