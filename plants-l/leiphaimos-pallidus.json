    "intro": "Leiphaimos pallidus, commonly known as the pale leiphaimos, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
