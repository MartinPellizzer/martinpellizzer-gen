    "intro": "Limonium quinnii, commonly known as the Quinny sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spires of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium quinnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
