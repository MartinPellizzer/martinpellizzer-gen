    "intro": "Lotus arabicus var. torulosus, commonly known as the horned lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. The lotus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
