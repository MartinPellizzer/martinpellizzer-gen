    "intro": "Liabum vaginans, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Liabum vaginans is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
