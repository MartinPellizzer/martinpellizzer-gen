    "intro": "Lavoisiera uliginosa, commonly known as the bog lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Lavoisiera uliginosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
