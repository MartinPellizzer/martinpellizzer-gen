    "intro": "Lessertia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed lessertia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
