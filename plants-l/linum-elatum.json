    "intro": "Linum elatum, commonly known as the common flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linum elatum is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce linseed oil, and for its fibers, which have been historically used in textile production. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
