It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
