    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. porophyllum, commonly known as the red clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the western United States. It features a dense, cushion-like growth habit with tiny, scale-like leaves that are bright red to orange in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and coloration make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its habitat."
