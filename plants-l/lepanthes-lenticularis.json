It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the true lily of the valley. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid's unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
