    "intro": "Lepanthes microscopica, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that are often less than a centimeter in size. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
