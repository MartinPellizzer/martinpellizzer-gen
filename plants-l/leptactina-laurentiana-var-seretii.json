    "intro": "Leptactina laurentiana var. seretii, commonly known as the Laurentian seretii lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its greenish-yellow to pale yellowish thallus. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in moist, temperate forests. The thallus is loosely branched, with distinct lobes and a smooth, leathery texture. It contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions and resistance to environmental stressors. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality and forest health."
