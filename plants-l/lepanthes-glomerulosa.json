    "intro": "Lepanthes glomerulosa, commonly known as the clustered slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and slightly fleshy, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Lepanthes glomerulosa is often found growing in the understory of rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
