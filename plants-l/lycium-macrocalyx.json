    "intro": "Lycium macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along creek banks. Lycium macrocalyx plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
