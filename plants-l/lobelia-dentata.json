    "intro": "Lobelia dentata, commonly known as the toothed lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces striking blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. Lobelia dentata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
