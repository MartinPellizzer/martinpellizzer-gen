    "intro": "Limonium fruticosum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. Limonium fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
