    "intro": "Lyrocarpa xanti, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its botanical features include a low-growing shrub form with hairy stems and pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Lyrocarpa xanti plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
