    "intro": "Linum angustifolium f. arenicola, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a rare variant of the narrow-leaved flax. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers. This plant is adapted to grow in sandy or coastal environments, showing tolerance to salt spray and well-drained soils. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for native insects."
