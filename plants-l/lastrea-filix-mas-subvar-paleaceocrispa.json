    "intro": "Lastrea filix-mas subvar. paleaceocrispa, commonly known as the paleaceocrispa variety of the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The leaves often have a distinctive waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance and aiding in moisture retention. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue to black berries. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for hedging and ground cover in gardens."
