    "intro": "Lycopodium sinense, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and upright growth habit. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium sinense is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique botanical features make it a valuable species for studying ancient plant lineages and ecological adaptations."
