    "intro": "Linanthus parviflorus var. luteolus, commonly known as the yellow flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
