    "intro": "Leptorkis habenarina, commonly known as the Habeana orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
