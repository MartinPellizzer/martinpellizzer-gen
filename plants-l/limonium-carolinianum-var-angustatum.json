    "intro": "Limonium carolinianum var. angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy coastal habitats, where it thrives in brackish or saline conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
