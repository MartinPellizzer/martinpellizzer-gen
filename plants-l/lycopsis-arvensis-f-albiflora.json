    "intro": "Lycopsis arvensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered field lycopsis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in temperate regions. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
