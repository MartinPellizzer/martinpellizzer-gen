    "intro": "Loranthus americanus, commonly known as the American mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various hardwood trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a leathery texture, and it flowers in the spring with small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers. Loranthus americanus is often found in forested areas across the eastern United States."
