It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Lygodium polymorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
