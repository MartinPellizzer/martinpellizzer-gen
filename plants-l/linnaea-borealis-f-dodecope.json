    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. dodecope, commonly known as the northern twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Europe. This low-growing perennial herb features small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The f. dodecope form is distinguished by its unique floral structure, with twelve stamens instead of the usual eight."
