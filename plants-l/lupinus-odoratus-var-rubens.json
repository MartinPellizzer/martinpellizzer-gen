    "intro": "Lupinus odoratus var. rubens, commonly known as the crimson lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, crimson-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves and produces legumes as its fruit, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
