    "intro": "Lobelia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Lobelia microcarpa is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
