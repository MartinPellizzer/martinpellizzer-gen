    "intro": "Latourorchis spectabilis, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has rhizomatous roots that help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Latourorchis spectabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
