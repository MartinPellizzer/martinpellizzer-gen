    "intro": "Lycoctonum loczyanum, commonly known as the Loczyanum lycotone, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and velvety, dark green foliage. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with certain mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as nocturnal moths. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Lycoctonum loczyanum is considered a conservation priority."
