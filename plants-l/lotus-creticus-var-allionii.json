    "intro": "Lotus creticus var. allionii, commonly known as the Cretan lotus, is a rare and ancient species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are typical of the Lotus genus. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
