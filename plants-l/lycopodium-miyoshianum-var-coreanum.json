    "intro": "Lycopodium miyoshianum var. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of East Asia. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
