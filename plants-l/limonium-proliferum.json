    "intro": "Limonium proliferum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of the United States. It is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in salty, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray. Limonium proliferum is also a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
