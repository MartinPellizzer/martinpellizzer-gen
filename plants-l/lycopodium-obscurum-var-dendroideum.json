    "intro": "Lycopodium obscurum var. dendroideum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. This variety is noted for its slow growth and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
