    "intro": "Ligustrum uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that persist through the winter. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for urinary tract support. Ligustrum uva-ursi is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
