    "intro": "Leptospermum lanigerum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited tea tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer. Its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its larger, more robust fruits compared to other varieties of the species."
