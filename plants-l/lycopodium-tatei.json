It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium tatei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in containers. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporophylls that produce spores rather than flowers."
