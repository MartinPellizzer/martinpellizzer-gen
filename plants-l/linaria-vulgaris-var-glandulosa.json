    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with small glandular hairs, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, rocky habitats. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
