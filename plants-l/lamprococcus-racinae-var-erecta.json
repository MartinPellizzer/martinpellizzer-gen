It typically exhibits a compact growth habit with erect, slender stems that bear small, clustered leaves. The plant's foliage is often a deep green, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
