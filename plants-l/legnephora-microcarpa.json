    "intro": "Legnephora microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited legnephora, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
