    "intro": "Lespedeza intermedia, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Lespedeza intermedia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
