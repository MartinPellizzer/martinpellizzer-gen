    "intro": "Lepidium filicaule, commonly known as the fern-like cress, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the mustard family. Lepidium filicaule is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
