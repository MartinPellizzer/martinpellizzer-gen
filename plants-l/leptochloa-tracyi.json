    "intro": "Leptochloa tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, annual grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in its native range."
