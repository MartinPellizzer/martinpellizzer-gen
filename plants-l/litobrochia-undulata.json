    "intro": "Litobrochia undulata, commonly known as the undulating rock fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled or undulated, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or in humid, tropical forests. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Litobrochia undulata plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
