    "intro": "Lysimachia rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf chickweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are round or oval in shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Lysimachia rotundifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
