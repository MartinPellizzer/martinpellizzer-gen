    "intro": "Lupinus sabuli, commonly known as sand lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has feathery, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Lupinus sabuli plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
