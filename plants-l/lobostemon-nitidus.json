    "intro": "Lobostemon nitidus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
