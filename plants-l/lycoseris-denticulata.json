    "intro": "Lycoseris denticulata, commonly known as the toothed lycoperd, is a species of fungus in the family Lycoperdaceae. It is a saprophytic fungus that decomposes organic matter, playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. The fruiting bodies of Lycoseris denticulata are small, with a distinctive toothed or scalloped cap. It is typically found in damp, shaded areas, often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter. This fungus is not considered edible and is more of a decomposer than a parasite."
