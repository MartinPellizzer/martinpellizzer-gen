    "intro": "Lycoseris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that often resemble sea urchins, hence its common name. The plants typically have silver or gray-green foliage with a waxy coating, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments. Lycoseris species are native to regions around the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing in coastal or saline soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
