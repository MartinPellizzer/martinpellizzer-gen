It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or salty soils and is often found in dune environments. Limonium retusum is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
