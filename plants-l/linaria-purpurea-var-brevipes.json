    "intro": "Linaria purpurea var. brevipes, commonly known as the purple toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
