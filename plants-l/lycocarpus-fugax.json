    "intro": "Lycocarpus fugax, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Lycocarpus fugax is considered a vulnerable species."
