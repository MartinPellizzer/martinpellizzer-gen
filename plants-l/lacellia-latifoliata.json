    "intro": "Lacellia latifoliata, commonly known as the broadleaf lacellia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
