    "intro": "Lastrea spinescens, commonly known as the spiny lastrea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
