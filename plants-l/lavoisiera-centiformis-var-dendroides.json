    "intro": "Lavoisiera centiformis var. dendroides, commonly known as the tree lavoisiera, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems forming a tree-like structure. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
