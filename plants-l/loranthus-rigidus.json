    "intro": "Loranthus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia species. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, and it thrives in warm, temperate climates. Loranthus rigidus plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals."
