The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough or hairy texture, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
