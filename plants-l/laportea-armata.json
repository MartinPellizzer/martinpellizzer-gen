    "intro": "Laportea armata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Laportea armata thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
