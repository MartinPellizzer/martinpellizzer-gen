    "intro": "Lamium maculatum, commonly known as spotted deadnettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive purple or red markings, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium maculatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
