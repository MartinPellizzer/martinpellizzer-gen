    "intro": "Lotus arvensis, commonly known as the field lotus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, which helps in soil stabilization. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by water or wind, contributing to its spread in wetland habitats."
