It is characterized by its distinctive bicolor flowers, which typically feature white petals with a pink or red center. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing resistance to salt spray and wind. It produces fluffy, seed-filled pods that disperse its seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
