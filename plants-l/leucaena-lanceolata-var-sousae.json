    "intro": "Leucaena lanceolata var. sousae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in agroforestry and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it valuable for soil improvement and livestock feed."
