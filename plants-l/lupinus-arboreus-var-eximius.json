    "intro": "Lupinus arboreus var. eximius, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue to lavender flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, oval seeds. Lupinus arboreus var. eximius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
