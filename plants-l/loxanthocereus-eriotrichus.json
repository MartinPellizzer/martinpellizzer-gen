    "intro": "Loxanthocereus eriotrichus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. The species is also notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
