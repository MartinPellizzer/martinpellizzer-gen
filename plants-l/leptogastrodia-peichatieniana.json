It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
