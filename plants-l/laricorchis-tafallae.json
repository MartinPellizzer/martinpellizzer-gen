It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has a short, upright stem with a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
