    "intro": "Leontopodium fauriei, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its growth is slow, and it often forms a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. Due to its beauty and association with alpine landscapes, it is a symbol of resilience and is often cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
