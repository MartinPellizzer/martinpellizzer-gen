    "intro": "Lepanthes domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican nightshade, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom at night, a feature that aligns with its name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient photosynthesis. The orchid's flowers are often pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by nocturnal insects."
