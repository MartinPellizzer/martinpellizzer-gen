It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant is an evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical forest environments. Its fruit is a hard, woody nut enclosed in a spiny cupule, which is a distinctive feature of the genus. This variant is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
