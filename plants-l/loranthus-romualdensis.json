    "intro": "Loranthus romualdensis, commonly known as the Romuald's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It primarily grows on the branches of native Australian eucalyptus trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves. Its small, white or greenish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
