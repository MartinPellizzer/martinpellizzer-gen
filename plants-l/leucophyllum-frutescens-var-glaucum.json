    "intro": "Leucophyllum frutescens var. glaucum, commonly known as silverleaf mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
