    "intro": "Lambertia barbata, commonly known as the coastal lambertia, is a species native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces bright red, tubular flowers that attract birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Its leaves are opposite and narrow, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Lambertia barbata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
