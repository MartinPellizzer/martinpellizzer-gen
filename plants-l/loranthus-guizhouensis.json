    "intro": "Loranthus guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to China. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and primarily attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as Ficus species. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some benefits through nitrogen fixation. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are usually arranged in pairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often visited by insects. This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting biodiversity."
