    "intro": "Leria nutans f. integrifolia, commonly known as the spreading leria, is a variant of the leria plant characterized by its broad, smooth leaves. It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, which is a distinguishing feature of the integrifolia form. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
