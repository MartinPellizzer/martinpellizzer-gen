    "intro": "Lindsaea malayensis, commonly known as the Malay basket fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has a creeping rhizome with numerous erect, linear fronds that are usually dark green and covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and they are protected by a round, glandular indusium. Lindsaea malayensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
