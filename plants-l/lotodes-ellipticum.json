    "intro": "Lotodes ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
