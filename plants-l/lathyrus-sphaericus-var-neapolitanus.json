    "intro": "Lathyrus sphaericus var. neapolitanus, commonly known as the Neapolitan pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spherical, inflated pods that resemble small balloons, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white, and its leaves are trifoliate, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. The Neapolitan pea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique appearance."
