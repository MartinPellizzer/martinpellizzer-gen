    "intro": "Leontopodium pusillum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
