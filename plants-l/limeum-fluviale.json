    "intro": "Limeum fluviale, commonly known as the river lime, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Limeum fluviale thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
