    "intro": "Lindsaea caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can extend up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Lindsaea caudata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
