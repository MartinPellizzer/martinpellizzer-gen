    "intro": "Lotus palustris var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, supporting its growth in shallow, still waters. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in ponds and water gardens."
