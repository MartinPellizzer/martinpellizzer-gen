    "intro": "Leontopodium melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers surrounded by a cluster of dark brown bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its unique appearance makes it a symbol of resilience and beauty in harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often protected in its natural habitats."
