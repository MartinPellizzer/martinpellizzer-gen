    "intro": "Leptochloa virgata f. nana, commonly known as dwarf leptochloa, is a compact, mat-forming grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover."
