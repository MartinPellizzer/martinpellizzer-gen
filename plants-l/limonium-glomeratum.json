    "intro": "Limonium glomeratum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Limonium glomeratum is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
