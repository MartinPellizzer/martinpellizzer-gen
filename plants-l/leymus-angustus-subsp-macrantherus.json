It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed lemmas, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and steppe habitats. This subspecies is valued for its erosion control capabilities and forage potential in arid environments."
