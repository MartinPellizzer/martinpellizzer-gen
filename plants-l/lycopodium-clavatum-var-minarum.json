It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
