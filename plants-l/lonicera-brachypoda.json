    "intro": "Lonicera brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stem honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red, fleshy, and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as those of other honeysuckle species. Lonicera brachypoda is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
