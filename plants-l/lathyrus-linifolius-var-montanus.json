    "intro": "Lathyrus linifolius var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats to anchor itself in unstable soils. Its trifoliate leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in alpine regions."
