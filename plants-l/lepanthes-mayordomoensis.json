    "intro": "Lepanthes mayordomoensis, commonly known as the Mayordomo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America, particularly found in the humid cloud forests of Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, often leafless stem and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer months, and its flowers are characterized by their intricate, spurred petals. Lepanthes mayordomoensis is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
