    "intro": "Lycopodium verticillatum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant forms dense mats of foliage, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores necessary for propagation. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations to its habitat."
