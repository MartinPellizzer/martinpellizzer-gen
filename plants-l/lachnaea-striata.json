    "intro": "Lachnaea striata, commonly known as the striped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lichenes. It is characterized by its distinct, striated thallus that appears in shades of yellow to orange. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
