    "intro": "Loranthus sacleuxii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host tree, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in dense forests."
