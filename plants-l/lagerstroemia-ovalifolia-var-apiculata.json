    "intro": "Lagerstroemia ovalifolia var. apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy on top. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the peeling, mottled bark that reveals layers of different colors. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
