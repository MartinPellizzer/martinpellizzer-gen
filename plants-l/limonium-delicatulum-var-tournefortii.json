    "intro": "Limonium delicatulum var. tournefortii, commonly known as the Sea Holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its succulent stems and fleshy leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
