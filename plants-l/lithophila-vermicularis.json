    "intro": "Lithophila vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping lithophila, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lithophila vermicularis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
