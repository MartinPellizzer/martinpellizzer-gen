    "intro": "Lathyrus ciliatus, commonly known as the fringed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has compound leaves with finely toothed edges. Its seed pods are slender and contain several elliptical seeds. Lathyrus ciliatus is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
