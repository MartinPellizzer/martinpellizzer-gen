    "intro": "Lisianthius viscidiflorus, commonly known as the stickyflower lisianthius, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its leaves and stems a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
