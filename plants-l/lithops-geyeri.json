    "intro": "Lithops geyeri, commonly known as the Cape Town lithops, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, which helps it blend into its arid environment. The plant features two pairs of fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that store water, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring. Lithops geyeri thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates. Its unique morphology and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
