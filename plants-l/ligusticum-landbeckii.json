    "intro": "Ligusticum landbeckii, commonly known as the alpine ginseng, is a rare perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
