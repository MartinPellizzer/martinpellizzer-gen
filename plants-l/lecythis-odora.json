    "intro": "Lecythis odora, commonly known as the sweet-scented lecythium, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces distinctive, helmet-shaped fruits that contain a single, large, edible seed encased in a thick, fibrous pulp. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. Its unique fragrance and ecological importance make it a notable species in biodiversity-rich ecosystems."
