    "intro": "Lycaste lata, commonly known as the pale lycaste, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Lycaste lata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
