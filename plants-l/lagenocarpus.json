    "intro": "Lagenocarpus, commonly known as the false sago palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their large, fan-shaped leaves and stout, clustered stems. They are often mistaken for true sago palms due to their similar appearance. Botanically, Lagenocarpus is notable for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
