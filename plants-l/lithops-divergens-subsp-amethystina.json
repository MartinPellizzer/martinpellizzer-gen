    "intro": "Lithops divergens subsp. amethystina, commonly known as the Cape Town stone plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically pale green to bluish-gray, with intricate patterns that help it blend into its surroundings. Lithops divergens subsp. amethystina is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal watering and well-draining soil."
