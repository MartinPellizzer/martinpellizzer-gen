    "intro": "Lepanthes maldonadoae, commonly known as the Maldonado's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it capture moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
