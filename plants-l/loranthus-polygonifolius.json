    "intro": "Loranthus polygonifolius, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to China and is often found growing on various hardwood trees."
