    "intro": "Leucolaena rotundifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy roundleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, round leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its woody stems and adaptability to poor soils make it a useful plant in reforestation and erosion control efforts. The species is also valued for its potential in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
