    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. integerrima, commonly known as the northern beauty or twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive pair of opposite, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable indicator species for early successional habitats."
