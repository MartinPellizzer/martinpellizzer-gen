    "intro": "Lophophora diffusa var. koehresii, commonly known as the Koehres' peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. It produces a dense cluster of white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, thick stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly mescaline, which has psychoactive properties. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional use in spiritual practices."
