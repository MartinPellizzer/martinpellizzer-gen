It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a toothed margin, contributing to its common name. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms."
