    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum f. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming honeysuckle, is a cultivar of the common honeysuckle. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often preferred by birds over humans. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for hedging or as a climbing plant, though it requires regular pruning to maintain shape. The foliage is typically dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its showy floral display."
