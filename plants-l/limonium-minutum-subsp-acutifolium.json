    "intro": "Limonium minutum subsp. acutifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
