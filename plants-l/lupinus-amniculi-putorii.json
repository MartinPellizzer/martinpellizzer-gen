    "intro": "Lupinus amniculi-putorii, commonly known as the Putorii Lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spindly, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
