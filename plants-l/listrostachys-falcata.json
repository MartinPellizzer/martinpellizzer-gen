    "intro": "Listrostachys falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, ascending stems with small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
