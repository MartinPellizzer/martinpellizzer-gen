    "intro": "Lonchitis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Lonchitis pubescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
