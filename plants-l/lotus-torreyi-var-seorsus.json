    "intro": "Lotus torreyi var. seorsus, commonly known as the Torrey's lotus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it obtain essential nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
