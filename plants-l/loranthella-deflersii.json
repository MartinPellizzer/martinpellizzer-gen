    "intro": "Loranthella deflersii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Loranthella deflersii is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on various host trees such as teak and rosewood."
