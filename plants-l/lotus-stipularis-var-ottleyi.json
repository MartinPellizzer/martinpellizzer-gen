It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The Otto's lotus is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
