    "intro": "Linosyris punctata, commonly known as the dotted linseed plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Linosyris punctata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
