    "intro": "Larix potaninii subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan larch, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding, making it a deciduous conifer. The tree typically grows in high-altitude areas, often in mountainous regions with cold climates. Its cones are woody and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
