    "intro": "Lasiocladus linearifolius var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring. Its hairy foliage and drought-resistant adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
