It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring prominent, spiny areoles and a ribbed stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant."
