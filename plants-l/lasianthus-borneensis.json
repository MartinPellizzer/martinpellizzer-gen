    "intro": "Lasianthus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles and are usually white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
