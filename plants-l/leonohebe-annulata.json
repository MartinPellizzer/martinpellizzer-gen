    "intro": "Leonohebe annulata, commonly known as the silver leaf hebe, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across the Pacific region."
