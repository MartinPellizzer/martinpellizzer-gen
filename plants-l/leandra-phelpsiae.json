    "intro": "Leandra phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' leandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and dark green color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leandra phelpsiae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
