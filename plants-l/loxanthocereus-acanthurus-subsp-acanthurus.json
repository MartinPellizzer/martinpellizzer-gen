    "intro": "Loxanthocereus acanthurus subsp. acanthurus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
