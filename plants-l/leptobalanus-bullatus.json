    "intro": "Leptobalanus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate spruce, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and fleshy cones that are often covered in a waxy layer, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant has needle-like leaves that are short and dense, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Leptobalanus bullatus is considered a vulnerable species."
