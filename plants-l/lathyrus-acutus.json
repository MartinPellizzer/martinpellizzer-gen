    "intro": "Lathyrus acutus, commonly known as the sharp-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus acutus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration. However, some species within the genus can produce toxic compounds, though the specific toxicity of Lathyrus acutus remains less well-documented."
