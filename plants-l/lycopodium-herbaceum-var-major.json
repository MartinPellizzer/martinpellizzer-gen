    "intro": "Lycopodium herbaceum var. major, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with a dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophytes produce spores in clusters called strobila, which are released into the air for dispersal. This plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
