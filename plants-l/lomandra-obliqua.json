    "intro": "Lomandra obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikes of white or pale blue flowers in spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. Lomandra obliqua is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
