    "intro": "Laportea repens, commonly known as creeping laportea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hairy, and often have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Laportea repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
