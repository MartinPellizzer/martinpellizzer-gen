    "intro": "[WRONG START] Larix wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the genus Larix, which includes species commonly referred to as larches. This species is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall before shedding, a trait shared with other larch species. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
