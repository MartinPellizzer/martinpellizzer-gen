    "intro": "Lappula polymorpha, commonly known as the common lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each stem. The seeds are enclosed in a membranous capsule that splits open when mature to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
