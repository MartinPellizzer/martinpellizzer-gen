    "intro": "Lepanthes jimburae, commonly known as the Jimbura Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highlands of Costa Rica. It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
