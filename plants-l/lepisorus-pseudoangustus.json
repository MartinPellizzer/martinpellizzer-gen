    "intro": "Lepisorus pseudoangustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Lepisorus pseudoangustus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings where humidity is high."
