    "intro": "Laserpitium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic lasur, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Laserpitium atlanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
