It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a popular choice for both horticultural and botanical study."
