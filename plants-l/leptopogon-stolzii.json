    "intro": "Leptopogon stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to reddish-purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
