    "intro": "Lithocardium limum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often arranged in clusters. Lithocardium limum is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking presence to its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
