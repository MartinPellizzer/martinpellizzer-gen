    "intro": "Lycopodiella limosa, commonly known as the bog huperzia, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a rosette-like appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in bogs and wetlands, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. Lycopodiella limosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
