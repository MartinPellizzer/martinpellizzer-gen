It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a small tree, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Leschenaultia drummondiana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
