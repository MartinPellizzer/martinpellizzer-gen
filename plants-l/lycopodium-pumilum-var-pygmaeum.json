    "intro": "Lycopodium pumilum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing no taller than a few centimeters, and its dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
