    "intro": "Laelia violacea, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal. Laelia violacea is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific climate requirements."
