    "intro": "Lycopodium selago subsp. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in cold, arctic environments. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. This subspecies is adapted to harsh conditions, such as permafrost and nutrient-poor soils, and is often found in tundra and alpine regions. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
