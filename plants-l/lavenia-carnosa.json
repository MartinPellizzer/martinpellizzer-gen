    "intro": "Lavenia carnosa, commonly known as the woolly lavenia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Lavenia carnosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique texture and foliage."
