    "intro": "Linaria pedicellata, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the common snapdragon. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Linaria pedicellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
