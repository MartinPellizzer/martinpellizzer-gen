    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus subsp. argenteus, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Silver lupine is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
