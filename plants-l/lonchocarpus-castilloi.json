    "intro": "Lonchocarpus castilloi, commonly known as the Mexican climbing bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supporting structures. The plant produces striking yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, making it an important plant in agricultural systems."
