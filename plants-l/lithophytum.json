    "intro": "Lithophytum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. Lithophytum species are native to various regions, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their compact growth habit and often produce showy, fragrant flowers. Due to their unique growth patterns and ornamental value, they are popular in horticulture and conservation efforts."
