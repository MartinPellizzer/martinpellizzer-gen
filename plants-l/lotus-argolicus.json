It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along coastal areas. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. The seeds are encased in a tough pod, which splits open to release the seeds when mature."
