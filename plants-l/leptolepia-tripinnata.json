It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into three main parts, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, making it a unique and visually striking plant."
