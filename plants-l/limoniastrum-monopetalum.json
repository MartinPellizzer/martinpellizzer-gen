    "intro": "Limoniastrum monopetalum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that thrives in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Limoniastrum monopetalum is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
