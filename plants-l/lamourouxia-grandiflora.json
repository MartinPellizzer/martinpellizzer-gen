    "intro": "Lamourouxia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
