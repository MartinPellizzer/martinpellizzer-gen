    "intro": "Limnophila heterophylla var. reflexa, commonly known as water hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairless and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective plant for stabilizing aquatic habitats."
