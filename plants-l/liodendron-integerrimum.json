    "intro": "Liodendron integerrimum, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a thallus composed of a dense, leaf-like structure with a dark green to black upper surface and a white, powdery lower surface. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an indicator of environmental stability and air quality."
