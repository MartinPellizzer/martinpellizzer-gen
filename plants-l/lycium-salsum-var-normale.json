    "intro": "Lycium salsum var. normale, commonly known as the coastal boxthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for humans and birds but are often avoided due to their bitter taste. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its structure provides habitat for various wildlife, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
