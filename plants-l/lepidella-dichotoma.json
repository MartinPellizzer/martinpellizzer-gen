    "intro": "Lepidella dichotoma, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts at each node. The plant forms dense mats on moist, shaded rocky surfaces, typically in temperate regions. Its leaves are closely appressed to the stem and lack a distinct midrib. Lepidella dichotoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native environments."
