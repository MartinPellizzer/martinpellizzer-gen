    "intro": "Lonchocarpus gyroides, commonly known as the yellow snakeroot, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, curved pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in horticulture but has been studied for its potential medicinal applications."
