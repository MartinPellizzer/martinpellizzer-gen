    "intro": "Lysiana exocarpi subsp. exocarpi, commonly known as the common wax apple, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree with simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a woody, spherical berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy cuticle on both leaves and fruits, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a sweet and tart flavor."
