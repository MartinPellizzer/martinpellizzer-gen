    "intro": "Lygos dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded lygos, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant features a robust, branching stem with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small, hard seeds."
