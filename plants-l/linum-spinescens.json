    "intro": "Linum spinescens, commonly known as spiked flax, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Linum spinescens is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and historical association with flax cultivation."
