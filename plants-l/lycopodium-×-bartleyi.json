    "intro": "Lycopodium \u00d7 bartleyi, commonly known as the Bartley's clubmoss, is a hybrid species within the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with both male and female cones occurring on the same individual. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, offering insights into the evolutionary history of early vascular plants."
