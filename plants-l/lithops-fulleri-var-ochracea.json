    "intro": "Lithops fulleri var. ochracea, commonly known as the \"earthen leaf\" or \"tawny lithops,\" is a species of succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pair of thick, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a textured surface that aids in moisture retention. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
