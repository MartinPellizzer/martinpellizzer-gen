    "intro": "Loranthus murrayi var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to host trees through haustoria, drawing nutrients and water from its host. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, growing on the branches of various host trees."
