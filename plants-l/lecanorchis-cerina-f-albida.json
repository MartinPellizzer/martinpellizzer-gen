    "intro": "Lecanorchis cerina f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on aerial roots for attachment and nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
