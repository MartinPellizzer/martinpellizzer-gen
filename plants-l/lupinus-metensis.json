    "intro": "Lupinus metensis, commonly known as the Meteora lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Lupinus metensis plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
