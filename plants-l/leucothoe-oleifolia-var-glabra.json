    "intro": "Leucothoe oleifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth-leaved waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and waxy, with a bluish-green hue on top and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, elliptical berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide seasonal interest in woodland gardens."
