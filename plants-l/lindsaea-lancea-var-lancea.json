    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea var. lancea, commonly known as the lance-leaf spikemoss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Lindsaea lancea var. lancea plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity by contributing to the microhabitats of its ecosystem."
