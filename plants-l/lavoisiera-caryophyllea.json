It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
