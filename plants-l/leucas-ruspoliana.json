    "intro": "Leucas ruspoliana, commonly known as the mountain leucas, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Leucas ruspoliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
