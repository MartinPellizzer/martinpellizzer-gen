    "intro": "Limnodea arkansana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy water willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to wetland environments, making it an important species in riparian habitats. Limnodea arkansana var. pilosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
