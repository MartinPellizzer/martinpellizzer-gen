    "intro": "Luzula nemorosa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to greenish-white flowers in early to mid-summer. Its inflorescence is characterized by dense, spike-like clusters of bracts that enclose the tiny flowers. Luzula nemorosa var. parviflora is often found in association with other woodland flora and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
