    "intro": "Lotus cytisoides subsp. drepanocarpus, commonly known as the prickly lotus, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions."
