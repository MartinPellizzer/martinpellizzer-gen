    "intro": "Larix kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo larch, is a species of larch native to the Himalayas, specifically in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in autumn, revealing its distinctive cone-bearing branches. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh mountain climates. The cones of Larix kongboensis are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
