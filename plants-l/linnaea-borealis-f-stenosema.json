    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. stenosema, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, thriving in acidic soil conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. This form is less common than the typical twinflower and is often found in specific, isolated populations."
