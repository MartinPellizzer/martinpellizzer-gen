    "intro": "Lycopodium tobarii, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and sporophytic structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodium tobarii reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature common among primitive vascular plants. Its presence in high-altitude regions indicates its adaptation to cooler, humid climates."
