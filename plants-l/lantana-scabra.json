    "intro": "Lantana scabra, commonly known as rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may require careful management to prevent spread."
