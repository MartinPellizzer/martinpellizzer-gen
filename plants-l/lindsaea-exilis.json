    "intro": "Lindsaea exilis, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many plants adapted to humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, elongated leaves that form a rosette, often with a central cavity used to collect water. Its reproductive structures, known as spores, are produced in specialized leaf structures called sporangia. Lindsaea exilis is often found growing on trees or rocks in moist, shaded habitats."
