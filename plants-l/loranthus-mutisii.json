    "intro": "Loranthus mutisii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves both aerial and root systems, with seeds germinating on host bark. Loranthus mutisii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing the health and diversity of the forest canopy."
