    "intro": "Lantana insularis, commonly known as the island lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the stage of bloom. Lantana insularis is characterized by its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can also be invasive in certain regions."
