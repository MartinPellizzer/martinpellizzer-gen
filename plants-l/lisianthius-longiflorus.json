It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a prominent central disk.

Its long, slender flower stems contribute to its ornamental value and make it suitable for cut flower production."
