    "intro": "Larbrea palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Larbrea palustris is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
