    "intro": "Leontopodium delavayanum, commonly known as the Delavay's edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western China. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing at elevations above 3,000 meters where the climate is cold and the soil is rocky. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
