    "intro": "Lagopus bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's moss campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features woolly or hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine or rocky habitats. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in cold, arid environments. Its flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
