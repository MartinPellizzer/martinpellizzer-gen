    "intro": "Lycianthes pustulata, commonly known as the rough lycianthes, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries contain seeds that are dispersed by animals, contributing to the plant's natural distribution. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
