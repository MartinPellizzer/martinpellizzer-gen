    "intro": "Liparis rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on cliffs or slopes. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It has a short, upright stem with few leaves, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich environment. Liparis rupestris is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
