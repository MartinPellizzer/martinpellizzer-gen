    "intro": "Lathyrus rollandii, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, twining stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds enclosed in pods, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Lathyrus rollandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
