    "intro": "Lecanopteris incurvata, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, curling fronds that often remain tightly coiled even when mature. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a velvety texture, with a distinctive, recurved shape that gives it its common name. Lecanopteris incurvata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in humid environments."
