    "intro": "Linaria biebersteinii subsp. strictissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
