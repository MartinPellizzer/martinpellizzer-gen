    "intro": "Lepisorus lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, which gives the plant its common name. It is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with temperate climates and high humidity. This fern is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
