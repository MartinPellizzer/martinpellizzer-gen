    "intro": "Lepistemon intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate lepistemon, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
