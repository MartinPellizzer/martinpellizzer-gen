    "intro": "Lactuca visianii, commonly known as the wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains lactucin and other lactucosides, which are compounds responsible for its mild sedative effects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its latex sap has been historically used in traditional medicine for its calming properties."
