It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Leptalea apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
