    "intro": "Liparis nervosa f. kappleri, commonly known as the Kappler's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and intricate floral structure. It features a tall, slender stem bearing a dense spike of small, white to pale pink flowers, arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Alps, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
