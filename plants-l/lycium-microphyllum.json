    "intro": "Lycium microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally avoided by humans due to their tart flavor. Lycium microphyllum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along disturbed areas. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions."
