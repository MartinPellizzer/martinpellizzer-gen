    "intro": "Lupinus tetracercophorus, commonly known as the four-circled lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clustered, spiny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Lupinus tetracercophorus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
