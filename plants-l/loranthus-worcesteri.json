    "intro": "Loranthus worcesteri, commonly known as the Worcester\u2019s mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China. The plant produces small, green leaves and white or yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
