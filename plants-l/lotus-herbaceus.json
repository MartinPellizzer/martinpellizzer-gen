    "intro": "Lotus herbaceus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
