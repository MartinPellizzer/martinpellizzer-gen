It is characterized by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the standard variety. The plant produces slender, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is primarily cultivated for its fibers, which are used in textile production, as well as for its oil-rich seeds."
