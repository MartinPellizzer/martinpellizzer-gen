    "intro": "Lomaria opaca, commonly known as the common lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, upright stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, round, brown seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Lomaria opaca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
