    "intro": "Lyonsia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lyonsia, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Lyonsia oblongifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and forests."
