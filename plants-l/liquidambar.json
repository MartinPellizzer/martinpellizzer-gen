    "intro": "Liquidambar, commonly known as sweet gum, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Aceraceae family. It is native to eastern North America and parts of China, and it is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The tree produces clusters of spiky, spherical fruit that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a flaky texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures. Liquidambar is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant fall foliage and unique seed capsules."
