It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, usually hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are usually triangular in shape, hence the common name, and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lactuca triquetra is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Lactuca."
