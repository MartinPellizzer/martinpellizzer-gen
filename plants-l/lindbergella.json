    "intro": "Lindbergella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender roots and pale, almost translucent leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Lindbergella is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
