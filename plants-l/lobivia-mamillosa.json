    "intro": "Lobivia mamillosa, commonly known as the Woolly Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant typically has a short, thick stem with clusters of small, rounded tubercles. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Lobivia mamillosa is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
