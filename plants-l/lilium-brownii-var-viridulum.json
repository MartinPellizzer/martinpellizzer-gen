It is characterized by its striking, elongated, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, often reflexed petals that are adorned with intricate patterns, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
