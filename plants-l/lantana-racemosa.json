    "intro": "Lantana racemosa, commonly known as wild lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal areas or disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Lantana racemosa is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
