    "intro": "Lilium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt lily, is a striking perennial herb native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, showy white or pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces recurved, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude habitat. This species is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with adequate drainage and cool climates."
