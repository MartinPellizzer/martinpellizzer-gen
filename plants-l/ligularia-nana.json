    "intro": "Ligularia nana, commonly known as dwarf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is a popular choice for shaded garden beds."
