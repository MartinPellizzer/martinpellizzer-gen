It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lamarchea sulcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
