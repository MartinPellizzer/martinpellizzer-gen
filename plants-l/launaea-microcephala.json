    "intro": "Launaea microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and latex-producing tissues. The plant has a short, thick stem with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Launaea microcephala is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions."
