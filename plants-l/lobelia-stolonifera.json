    "intro": "Lobelia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its foliage consists of opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia stolonifera thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and woodland areas."
