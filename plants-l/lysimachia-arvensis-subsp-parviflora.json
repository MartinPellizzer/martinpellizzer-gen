    "intro": "Lysimachia arvensis subsp. parviflora, commonly known as narrowleaf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in cultivated areas."
