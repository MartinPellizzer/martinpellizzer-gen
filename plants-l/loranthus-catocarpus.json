    "intro": "Loranthus catocarpus, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited foliage it possesses. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects, leading to the development of red, fleshy berries. These berries contain seeds that are dispersed by birds, which consume the fruit and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees. Loranthus catocarpus plays an important ecological role in tropical ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
