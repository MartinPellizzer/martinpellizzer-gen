    "intro": "Leptomischus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant's roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it also photosynthesizes to some extent. Leptomischus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions. Its presence can have both ecological and economic impacts on the host trees it attaches to."
