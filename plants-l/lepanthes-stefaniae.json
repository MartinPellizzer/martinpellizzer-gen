    "intro": "Lepanthes stefaniae, commonly known as the Stefania's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as pink, white, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly ornamental, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Lepanthes stefaniae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
