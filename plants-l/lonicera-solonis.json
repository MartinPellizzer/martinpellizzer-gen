    "intro": "Lonicera solonis, commonly known as the European honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Lonicera solonis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
