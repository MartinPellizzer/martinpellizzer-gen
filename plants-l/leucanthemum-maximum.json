    "intro": "Leucanthemum maximum, commonly known as the ox-eye daisy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white ray flowers surrounding a yellow central disk, which gives it a daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces showy flowers from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and grasslands. Leucanthemum maximum is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
