It is characterized by its hairy, rugose leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
