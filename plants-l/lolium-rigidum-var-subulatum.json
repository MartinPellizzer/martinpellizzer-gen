    "intro": "Lolium rigidum var. subulatum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is often used in pastureland and for erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
