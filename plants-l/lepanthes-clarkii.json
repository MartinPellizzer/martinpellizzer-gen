    "intro": "Lepanthes clarkii, commonly known as Clark's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes clarkii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations."
