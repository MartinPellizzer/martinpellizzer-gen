    "intro": "Lonicera \u00d7 bella var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, rose-pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
