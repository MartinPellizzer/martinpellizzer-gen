    "intro": "Luxemburgia major, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its large, crust-like thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in diameter. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
