    "intro": "Lithocardium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
