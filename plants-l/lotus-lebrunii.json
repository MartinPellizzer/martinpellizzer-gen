    "intro": "Lotus lebrunii, commonly known as the African lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Africa. It features striking, large, water-lily-like flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinct central spadix. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lotus lebrunii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
