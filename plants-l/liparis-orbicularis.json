    "intro": "Liparis orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Liparis orbicularis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
