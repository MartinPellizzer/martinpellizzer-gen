    "intro": "Leymus tianschanicus var. borealis, commonly known as the northern feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and subarctic regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
