It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife. Lonicera kabylica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
