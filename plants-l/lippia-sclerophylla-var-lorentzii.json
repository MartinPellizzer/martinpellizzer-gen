It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in dry, warm climates. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
