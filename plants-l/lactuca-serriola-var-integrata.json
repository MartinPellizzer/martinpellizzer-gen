    "intro": "Lactuca serriola var. integrata, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its lobed leaves with serrated edges and a hairy texture, which give it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can compete with agricultural crops and is sometimes considered a weed."
