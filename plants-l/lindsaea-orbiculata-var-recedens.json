    "intro": "Lindsaea orbiculata var. recedens, commonly known as the broad-leafed tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features intricate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, aiding in moisture retention. Its rhizomes are short and often form a compact rosette, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or branches. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
