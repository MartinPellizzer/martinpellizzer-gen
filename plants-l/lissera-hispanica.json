    "intro": "Lissera hispanica, commonly known as Spanish speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Lissera hispanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
