    "intro": "Leptodermis huashanica, commonly known as the Huashan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, where it forms dense clusters of foliage. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
