    "intro": "Loranthus knoblercheri, commonly known as the knoblercher's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to certain regions of Africa and is often found in specific forest ecosystems."
