    "intro": "Lactuca taliiensis, commonly known as the Talis mountain lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in the Talysh Mountains of Iran and Azerbaijan. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the dandelion family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lactuca taliiensis is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species."
