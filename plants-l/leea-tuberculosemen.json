It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes due to its limited growth habit and specific environmental requirements."
