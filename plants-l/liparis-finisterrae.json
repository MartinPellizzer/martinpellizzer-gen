    "intro": "Liparis finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroese orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Streymoy in the Faroe Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow hue and a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
