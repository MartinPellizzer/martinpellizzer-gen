    "intro": "Lupinus macrostachys var. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for native plant gardens and restoration projects. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
