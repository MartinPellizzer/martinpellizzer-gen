    "intro": "Linguella nana, commonly known as the dwarf linguella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
