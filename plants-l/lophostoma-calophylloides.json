    "intro": "Lophostoma calophylloides, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its foliage is often broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually pink or white and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
