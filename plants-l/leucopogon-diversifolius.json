    "intro": "Leucopogon diversifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved heath, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to south-eastern Australia, where it typically grows in heathlands and dry forests. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Leucopogon diversifolius is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate."
