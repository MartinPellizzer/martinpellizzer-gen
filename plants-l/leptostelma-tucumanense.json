    "intro": "Leptostelma tucumanense, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of Argentina and Peru. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, star-shaped flowers, which are usually white or pale green. Leptostelma tucumanense is noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to alpine ecosystems."
