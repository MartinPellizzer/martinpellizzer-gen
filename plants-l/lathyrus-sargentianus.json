    "intro": "Lathyrus sargentianus, commonly known as Sargent's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, ascending stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
