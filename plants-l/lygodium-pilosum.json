    "intro": "Lygodium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical climbing fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its unique morphology includes small, hairy stipules at the base of the fronds. Lygodium pilosum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
