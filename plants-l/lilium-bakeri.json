    "intro": "Lilium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and even red. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing delicate, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium bakeri is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
