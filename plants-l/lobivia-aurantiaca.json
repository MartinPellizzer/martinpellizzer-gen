    "intro": "Lobivia aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Ghost cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lobivia aurantiaca is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
