    "intro": "Lithops aucampiae, commonly known as the \"Faux Bells,\" is a member of the Aizoaceae family and is native to South Africa. This succulent plant is characterized by its pair of fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble small stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Lithops aucampiae is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
