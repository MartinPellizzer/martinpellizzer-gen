    "intro": "Lobelia siphilitica, commonly known as great blue lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking cobalt-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, rich soils. It is often found in woodlands and wetlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity. Its common name reflects its historical association with syphilis, though this connection is more cultural than botanical."
