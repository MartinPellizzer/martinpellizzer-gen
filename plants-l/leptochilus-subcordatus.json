    "intro": "Leptochilus subcordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thyme, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina, this species thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats due to its low-growing habit. Its foliage is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other members of the mint family."
