    "intro": "Leymus \u00d7 multiflorus, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability and resilience, Leymus \u00d7 multiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
