    "intro": "Linnaea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf twinflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to spatulate leaves and clusters of small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. Linnaea spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
