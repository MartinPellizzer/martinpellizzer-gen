    "intro": "Lotus macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the surface. Lotus macrocarpus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
