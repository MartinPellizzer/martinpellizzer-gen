    "intro": "Lastrea vilis, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
