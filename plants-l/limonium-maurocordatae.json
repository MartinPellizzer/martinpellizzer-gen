    "intro": "Limonium maurocordatae, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. Limonium maurocordatae is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
