    "intro": "Lotus dichotomus, commonly known as the dichotomous lotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-branched inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom during the summer months and attract various pollinators."
