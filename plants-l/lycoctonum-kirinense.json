    "intro": "Lycoctonum kirinense, commonly known as the Kirin Mountain bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
