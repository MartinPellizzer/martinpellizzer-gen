    "intro": "Lygodium venustum var. granatense, commonly known as the Granate Brake, is a fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
