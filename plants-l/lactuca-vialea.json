    "intro": "Lactuca vialea, commonly known as the lesser lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a bitter taste due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Lactuca vialea is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
