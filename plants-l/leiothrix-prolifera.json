    "intro": "Leiothrix prolifera, commonly known as the creeping spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as an ornamental plant in gardens."
