    "intro": "Lomatopodium, commonly known as the goatweed or lomatium, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their hairy, often branched stems and clusters of small, yellow or white flowers. The leaves are typically lobed or toothed, and the plant often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Lomatopodium species are known for their aromatic foliage and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native environments."
