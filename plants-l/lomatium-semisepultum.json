    "intro": "Lomatium semisepultum, commonly known as the western lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. Native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, loment-shaped seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The plant's unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
