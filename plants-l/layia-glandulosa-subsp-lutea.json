It is characterized by its yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense yellow flower color compared to other members of the species."
