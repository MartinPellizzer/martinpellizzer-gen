It is a perennial grass that typically grows in low vegetation communities on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Lilaeopsis gunnii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
