    "intro": "Leucojum trichophyllum f. broteroi, commonly known as the Broter's white squill, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the white squill species. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in woodland and scrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
