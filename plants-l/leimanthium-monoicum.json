It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its distinctive single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
