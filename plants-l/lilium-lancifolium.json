    "intro": "Lilium lancifolium, commonly known as the tiger lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves and striking orange to red flowers with dark veins. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are composed of six tepals and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
