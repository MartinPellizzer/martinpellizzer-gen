    "intro": "Lepidium cartilagineum var. descemetii, commonly known as the desert pepper or rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, edible seeds that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
