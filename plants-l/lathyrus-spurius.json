    "intro": "Lathyrus spurius, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Lathyrus spurius is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
