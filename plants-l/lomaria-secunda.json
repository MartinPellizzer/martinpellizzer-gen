    "intro": "Lomaria secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf structures. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow flowers. Lomaria secunda is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
