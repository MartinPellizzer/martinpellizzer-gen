    "intro": "Lycopodium poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces sporophylls. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate sporophylls, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
