    "intro": "Lupinus seclusus, commonly known as the hidden lupine, is a rare and elusive member of the legume family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and feathery leaves, typical of many lupine species. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique morphology includes a taproot system that allows it to access deep soil moisture. Lupinus seclusus plays a vital role in soil enrichment through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
