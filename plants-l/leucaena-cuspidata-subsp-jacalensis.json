    "intro": "Leucaena cuspidata subsp. jacalensis, commonly known as Jacalense leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for reforestation and soil stabilization efforts. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
