It is a compact annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is characterized by its reflexed (bent backward) petals, which give it a unique floral morphology. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
