    "intro": "Limodorum lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's lily, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single, showy inflorescence that consists of several hooded flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
