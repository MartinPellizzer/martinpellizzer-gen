    "intro": "Limeum pterocarpum var. apterum, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and compound leaves. The plant has small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
