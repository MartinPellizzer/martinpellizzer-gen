    "intro": "Lycopodioides cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with spiral arrangements of scale-like leaves. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
