    "intro": "Lepanthopsis paryskii, commonly known as the Paryskii's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves, which help it store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
