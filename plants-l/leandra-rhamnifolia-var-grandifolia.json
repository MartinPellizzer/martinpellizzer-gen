    "intro": "Leandra rhamnifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant leandra, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stem and evergreen foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
