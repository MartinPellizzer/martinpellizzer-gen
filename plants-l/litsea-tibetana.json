    "intro": "Litsea tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan litsea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions in Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocados, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a subtle citrus-like scent when crushed. Litsea tibetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
