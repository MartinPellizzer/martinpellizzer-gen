    "intro": "Lambertia orbifolia, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or yellow hakea, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, orb-shaped yellow flowers that appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are leathery and alternate, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Lambertia orbifolia is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun."
