    "intro": "Lobelia laxiflora f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-flowered lobelia, is a variant of the slender lobelia native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
