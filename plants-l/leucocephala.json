    "intro": "Leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed tree or white-headed bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. They produce small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Leucocephala species are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen, making them useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
