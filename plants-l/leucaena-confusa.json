    "intro": "Leucaena confusa, commonly known as the white leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties, allowing it to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Leucaena confusa is also valued for its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
