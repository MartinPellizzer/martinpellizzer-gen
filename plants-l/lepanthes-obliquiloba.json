It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique floral structure characterized by its elongated, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Lepanthes obliquiloba is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
