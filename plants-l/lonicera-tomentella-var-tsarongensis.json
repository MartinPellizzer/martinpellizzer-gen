    "intro": "Lonicera tomentella var. tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
