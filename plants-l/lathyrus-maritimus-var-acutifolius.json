    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus var. acutifolius, commonly known as the sharp-leaved field bean, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with sharply pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in coastal ecosystems."
