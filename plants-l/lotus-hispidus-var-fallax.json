    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. fallax, commonly known as the hairy lotus or fallax lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features palmate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
