    "intro": "Lapeirousia manuleiflora, commonly known as the Kleinmann's rain lily, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that die back after flowering, allowing the bulb to store energy for the next blooming season. Native to the Western Cape province, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
