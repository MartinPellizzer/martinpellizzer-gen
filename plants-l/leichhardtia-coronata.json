    "intro": "Leichhardtia coronata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect stem that bears the unique floral structure. Leichhardtia coronata is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
