    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus serratifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, cherry-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant. However, its fruits and leaves are toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation."
