    "intro": "Limonium mareoticum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in salty environments. Limonium mareoticum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
