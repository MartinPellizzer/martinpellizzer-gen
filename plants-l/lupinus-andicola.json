    "intro": "Lupinus andicola, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus andicola is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often found in alpine and grassland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
