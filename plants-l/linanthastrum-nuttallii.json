    "intro": "Linanthastrum nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's linanthastrum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are usually clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Linanthastrum nuttallii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
