    "intro": "Listera brevidens, commonly known as the short-leaved twayblade, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant has a slender, erect stem with two opposite leaves, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Listera brevidens typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
