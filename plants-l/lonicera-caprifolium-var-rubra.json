    "intro": "Lonicera caprifolium var. rubra, commonly known as red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, depending on the variety. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The red honeysuckle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types once established."
