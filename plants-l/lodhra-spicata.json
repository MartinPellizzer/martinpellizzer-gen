It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often fragrant leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, greenish-black berries that mature in the autumn. Lodhra spicata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
