    "intro": "Linaria pedunculata var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers resembling those of snapdragons. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is often cultivated with caution."
