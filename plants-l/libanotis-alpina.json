    "intro": "Libanotis alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Libanotis alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats."
