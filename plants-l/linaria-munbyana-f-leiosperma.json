    "intro": "Linaria munbyana f. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-flowered toadflax, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, silky hair that gives the plant its \"leiosperma\" designation, meaning \"smooth seed-bearing.\" This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its delicate, cascading blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a bedding plant."
