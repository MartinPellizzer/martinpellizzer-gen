    "intro": "Leontodon saxatilis subsp. taraxacoides, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone soils and rocky outcrops. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, upright stem topped with a yellow composite flower head. Its flowers are composed of many tiny ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. The species is characterized by its robust, often hairy stems and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
