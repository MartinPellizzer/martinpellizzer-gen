    "intro": "Lycopodium duidae, commonly known as the Duidae clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
