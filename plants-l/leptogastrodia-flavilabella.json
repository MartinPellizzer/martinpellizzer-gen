    "intro": "Leptogastrodia flavilabella, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate roots that help it anchor in its habitat. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and adequate sunlight."
