    "intro": "Lasiandra hieracioides var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in winter, typically from June to August, and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in a reddish or rusty-colored bloom, giving the plant its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and provides nectar for native pollinators."
