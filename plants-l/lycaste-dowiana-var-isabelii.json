    "intro": "Lycaste dowiana var. isabelii, commonly known as Isabel's lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with yellow and green markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated, dark green, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires careful watering to prevent root rot."
