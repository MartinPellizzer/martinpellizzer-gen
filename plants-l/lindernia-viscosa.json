    "intro": "Lindernia viscosa, commonly known as sticky lindernia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has hairy, sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
