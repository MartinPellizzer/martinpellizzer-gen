    "intro": "Luziola, commonly known as the nightshade or moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are characterized by their showy, often nocturnal blooms that open in the evening and close at dawn. Luziola species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in woodland or shaded areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
