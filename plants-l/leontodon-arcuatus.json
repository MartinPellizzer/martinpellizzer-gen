    "intro": "Leontodon arcuatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or bentleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often slightly bent, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family."
