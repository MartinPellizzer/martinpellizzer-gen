    "intro": "Lepisanthes virdis, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators like bees and wasps. Lepisanthes virdis is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
