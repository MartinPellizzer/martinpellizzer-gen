    "intro": "Leucadendron imbricatum, commonly known as the silver leaf candle bush, is a striking South African shrub characterized by its silvery-white, papery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is native to the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in cone-like inflorescences, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a favored plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
