    "intro": "Lithocardium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
