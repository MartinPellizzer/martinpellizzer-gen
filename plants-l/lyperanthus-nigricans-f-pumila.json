    "intro": "Lyperanthus nigricans f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf black-flowered ironweed, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique floral coloration and compact growth make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens."
