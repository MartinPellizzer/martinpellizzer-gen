    "intro": "Lessingia micradenia var. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-hairless cushion flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive, glandular appearance. This variety is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many plants adapted to dry conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
