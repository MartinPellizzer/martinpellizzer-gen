    "intro": "Leptagrostis, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, grass-like leaves. Leptagrostis species often produce panicles of tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
