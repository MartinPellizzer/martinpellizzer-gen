It is a succulent cactus characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and rockeries."
