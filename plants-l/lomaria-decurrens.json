    "intro": "Lomaria decurrens, commonly known as the spreading lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Lomaria decurrens is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
