    "intro": "Linochilus santamartae, commonly known as the Santamara orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude grasslands of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
