    "intro": "Linanthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically annuals or short-lived perennials, characterized by their erect stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. Linanthus species are adapted to arid environments, featuring small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. They produce capsule fruits that release seeds when disturbed, aiding in their dispersal. The genus is part of the evening primrose family, known for its ecological importance to pollinators like bees and moths."
