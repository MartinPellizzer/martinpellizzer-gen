    "intro": "Listrostachys pescatoriana, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, often growing along shores and in mangrove swamps. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in sandy soils."
