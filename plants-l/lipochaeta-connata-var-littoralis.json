    "intro": "Lipochaeta connata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lipochaeta, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
