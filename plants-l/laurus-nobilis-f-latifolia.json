    "intro": "Laurus nobilis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved laurel, is a cultivar of the sweet bay laurel. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical laurel, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, shrub-like growth habit that makes it suitable for ornamental use. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun. The leaves are often used in cooking, similar to the standard laurel, and can also be used in aromatic applications."
