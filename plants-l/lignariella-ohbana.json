    "intro": "Lignariella ohbana, commonly known as the Japanese lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is a symbiotic lichen formed by a fungal partner and a green alga, which together thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, often found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces. Its structure is characterized by a dense, leathery thallus that can vary in color from yellowish to dark brown. Lignariella ohbana plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
