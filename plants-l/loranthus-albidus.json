    "intro": "Loranthus albidus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its life cycle involves the dispersal of its seeds by birds, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees. Loranthus albidus plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native Australian habitats."
