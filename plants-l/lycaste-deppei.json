    "intro": "Lycaste deppei, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming orchid, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a velvety texture and a strong, sweet scent. Lycaste deppei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
