    "intro": "Lastrea ochthodes, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
