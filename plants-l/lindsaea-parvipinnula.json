The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually short and narrow, with a soft, velvety texture. Lindsaea parvipinnula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
