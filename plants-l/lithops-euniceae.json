    "intro": "Lithops euniceae, commonly known as the \"Fog Catcher Lithops,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its two fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble stones, which help it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season. Lithops euniceae is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
