    "intro": "Luzula althii, commonly known as the alpine woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are grass-like, forming dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Luzula althii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
