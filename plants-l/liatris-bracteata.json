    "intro": "Liatris bracteata, commonly known as the narrowleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its tall, slender stems bear clusters of purple to pink bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Liatris bracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
