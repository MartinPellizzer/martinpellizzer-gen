    "intro": "Lobelia heterophylla f. major-atroviolacea, commonly known as the purple-leaved lobelia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that range from deep purple to reddish hues, providing a bold visual contrast to its small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in partial shade. The species is also valued for its ecological role, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich blooms."
