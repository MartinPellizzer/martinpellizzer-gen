    "intro": "Leschenaultia biloba, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with silver-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Leschenaultia biloba is adapted to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
