    "intro": "Limosella minuta, commonly known as the minute sandspurry, is a small annual flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. The plant has tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, and it produces small, rounded fruits. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is often overlooked due to its diminutive size. Limosella minuta is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
