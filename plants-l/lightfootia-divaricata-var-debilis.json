It features thin, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
