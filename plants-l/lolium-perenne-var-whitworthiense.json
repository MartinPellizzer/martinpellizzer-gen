It is a cool-season grass characterized by its dense growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. This plant is typically found in grassland ecosystems and is adapted to temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in landscaping and forage production."
