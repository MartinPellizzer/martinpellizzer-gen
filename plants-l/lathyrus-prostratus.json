    "intro": "Lathyrus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate pea, is a low-growing annual legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which are typically borne in clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus prostratus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
