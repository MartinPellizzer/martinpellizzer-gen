    "intro": "Lygodium gracilescens, commonly known as the slender climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, climbing structure. The plant typically grows along forest floors or on tree trunks, utilizing its rhizomes to spread horizontally. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lygodium gracilescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
