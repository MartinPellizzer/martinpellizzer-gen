    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender twinflower, is a rare and delicate variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two. The plant has creeping stems that form a dense mat, and its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This form is distinguished by its more slender growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
