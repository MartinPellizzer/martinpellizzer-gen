    "intro": "Leptodactylon, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Leptodactylon species produce small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, and their fruits are dry, capsule-like structures. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
