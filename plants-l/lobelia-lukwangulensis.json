    "intro": "Lobelia lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwangulu lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
