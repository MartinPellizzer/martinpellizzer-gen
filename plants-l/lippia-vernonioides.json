    "intro": "Lippia vernonioides, commonly known as Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, mint-scented leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lippia vernonioides is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its medicinal properties require further scientific validation."
