    "intro": "Lepechinia salviifolia, commonly known as bluebunch needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Lepechinia salviifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
