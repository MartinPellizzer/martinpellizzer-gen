    "intro": "Lathyrus macrorrhizus var. varifolius, commonly known as the variable-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with variable leaflet shapes, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
