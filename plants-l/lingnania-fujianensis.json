    "intro": "Lingnania fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian lingnania, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Fujian Province in China. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring season, followed by distinctive, woody capsules as its fruit. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
