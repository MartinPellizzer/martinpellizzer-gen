    "intro": "Loranthus copelandii, commonly known as the copeland's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can significantly impact the host tree's health if left unchecked. Its small, white or pink flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees are present."
