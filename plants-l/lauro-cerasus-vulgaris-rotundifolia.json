It features dark green, glossy leaves that are oval and slightly wavy in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, cherry-like berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is tolerant of various soil types. However, its berries are toxic to humans and animals, requiring caution in gardens."
