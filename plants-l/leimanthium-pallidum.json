    "intro": "Leimanthium pallidum, commonly known as the pale leimanthium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
