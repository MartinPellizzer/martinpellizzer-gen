    "intro": "Lithocardium macrocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithocardium macrocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
