    "intro": "Leptocarpus secundus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and estuaries. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to retain water in salty conditions. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by wind, while its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds via water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
