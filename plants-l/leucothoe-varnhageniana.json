    "intro": "Leucothoe varnhageniana, commonly known as the Appalachian leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and it produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Leucothoe varnhageniana is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its low maintenance requirements."
