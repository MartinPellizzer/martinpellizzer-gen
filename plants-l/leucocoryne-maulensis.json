    "intro": "Leucocoryne maulensis, commonly known as the Maulens Mountain lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
