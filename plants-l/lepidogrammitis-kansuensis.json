    "intro": "Lepidogrammitis kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Lepidogrammitis kansuensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
