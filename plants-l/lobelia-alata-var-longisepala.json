    "intro": "Lobelia alata var. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled cardinal flower, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular red or orange flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variant is distinguished by its elongated sepals, which give it its scientific name and enhance its ornamental appeal."
