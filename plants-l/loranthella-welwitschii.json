    "intro": "Loranthella welwitschii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the savanna regions of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through partial photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting wildlife."
