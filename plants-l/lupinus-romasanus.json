    "intro": "Lupinus romasanus, commonly known as the Romasian lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus romasanus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Its seeds are often used in traditional agriculture for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
