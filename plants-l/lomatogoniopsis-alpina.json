It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lomatogoniopsis alpina is known for its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months."
