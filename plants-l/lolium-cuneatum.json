    "intro": "Lolium cuneatum, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence, which contains small, two-lobed flowers. The plant is widely cultivated for forage due to its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in pastureland and erosion control. Lolium cuneatum is also an important weed in agricultural fields, particularly in cereals."
