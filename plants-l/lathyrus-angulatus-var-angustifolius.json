    "intro": "Lathyrus angulatus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, elongated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
