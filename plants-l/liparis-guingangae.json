It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis guingangae is considered a vulnerable species."
