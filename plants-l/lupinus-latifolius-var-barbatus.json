    "intro": "Lupinus latifolius var. barbatus, commonly known as the broadleaf lupine with barbed pods, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its distinctive barbed pods are a key identifying feature, and the plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. Lupinus latifolius var. barbatus is also an important species for soil nitrogen fixation and is used in restoration ecology."
