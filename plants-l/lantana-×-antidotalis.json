    "intro": "Lantana \u00d7 antidotalis, commonly known as the orange lantana, is a hybrid shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
