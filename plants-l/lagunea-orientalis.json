    "intro": "Lagunea orientalis, commonly known as the oriental marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Lagunea orientalis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
