    "intro": "Lotus laricus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Lotus laricus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its symbolic significance in various cultures is closely tied to its botanical features and life cycle."
