    "intro": "Lindernia racemosa, commonly known as the whorled lindernia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds via wind. Lindernia racemosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
