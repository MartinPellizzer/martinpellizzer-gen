It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes."
