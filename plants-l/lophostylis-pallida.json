    "intro": "Lophostylis pallida, commonly known as the slender lophostylis, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, shrub-like species with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, elongated capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lophostylis pallida is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
