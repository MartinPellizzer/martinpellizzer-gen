    "intro": "Lindera foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ligustrum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive yellowish or whitish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade. Lindera foveolata is also noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
