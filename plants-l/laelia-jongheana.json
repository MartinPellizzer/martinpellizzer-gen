    "intro": "Laelia jongheana, commonly known as the Jonghean orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental value. Laelia jongheana is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its hardiness and ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
