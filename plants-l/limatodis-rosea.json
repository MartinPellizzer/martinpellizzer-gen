It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant blooms that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.
