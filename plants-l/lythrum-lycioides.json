It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its striking red stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are reddish in color, giving the plant its common name. Lythrum lycioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
