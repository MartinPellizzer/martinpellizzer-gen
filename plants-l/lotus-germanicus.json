    "intro": "Lotus germanicus, commonly known as the German water-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a showy structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The roots of Lotus germanicus can form dense mats, which can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems."
