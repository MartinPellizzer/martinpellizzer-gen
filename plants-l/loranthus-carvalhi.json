    "intro": "Loranthus carvalhi, commonly known as the Portuguese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This parasitic relationship can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
