    "intro": "Leucheria gossypina var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its fibrous bark and woody stems make it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often found in riparian zones and can tolerate periodic flooding."
