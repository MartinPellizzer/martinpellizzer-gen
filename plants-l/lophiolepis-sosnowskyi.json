It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 1 meter in length. Lophiolepis sosnowskyi is known for its toxic sap, which contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin reactions upon exposure to sunlight."
