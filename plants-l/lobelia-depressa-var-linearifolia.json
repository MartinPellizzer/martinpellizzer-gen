    "intro": "Lobelia depressa var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lobelia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its flowers are typically clustered in spikes, and the plant is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. The narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Lobeliaceae family."
