    "intro": "Lactuca deggeleriana, commonly known as Deggeler's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by small, dry seeds. Lactuca deggeleriana is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
