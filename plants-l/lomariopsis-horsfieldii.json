    "intro": "Lomariopsis horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to New Zealand, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its intricate frond structure and unique reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
