It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces two-seeded berries that are typically reddish in color, which are an important food source for various bird species. Lithospermum dispermum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
