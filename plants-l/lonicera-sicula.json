    "intro": "Lonicera sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Lonicera sicula is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
