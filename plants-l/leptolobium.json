These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Leptolobium species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. They often grow in rocky or alpine habitats, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
