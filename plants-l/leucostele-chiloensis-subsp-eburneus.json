    "intro": "Leucostele chiloensis subsp. eburneus, commonly known as the silver-leaved leucostele, is a species native to southern South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of South American flora."
