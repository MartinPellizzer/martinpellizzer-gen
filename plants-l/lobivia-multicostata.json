    "intro": "Lobivia multicostata, commonly known as the multibract euphorbia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem with prominent, ribbed structures that help it store water. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
