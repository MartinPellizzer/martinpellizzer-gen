    "intro": "Lindsaea chienii var. recedens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, hanging clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This varietal form is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical variety of Lindsaea chienii."
