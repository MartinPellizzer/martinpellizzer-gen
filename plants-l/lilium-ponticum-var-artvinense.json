    "intro": "Lilium ponticum var. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinct red throat, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are long and linear, forming a basal rosette, while its stem is sturdy and erect. This variety is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
