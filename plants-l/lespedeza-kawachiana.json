    "intro": "Lespedeza kawachiana, commonly known as Chinese straggler's bowstring, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Lespedeza kawachiana is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
