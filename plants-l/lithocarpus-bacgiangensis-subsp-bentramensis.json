    "intro": "Lithocarpus bacgiangensis subsp. bentramensis, commonly known as the Benthram's stone\u680e, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, woody fruit and evergreen leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in Vietnam and possibly parts of Laos. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and have a prominent midrib, while the fruit is a one-seeded nut enclosed in a thick, woody husk. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in tropical rainforests."
