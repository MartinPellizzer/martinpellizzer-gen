    "intro": "Lafoensia vandelliana subsp. vandelliana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its rapid growth rate. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pink in color. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
