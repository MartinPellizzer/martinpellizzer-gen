    "intro": "Lessingianthus petraeus, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounded by orange-brown disk florets, creating a striking floral display. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Lessingianthus petraeus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
