    "intro": "Lysimachia decurrens var. recurvata, commonly known as the curly willow herb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing perennial that typically features slender, creeping stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
