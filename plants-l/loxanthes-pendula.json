It is characterized by its drooping clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has aromatic leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Loxanthes pendula is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
