    "intro": "Lupinus austrorientalis var. umidicola, commonly known as the wetland lupin, is a flowering plant native to moist environments in eastern Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, riverbanks, and swampy areas, thriving in waterlogged soils. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces tall spikes of bright yellow to orange flowers. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
