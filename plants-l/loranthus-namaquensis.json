    "intro": "Loranthus namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily proteas, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. The plant lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and nutrients. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees."
