    "intro": "Leucosyke arcuatovenosa, commonly known as the wavy-veined milkweed, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, wavy-veined leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature. Leucosyke arcuatovenosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ecological importance for certain insect species."
