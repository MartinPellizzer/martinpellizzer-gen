    "intro": "Linum dehiscens, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to bright red, often changing with the weather. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
