    "intro": "Lomandra teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact, low-growing rosette. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers, typically blooming in spring. Lomandra teres is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its natural habitat includes coastal and inland regions, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
