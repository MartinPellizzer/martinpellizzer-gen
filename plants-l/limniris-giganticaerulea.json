    "intro": "Limniris giganticaerulea, commonly known as the Azure Giant Water Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its enormous, bluish-purple floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant's flowers, which bloom at night, are pale blue and emit a subtle fragrance attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots anchor it in shallow waters, while its broad leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. Due to its size and beauty, it is a prized species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
