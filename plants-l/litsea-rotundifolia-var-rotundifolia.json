    "intro": "Litsea rotundifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread aggressively."
