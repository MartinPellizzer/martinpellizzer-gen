    "intro": "Leptospermum parviflorum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Leptospermum parviflorum is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
