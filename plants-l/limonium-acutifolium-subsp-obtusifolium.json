    "intro": "Limonium acutifolium subsp. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces spikes of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are broad and rounded, distinguishing it from other Limonium species. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
