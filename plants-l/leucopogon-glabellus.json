    "intro": "Leucopogon glabellus, commonly known as the smooth leucopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family (Ericaceae). It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetlands and swampy areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Leucopogon glabellus is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and birds."
