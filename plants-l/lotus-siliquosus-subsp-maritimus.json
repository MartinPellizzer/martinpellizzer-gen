    "intro": "Lotus siliquosus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the maritime lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant features slender, floating stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and bloom in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
