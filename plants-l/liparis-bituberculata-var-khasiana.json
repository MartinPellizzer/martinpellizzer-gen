    "intro": "Liparis bituberculata var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces dense, dark green foliage. The plant bears small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, mat-like inflorescence, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
