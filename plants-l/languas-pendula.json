    "intro": "Languas pendula, commonly known as the hanging bells, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its pendant, tubular flowers that resemble small bells, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
