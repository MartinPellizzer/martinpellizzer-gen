    "intro": "Luffa hilapikku, commonly known as the sponge gourd or loofah, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy fruit that matures into a rough, net-like texture. The plant produces yellow flowers and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its growth habit involves trailing or climbing stems that require support for optimal development. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature to ensure the best texture and usability."
