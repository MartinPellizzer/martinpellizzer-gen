    "intro": "Lepanthes trullifera, commonly known as the \"Coral Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that often display a striking coral-pink or white coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree bark rather than growing in soil. Lepanthes trullifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
