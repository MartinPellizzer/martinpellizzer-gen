    "intro": "Lycopodium schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures called strobili. Native to the high altitudes of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Lycopodium schlimii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
