    "intro": "Lemna aoukikusa, commonly known as Japanese duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the Lemnaceae family. It has tiny, heart-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and it reproduces rapidly through budding. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its simple structure and high reproductive rate make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from water."
