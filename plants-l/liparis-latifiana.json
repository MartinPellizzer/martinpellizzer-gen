    "intro": "Liparis latifiana, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Liparis latifiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
