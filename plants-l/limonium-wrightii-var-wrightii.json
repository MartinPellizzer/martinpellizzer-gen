    "intro": "Limonium wrightii var. wrightii, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered along the stems. Limonium wrightii var. wrightii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
