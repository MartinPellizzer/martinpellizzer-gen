    "intro": "Lobelia comosa, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Lobelia comosa is valued in native gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
