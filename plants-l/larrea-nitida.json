It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Larrea nitida is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal remedies."
