    "intro": "Lactuca hastata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular lettuce, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in small, sticky structures. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a slightly bitter taste. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
