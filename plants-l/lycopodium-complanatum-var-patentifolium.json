    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. patentifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This variety is notable for its distinctive broad, flat leaves that set it apart from other clubmoss species."
