    "intro": "Leiocarpa leptolepis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed coralroot, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the orchid family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a hemiparasitic species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within forests."
