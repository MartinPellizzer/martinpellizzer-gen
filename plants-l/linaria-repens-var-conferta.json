    "intro": "Linaria repens var. conferta, commonly known as the dense carpet flower, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often covering the ground in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy and decorative appearance."
