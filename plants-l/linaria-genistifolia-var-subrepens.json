    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia var. subrepens, commonly known as creeping flaxflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
