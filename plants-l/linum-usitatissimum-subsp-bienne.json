It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and it is well-known for its fibrous seed coat, which is used in the production of linen. Its seeds are also valued for their oil content, which is used in food and industrial applications. The subspecies bienne is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more common L. usitatissimum."
