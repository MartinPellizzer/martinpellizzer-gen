    "intro": "Loranthus cycnei-sinus, commonly known as the Sinus cycnei Loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and usually clustered, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same inflorescence. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, facilitating its dispersal by animals."
