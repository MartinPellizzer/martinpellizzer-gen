    "intro": "Leymus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as steppes, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Leymus sibiricus is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
