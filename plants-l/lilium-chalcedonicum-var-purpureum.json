    "intro": "Lilium chalcedonicum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-fleshed lily, is a rare and ornamental variant of the chalcedonic lily. It is characterized by its striking, deep purple to almost black bulb and its showy, fragrant white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing trumpet-shaped petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, preferring cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
