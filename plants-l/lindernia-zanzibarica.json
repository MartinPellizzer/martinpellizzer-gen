It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to attract pollinators."
