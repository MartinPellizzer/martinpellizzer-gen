    "intro": "Lesemia, commonly known as the white clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Lesemia species are typically found in temperate regions and are often used in forage and soil enrichment due to their nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground. It is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and conditions."
