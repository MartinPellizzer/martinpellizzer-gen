    "intro": "Lychnis viscosa, commonly known as sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Lychnis viscosa is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
