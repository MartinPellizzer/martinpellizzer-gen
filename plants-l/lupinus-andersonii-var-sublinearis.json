    "intro": "Lupinus andersonii var. sublinearis, commonly known as the Anderson's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which benefit the soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
