    "intro": "Lotus emeroides, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often floating on the surface of still waters. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that repels water. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water. The lotus is renowned for its symbolic significance in various cultures and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, still water environments."
