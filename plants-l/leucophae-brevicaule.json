    "intro": "Leucophae brevicaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed white-leaved plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
