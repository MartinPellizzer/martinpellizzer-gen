    "intro": "Lupinus jahnii, commonly known as the Jahn's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. Lupinus jahnii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
