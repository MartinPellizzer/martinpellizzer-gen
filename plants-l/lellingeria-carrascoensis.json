It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
