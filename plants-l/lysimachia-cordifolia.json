    "intro": "Lysimachia cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf chickweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lysimachia cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
