    "intro": "Lissochilus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and strikingly colorful, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
