    "intro": "Leiothamnus, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are shrubs characterized by their compact growth habit and evergreen leaves. They typically thrive in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Leiothamnus species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer."
