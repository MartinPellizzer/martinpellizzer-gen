    "intro": "Lycopodium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed clubmoss, is a small evergreen perennial plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in North America, it thrives in rocky or forested areas. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems highlight its significance in both botanical and ecological contexts."
