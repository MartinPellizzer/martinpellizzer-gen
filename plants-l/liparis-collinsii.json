    "intro": "Liparis collinsii, commonly known as Collins' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers rich, well-drained soil. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its growth habit is rhizomatous. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some areas and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
