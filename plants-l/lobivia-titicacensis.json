    "intro": "Lobivia titicacensis, commonly known as the Titiacan Lobivia, is a succulent native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, barrel-shaped stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
