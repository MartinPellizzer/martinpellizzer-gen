    "intro": "Lepanthes conchilabia, commonly known as the shell-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a unique combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Lepanthes conchilabia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
