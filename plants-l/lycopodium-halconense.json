    "intro": "Lycopodium halconense, commonly known as the Halcon clubmoss, is a rare and unique species of lycophyte native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of its branches, and it plays a minor role in its local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
