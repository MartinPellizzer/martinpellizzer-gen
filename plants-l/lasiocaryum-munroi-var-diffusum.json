    "intro": "Lasiocaryum munroi var. diffusum, commonly known as the hairy leathery fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to any botanical collection. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
