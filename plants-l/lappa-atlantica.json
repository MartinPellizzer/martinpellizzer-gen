    "intro": "Lappa atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are hollow and covered in fine hairs, and it has a strong, unpleasant odor. Lappa atlantica is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the sea coast."
