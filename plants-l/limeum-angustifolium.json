    "intro": "Limeum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
