    "intro": "Lepidophyllum rupestre, commonly known as the rock rose or desert rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a characteristic common in many succulents. Lepidophyllum rupestre is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
