    "intro": "Leptoglottis leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
