    "intro": "Leptoglottis palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and resilient plant in its habitat."
