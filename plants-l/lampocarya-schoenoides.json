    "intro": "Lampocarya schoenoides, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, woolly leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are followed by elongated, bract-like structures that enclose the seed capsules."
