    "intro": "Lygodium colaniae, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along riverbanks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Lygodium colaniae plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
