    "intro": "Ledum palustre subsp. diversipilosum, commonly known as the hairy laburnum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and wet heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
