    "intro": "Linaria lamarckii, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that resemble small toads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Linaria lamarckii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
