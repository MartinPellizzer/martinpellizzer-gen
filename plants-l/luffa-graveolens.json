    "intro": "Luffa graveolens, commonly known as the sponge gourd, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, hairy leaves and elongated, fibrous fruits that mature into spongy structures. The plant produces yellow flowers and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its fibrous inner layer, known as luffa, is harvested when fully mature for use as a natural exfoliant. Luffa graveolens is also valued for its edible young fruits and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
