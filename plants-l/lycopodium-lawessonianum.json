    "intro": "Lycopodium lawessonianum, commonly known as the Philippine clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium lawessonianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
