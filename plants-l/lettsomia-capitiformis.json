    "intro": "Lettsomia capitiformis, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a single, showy head, giving it its species name \"capitiformis,\" meaning \"head-shaped.\" It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost resistance and ability to bloom throughout the year in mild climates."
