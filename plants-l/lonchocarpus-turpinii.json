    "intro": "Lonchocarpus turpinii, commonly known as the turpentine acacia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and a distinctive root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
