    "intro": "Loranthus blumeanus, commonly known as the Blume's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating propagation. Loranthus blumeanus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
