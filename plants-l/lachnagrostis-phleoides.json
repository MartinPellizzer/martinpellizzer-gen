    "intro": "Lachnagrostis phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Lachnagrostis phleoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
