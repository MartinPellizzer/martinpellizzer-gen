    "intro": "Leontodon nigricans, commonly known as the black leontodon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flower heads that develop into brown, spiky seed heads, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Leontodon nigricans is often found in disturbed areas and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
