    "intro": "Lycopodium imbricatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium imbricatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
