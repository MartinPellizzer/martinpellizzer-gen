    "intro": "Laportea vitifolia, commonly known as sweetroot, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves that emit a sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Laportea vitifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
