    "intro": "Lastrea schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's lastrea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
