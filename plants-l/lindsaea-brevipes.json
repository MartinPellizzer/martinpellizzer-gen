    "intro": "Lindsaea brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features short, sturdy stems with dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, known as spore-bearing capsules, are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lindsaea brevipes thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
