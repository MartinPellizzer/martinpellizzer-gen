    "intro": "Loxanthocereus cullmannianus, commonly known as the Cullmann's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow to orange. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
