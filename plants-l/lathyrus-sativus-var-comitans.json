    "intro": "Lathyrus sativus var. comitans, commonly known as the edible vetch or climbing vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender stems that often twine around supports. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional agriculture."
