It is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and dense, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
