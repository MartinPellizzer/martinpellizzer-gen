    "intro": "Lamourouxia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered lamourouxia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and compound leaves with a pinnate structure, often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
