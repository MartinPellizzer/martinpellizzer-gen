It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its grayish, fuzzy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Lithocnide lappulacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
