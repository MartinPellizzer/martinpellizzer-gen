    "intro": "Lycopodioides vaginata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, perennial herb that thrives in moist, sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with small, scale-like leaves that give it a velvety appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores. Lycopodioides vaginata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an indicator species for certain coastal ecosystems."
