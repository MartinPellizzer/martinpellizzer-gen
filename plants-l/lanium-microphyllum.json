    "intro": "Lanium microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Lanium microphyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
