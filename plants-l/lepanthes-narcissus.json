It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which often have a subtle green or white lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Lepanthes narcissus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
