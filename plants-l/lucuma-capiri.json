It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, yellow-orange fruits that resemble a small apple. The plant produces flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. The fruit's pulp is rich in nutrients, including vitamins A and C, and has a sweet, nutty flavor. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in the Andean region."
