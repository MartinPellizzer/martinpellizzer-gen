    "intro": "Lithophragma micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry plant, is a flowering perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, similar to strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Lithophragma micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
