    "intro": "Lepechinia mollis, commonly known as the soft lepechinia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
