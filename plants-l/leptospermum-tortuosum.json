    "intro": "Leptospermum tortuosum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is in stabilizing dune systems."
