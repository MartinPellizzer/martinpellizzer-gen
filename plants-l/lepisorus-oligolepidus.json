    "intro": "Lepisorus oligolepidus, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Lepisorus oligolepidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
