    "intro": "Lupinus cardenasianus, commonly known as the C\u00e1rdenas lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. Lupinus cardenasianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
