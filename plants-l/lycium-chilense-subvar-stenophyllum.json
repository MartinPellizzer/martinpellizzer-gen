    "intro": "Lycium chilense subvar. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wolfberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in coastal areas and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The berries are edible and have been used traditionally for their nutritional and medicinal properties."
