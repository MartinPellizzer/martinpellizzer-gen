    "intro": "Lechea cinerea var. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened by environmental changes and human activity."
