It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that resemble almonds in shape, hence its common name. It produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a woody cupule, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it plays a role in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
