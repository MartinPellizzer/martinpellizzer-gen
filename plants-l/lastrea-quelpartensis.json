It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near freshwater habitats such as swamps and marshes. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
