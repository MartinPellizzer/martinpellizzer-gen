It features slender, upright stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in loose clusters. Its foliage is characterized by its sharp, pointed leaf tips and a slightly hairy texture. Lygistum acutifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover in shaded environments."
