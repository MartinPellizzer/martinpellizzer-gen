It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, often found in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Lappula uncinata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecology."
