    "intro": "Lesquerella prostrata, commonly known as creeping lesquerella, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are often used in industrial applications due to their high oil content. Lesquerella prostrata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
