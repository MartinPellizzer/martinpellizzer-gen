    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous woodrush, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. The flowers, which are usually greenish or white, bloom in late spring to early summer."
