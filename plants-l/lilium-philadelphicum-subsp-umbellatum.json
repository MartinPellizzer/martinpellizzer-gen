    "intro": "Lilium philadelphicum subsp. umbellatum, commonly known as the umbellate lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, often with a red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has strap-like, grassy leaves. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive winter dormancy. The subspecies is distinguished by its umbel-like arrangement of flowers, which sets it apart from other lily species."
