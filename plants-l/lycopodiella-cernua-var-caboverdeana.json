    "intro": "Lycopodiella cernua var. caboverdeana, commonly known as the Cape Verde clubmoss, is a small, low-growing fern-like plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
