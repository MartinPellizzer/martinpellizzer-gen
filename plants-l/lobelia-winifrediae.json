    "intro": "Lobelia winifrediae, commonly known as Winifred's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
