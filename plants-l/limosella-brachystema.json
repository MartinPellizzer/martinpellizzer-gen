    "intro": "Limosella brachystema, commonly known as sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal flats and salt marshes. The plant produces tiny, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid or salty conditions. Limosella brachystema plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
