    "intro": "Lepigonum macrarhizon, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Lepigonum macrarhizon plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
