    "intro": "Lightfootia unidentata var. lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a feature typical of many clubmosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary relationship to ancient plant groups, showcasing features that link it to early land plants."
