    "intro": "Linum mucronatum subsp. mucronatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Its fibrous stems were historically used for textile production, similar to other flax species."
