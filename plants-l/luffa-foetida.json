    "intro": "Luffa foetida, commonly known as stinkcucumber, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant produces large, green, lobed leaves and yellow flowers, with the fruit being a rough, fibrous gourd that matures to a pale yellow or orange color. The fruit is often used for its spongy interior, which can be dried and used as a natural loofah. However, the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the mature fruit."
