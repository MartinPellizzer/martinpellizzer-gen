    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum f. groenlandicum, commonly known as the Greenland clubmoss, is a rare and small evergreen fern-like plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra or heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
