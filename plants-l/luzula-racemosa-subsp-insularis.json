    "intro": "Luzula racemosa subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain island regions of the Pacific. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth form and specific habitat preferences compared to other Luzula species."
