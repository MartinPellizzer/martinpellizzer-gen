    "intro": "Lactuca singularis, commonly known as the slender lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seed heads that resemble those of dandelions. Lactuca singularis is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter flavor, making it a lesser-known but versatile vegetable."
