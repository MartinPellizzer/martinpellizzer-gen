It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
