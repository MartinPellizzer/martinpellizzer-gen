It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plants are native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Lychnocephalus species are often found in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
