It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow with four petals. Lepidium pseudodidymum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
