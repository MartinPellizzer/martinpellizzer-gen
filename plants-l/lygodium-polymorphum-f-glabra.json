It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually compound, with multiple pinnae that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its distinguishing name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season."
