It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, hairy stems that bear small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage consists of kidney-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
