    "intro": "Lepicystis polypodioides var. ecklonii, commonly known as the Ecklon's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
