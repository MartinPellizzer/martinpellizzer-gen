    "intro": "Liparis rockii, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often hairy growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Liparis rockii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
