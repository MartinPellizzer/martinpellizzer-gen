    "intro": "Lindernia dilatata var. anagallidea, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
