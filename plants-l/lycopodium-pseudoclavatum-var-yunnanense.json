    "intro": "Lycopodium pseudoclavatum var. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. This variant is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations to its native habitat."
