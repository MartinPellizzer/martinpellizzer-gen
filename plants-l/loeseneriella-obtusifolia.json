    "intro": "Loeseneriella obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crustose growth form and a pale to dark yellowish-green thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Loeseneriella obtusifolia is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
