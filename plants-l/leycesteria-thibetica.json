It features slender, arching branches and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
