    "intro": "Lythrum acinifolium f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved purple coneflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, spike-like clusters of deep purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for wetland or bog gardens. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
