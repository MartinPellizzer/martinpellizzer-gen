    "intro": "Libanotis athamantoides, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, with five petals that are recurved at the tips. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Libanotis athamantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
