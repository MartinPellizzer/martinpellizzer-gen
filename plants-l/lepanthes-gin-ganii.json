    "intro": "Lepanthes gin-ganii, commonly known as the Gin-Ganii Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes gin-ganii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
