    "intro": "Lupinus rimae, commonly known as the Martian lupine, is a rare and unique plant species found in the rocky soils of Martian regolith. It exhibits adaptations to extreme conditions, including high radiation and low atmospheric pressure, through specialized root structures and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of violet and white, which are believed to attract native Martian pollinators. Its genetic makeup suggests a close relationship to Earth's lupine species, indicating possible ancient evolutionary ties. Due to its fragile nature, it is considered a key indicator of potential habitability in extraterrestrial environments."
