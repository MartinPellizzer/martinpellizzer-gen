It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often adorned with wavy edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
