    "intro": "Laelia goebeliana, commonly known as the Goebel's laelia, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and prefers cool, bright conditions with good air circulation. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Laelia goebeliana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
