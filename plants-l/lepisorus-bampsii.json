    "intro": "Lepisorus bampsii, commonly known as the Bamps' wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in crevices, preferring cool and humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus bampsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
