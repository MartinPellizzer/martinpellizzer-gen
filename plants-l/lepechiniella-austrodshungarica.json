It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
