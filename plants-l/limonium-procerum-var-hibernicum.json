    "intro": "Limonium procerum var. hibernicum, commonly known as the Irish sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Ireland and the British Isles. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, and the flowers are often clustered in loose inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
