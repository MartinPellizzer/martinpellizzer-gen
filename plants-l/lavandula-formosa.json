    "intro": "Lavandula formosa, commonly known as woolly lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and spikes of purple-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Lavandula formosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
