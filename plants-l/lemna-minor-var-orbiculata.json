    "intro": "Lemna minor var. orbiculata, commonly known as the greater duckweed, is a small, aquatic plant that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with each frond producing numerous daughter plants. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Due to its fast growth rate, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, both as a food source and as an indicator of water quality."
