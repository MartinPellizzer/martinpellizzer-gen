    "intro": "Lacostea guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss, Lacostea guianensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
