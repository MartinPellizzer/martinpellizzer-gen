    "intro": "Lipochaeta bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Lipochaeta bryanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
