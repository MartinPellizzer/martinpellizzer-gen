    "intro": "Lotus levieri, commonly known as the Sierra lotus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and has a fibrous root system adapted to rocky soils. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
