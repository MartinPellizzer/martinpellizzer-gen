    "intro": "Lessingianthus monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is erect and often branched. The flower head consists of a single central bloom surrounded by ray florets, making it visually striking and attractive to pollinators."
