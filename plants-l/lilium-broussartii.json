    "intro": "Lilium broussartii, commonly known as the Broussart's lily, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lilium broussartii is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
