    "intro": "Lissochilus, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Lissochilus species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a velvety texture, giving them their common name. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Their unique botanical features make them popular among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
