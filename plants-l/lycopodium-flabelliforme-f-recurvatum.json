    "intro": "Lycopodium flabelliforme f. recurvatum, commonly known as the recurved clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. This variety is distinguished by its recurved leaves, which curve backward, creating a unique foliage structure. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant is notable for its ancient lineage, having evolved over 400 million years ago."
