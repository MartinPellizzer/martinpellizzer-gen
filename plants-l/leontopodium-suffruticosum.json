It is characterized by its dense, white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by a layer of soft, woolly bracts. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its growth is slow, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and symbolic significance, it is often considered a rare and protected species."
