    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its classification under the genus Lathyrus places it within the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. This variety is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to other Lathyrus species, making it a notable ornamental and ecological plant."
