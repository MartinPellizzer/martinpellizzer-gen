    "intro": "Leucopogon flavescens var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
