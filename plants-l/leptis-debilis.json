    "intro": "Leptis debilis, commonly known as the slender leptis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers, which are often pale blue or violet, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leptis debilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
