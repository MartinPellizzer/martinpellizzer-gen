    "intro": "Lotus namulensis, commonly known as the Namu lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its leaves are heart-shaped and float on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lotus namulensis is considered vulnerable in its native range."
