    "intro": "Lastrea glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular lastrea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, glandular bumps, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a distinctive species within the Aizoaceae family."
