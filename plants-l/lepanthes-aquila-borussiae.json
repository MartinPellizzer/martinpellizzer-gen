    "intro": "Lepanthes aquila-borussiae, commonly known as the Borussia Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are predominantly white with purple and green markings, which help in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
