    "intro": "Lithospermum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone lithosperm, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and limestone outcrops, exhibiting a compact growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Lithospermum calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
