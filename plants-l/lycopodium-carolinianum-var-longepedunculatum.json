    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long-peduncled clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support the spore cones, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
