    "intro": "Leucosyke bornensis, commonly known as the Born\u00e9an whitebark, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and woody, shrub-like growth habit. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has adapted to the high rainfall and warm climate of its native region. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
