    "intro": "Liparis labiata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a spiral, while its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network. Liparis labiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
