    "intro": "Leandra pallida var. caparoensis, commonly known as the Caparoensis Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean, specifically found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant scent. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
