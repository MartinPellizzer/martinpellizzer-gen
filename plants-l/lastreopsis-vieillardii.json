It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or stone in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure includes a cortex, medulla, and algal layers, making it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
