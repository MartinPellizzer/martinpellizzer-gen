    "intro": "Lactuca transnokoensis, commonly known as Transnoko lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of Central Africa and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
