It features a slender, branched stem that grows up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with toothed edges, and are often covered in a fine pubescence. Lapsana ramosissima is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, thriving in full sun."
