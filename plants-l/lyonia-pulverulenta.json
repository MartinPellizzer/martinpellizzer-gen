    "intro": "Lyonia pulverulenta, commonly known as the scarlet flame or sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval, red berries that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. Lyonia pulverulenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
