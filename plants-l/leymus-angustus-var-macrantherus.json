It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
