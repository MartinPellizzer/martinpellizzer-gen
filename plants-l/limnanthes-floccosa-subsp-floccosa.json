    "intro": "Limnanthes floccosa subsp. floccosa, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its common name reflects the dense, woolly texture of its foliage and petals."
