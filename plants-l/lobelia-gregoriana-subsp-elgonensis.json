    "intro": "Lobelia gregoriana subsp. elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and grasslands. The plant features whorled leaves and produces striking blue to purple tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern."
