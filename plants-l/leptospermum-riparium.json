    "intro": "Leptospermum riparium, commonly known as river tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows along riverbanks and rocky shores, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Leptospermum riparium is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
