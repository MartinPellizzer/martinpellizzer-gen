    "intro": "Lithocardium subpubescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
