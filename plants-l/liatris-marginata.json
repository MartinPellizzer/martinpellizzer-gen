    "intro": "Liatris marginata, commonly known as the purpletop blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy purple-pink flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in a cylindrical shape at the top of the stem. Liatris marginata thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from summer into early fall."
