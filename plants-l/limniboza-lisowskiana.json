    "intro": "Limniboza lisowskiana, commonly known as the Svalbard dwarf pine, is a rare and resilient plant species native to the Arctic regions of Svalbard. It is a small evergreen shrub that thrives in the extreme cold and permafrost conditions of its habitat. The plant has needle-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Its cones are small and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in isolated areas. Limniboza lisowskiana plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various Arctic organisms."
