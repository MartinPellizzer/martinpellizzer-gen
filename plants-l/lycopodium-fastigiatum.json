    "intro": "Lycopodium fastigiatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in forest undergrowth. Its historical use in traditional medicine and horticultural interest have contributed to its recognition in botanical studies."
