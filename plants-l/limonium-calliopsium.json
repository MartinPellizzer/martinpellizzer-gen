    "intro": "Limonium calliopsium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize dunes. Limonium calliopsium plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to coastal biodiversity."
