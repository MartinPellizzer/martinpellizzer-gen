    "intro": "Lasiodiscus mildbraedii subsp. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty disc lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, disc-like thallus. It typically grows on bark and stone in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The thallus is covered with a dense layer of fungal hyphae, giving it a leathery texture. Its color ranges from pale yellow to reddish-brown, with a prominent, granular upper surface. The species is notable for its chemical composition, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
