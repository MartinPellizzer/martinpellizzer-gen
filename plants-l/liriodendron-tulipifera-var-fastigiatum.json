    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera var. fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tulip tree, is a variant of the tulip poplar native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces showy, tulip-like yellow flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. This variety is valued for its upright growth habit and distinct foliage, which adds visual interest to the landscape."
