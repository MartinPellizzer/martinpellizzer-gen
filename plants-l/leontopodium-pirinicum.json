    "intro": "Leontopodium pirinicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathians. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of mountainous wilderness. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
