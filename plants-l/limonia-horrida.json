    "intro": "Limonia horrida, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, rough-textured fruit. Limonia horrida is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its fruit and its use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, coastal environments."
