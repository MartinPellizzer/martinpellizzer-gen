    "intro": "Lophiolepis boujartii, commonly known as the Boujart's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on bark or stone in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely granular surface texture. It lacks distinct lobes but may have a low, irregularly bordered margin. This lichen is often found in regions with moderate to high humidity and is used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution."
