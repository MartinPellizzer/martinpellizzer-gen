    "intro": "Larix gmelinii var. cajanderi, commonly known as the Korean larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch, native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a deciduous conifer that produces small, cone-like structures containing seeds. The tree has needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before shedding, and its bark is typically reddish-brown with a fissured texture. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in forest ecosystems at high altitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage and resilience."
