    "intro": "Lycopodium filicaulon, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodium filicaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats."
