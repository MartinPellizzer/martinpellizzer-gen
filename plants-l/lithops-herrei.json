    "intro": "Lithops herrei, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flower that blooms in shades of yellow and orange. Lithops herrei typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
