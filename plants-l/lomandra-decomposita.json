    "intro": "Lomandra decomposita, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spring. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought. Lomandra decomposita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal environments."
