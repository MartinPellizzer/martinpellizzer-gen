    "intro": "Lenda subtriphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf lenda, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Lenda subtriphylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native gardens."
