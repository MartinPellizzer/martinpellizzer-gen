    "intro": "Lachemilla mutellina, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in specialized collections."
