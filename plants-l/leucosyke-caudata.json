    "intro": "Leucosyke caudata, commonly known as the trailing milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Leucosyke caudata is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in dry environments."
