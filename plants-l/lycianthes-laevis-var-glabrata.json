    "intro": "Lycianthes laevis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth physalis, is a variant of the common groundcherry. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of Mexico and Central America. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which turn orange-red when mature. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though it is less commonly grown than other physalis varieties."
