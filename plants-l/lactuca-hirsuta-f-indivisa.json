    "intro": "Lactuca hirsuta f. indivisa, commonly known as the hairy lettuce or wild lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically more robust and less bitter than those of cultivated lettuce varieties. The plant produces small, green flowers in the summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
