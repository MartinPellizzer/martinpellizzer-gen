    "intro": "Leucophyllum candidum, commonly known as Texas betony, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, compact growth and gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
