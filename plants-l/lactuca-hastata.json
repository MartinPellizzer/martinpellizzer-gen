    "intro": "Lactuca hastata, commonly known as the hairy lettuce or prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
