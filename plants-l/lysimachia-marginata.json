    "intro": "Lysimachia marginata, commonly known as yellow loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellow margin. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Lysimachia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
