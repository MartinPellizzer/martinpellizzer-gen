    "intro": "Liabum stipulatum, commonly known as the stipule leafcup, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and often have stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in the summer and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
