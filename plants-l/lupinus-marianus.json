    "intro": "Lupinus marianus, commonly known as the Carolina lupine, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus marianus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
