    "intro": "Linociera littorea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to the eastern coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange with five petals. It produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. Linociera littorea is often used in coastal stabilization due to its ability to thrive in harsh maritime environments."
