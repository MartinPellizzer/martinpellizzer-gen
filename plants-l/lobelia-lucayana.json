    "intro": "Lobelia lucayana, commonly known as the Lucayan lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
