    "intro": "Lachnaea densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the necessary photosynthetic function. Its dense, compact growth habit allows it to retain moisture effectively in its preferred habitat. Lachnaea densiflora is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions."
