It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is a perennial species that produces its flowers in late spring to early summer. The orchid has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
