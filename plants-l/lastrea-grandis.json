    "intro": "Lastrea grandis, commonly known as the grand star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
