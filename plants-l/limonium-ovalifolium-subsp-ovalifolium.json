    "intro": "Limonium ovalifolium subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-adapted to saline and windy environments. Its narrow, oval-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette, and the flowers are borne on tall, slender stems. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
