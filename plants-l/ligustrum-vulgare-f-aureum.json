    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare f. aureum, commonly known as the golden privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with some cultivars displaying a striking golden-yellow hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
