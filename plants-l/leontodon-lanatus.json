    "intro": "Leontodon lanatus, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear a single inflorescence at the tip. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat."
