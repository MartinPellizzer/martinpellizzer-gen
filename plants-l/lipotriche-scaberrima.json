    "intro": "Lipotriche scaberrima, commonly known as the roughleaf germander, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Lipotriche scaberrima is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
