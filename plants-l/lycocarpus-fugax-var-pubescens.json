    "intro": "Lycocarpus fugax var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy hill cobra, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a hairy texture. The plant produces sporangia that are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species within its native habitat."
