    "intro": "Litsea vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's litsea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed, and it is often found in lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Lauraceae family."
