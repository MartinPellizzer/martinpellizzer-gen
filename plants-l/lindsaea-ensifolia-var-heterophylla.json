It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The varietal form, heterophylla, exhibits variations in leaf shape and size, contributing to its adaptability in different microhabitats."
