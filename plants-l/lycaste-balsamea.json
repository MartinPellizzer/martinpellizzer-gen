    "intro": "Lycaste balsamea, commonly known as the balsam orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and lavender. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pendulous inflorescences. Lycaste balsamea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
