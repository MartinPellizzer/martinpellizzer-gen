    "intro": "Lycopodium fontinaloides var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican ground pine, is a species of clubmoss native to Mexico. It is a small, evergreen plant that forms dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally around the stem, giving it a pine-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its ancient lineage in the lycophyte group. This variety is often found in moist, humid environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
