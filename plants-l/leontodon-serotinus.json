    "intro": "Leontodon serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, hence its common name. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with prominent central disk."
