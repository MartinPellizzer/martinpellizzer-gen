It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological niche."
