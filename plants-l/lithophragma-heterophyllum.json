    "intro": "Lithophragma heterophyllum, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Lithophragma heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
