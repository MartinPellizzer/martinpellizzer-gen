    "intro": "Lathyrus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese vetch, is a climbing legume native to East Asia. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in traditional herbal medicine."
