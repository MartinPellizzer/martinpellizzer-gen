    "intro": "Loranthus dregei var. ovatus, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are edible for some bird species, play a role in seed dispersal. This species is native to southern Africa and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
