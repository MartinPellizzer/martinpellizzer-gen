    "intro": "Linaria broussonetii var. ignescens, commonly known as the flame linaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, orange-red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
