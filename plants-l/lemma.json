    "intro": "Lemma, commonly known as a type of bract found in grasses, is a modified leaf that encloses the flower in the inflorescence. It typically forms the lower portion of the spikelet and often resembles a small, scale-like structure. Lemmas are usually tough and leathery, providing protection to the developing florets. They can vary in shape, size, and color depending on the species of grass. In some cases, lemmas are used in traditional medicine or as a source of food for animals."
