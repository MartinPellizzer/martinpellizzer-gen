    "intro": "Laricorchis rigida, commonly known as the rigid tassel orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near coniferous forests. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the elongated, tassel-like inflorescence that bears small, pale green to white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
