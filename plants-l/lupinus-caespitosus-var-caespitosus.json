It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus caespitosus var. caespitosus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
