It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, spirally twisted clusters around its stems. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophylls, bear spore-producing organs called sporangia. Lycopodioides plagiochila plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
