    "intro": "Larrea, commonly known as creosote bush, is a hardy shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Larrea is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems and the ability to resprout after fires or drought. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
