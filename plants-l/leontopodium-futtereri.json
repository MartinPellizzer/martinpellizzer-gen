    "intro": "Leontopodium futtereri, commonly known as the Alpine edelweiss, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale green foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology, including the rosette-like arrangement of its leaves, helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is also a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems."
