It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in salty and windy environments. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium intermedium is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
