It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate with a glossy surface, and it produces small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves. Lankesteria glandulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
