    "intro": "Lomariocycas aurata, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its unique, feather-like leaves that emit a golden hue under sunlight. The plant produces a striking, cone-like structure known as a strobilus, which contains its seeds. Lomariocycas aurata is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
