    "intro": "Lespedeza fruticosa, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, gray-green leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry habitats. Lespedeza fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
