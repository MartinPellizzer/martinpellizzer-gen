    "intro": "Lyonothamnus aspleniifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are leathery and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
