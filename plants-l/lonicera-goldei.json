    "intro": "Lonicera goldei, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Lonicera goldei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
