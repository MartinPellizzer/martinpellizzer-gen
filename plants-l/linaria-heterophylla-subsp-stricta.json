    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
