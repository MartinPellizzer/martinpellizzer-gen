It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. Lappula velutina is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
