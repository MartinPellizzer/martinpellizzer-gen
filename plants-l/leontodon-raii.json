    "intro": "Leontodon raii, commonly known as the rare alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leontodon raii is considered a rare and endangered species."
