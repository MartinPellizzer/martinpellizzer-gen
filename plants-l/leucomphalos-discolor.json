    "intro": "Leucomphalos discolor, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that range in color from gray-green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Leucomphalos discolor is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the spice bush swallowtail."
