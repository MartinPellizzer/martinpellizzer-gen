    "intro": "Lebidiera laurina, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces long, pendulous seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Lebidiera laurina is a vigorous climber that can grow up to 20 feet in height, making it a popular choice for trellises and arbors. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
