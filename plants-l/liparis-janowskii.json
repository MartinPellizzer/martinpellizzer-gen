    "intro": "Liparis janowskii, commonly known as the Janowski's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Liparis janowskii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
