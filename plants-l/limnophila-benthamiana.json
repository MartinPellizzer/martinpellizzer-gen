    "intro": "Limnophila benthamiana, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its stems can form dense mats on the water surface. Limnophila benthamiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
