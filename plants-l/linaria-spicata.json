    "intro": "Linaria spicata, commonly known as the spiked toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, linear leaves and has a long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn. Linaria spicata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
