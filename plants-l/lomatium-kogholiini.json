    "intro": "Lomatium kogholiini, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like foliage that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Lomatium kogholiini is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties."
