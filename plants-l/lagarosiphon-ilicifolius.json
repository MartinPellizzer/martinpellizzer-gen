    "intro": "Lagarosiphon ilicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Hydrocharitaceae family and typically grows in freshwater habitats such as lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in clusters. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and can form dense vegetation in aquatic environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
