    "intro": "Lotus tingitanus, commonly known as the Moroccan lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that extend into the water. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a valuable species in wetland ecosystems. Lotus tingitanus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional medicine."
