    "intro": "Lepanthes thurstoniorum, commonly known as the Thurston's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its humid, tropical environment. Lepanthes thurstoniorum is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the canopy's filtered light."
