It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal and open habitats, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is closely related to the common manuka and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
