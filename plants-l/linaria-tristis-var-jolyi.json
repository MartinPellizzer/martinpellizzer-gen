It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, elongated seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. It prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Linaria tristis var. jolyi is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
