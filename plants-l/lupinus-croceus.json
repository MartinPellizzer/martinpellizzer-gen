    "intro": "Lupinus croceus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus croceus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
