It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually green and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Lepanthes cardenasii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
