    "intro": "Leucanthemum platylepis, commonly known as the broadleaf white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, dark green leaves and its showy yellow-orange flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous small, composite flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
