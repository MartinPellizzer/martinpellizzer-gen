    "intro": "Lindera subsericea, commonly known as silverleaf arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are thinly covered with a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Lindera subsericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
