    "intro": "Lellingeria suprasculpta, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the orchid family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
