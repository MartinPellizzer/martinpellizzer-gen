    "intro": "Lemurangis pseudopetiolata, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
