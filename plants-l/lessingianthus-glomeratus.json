It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
