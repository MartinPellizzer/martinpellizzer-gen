    "intro": "Leontopodium linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround a central cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with alpine meadows and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
