The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, red, fleshy berries that contain multiple seeds. This plant is closely related to the domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and is often studied for its genetic traits."
