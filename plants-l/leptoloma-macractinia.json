    "intro": "Leptoloma macractinia, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Lepiotaceae. It is characterized by its large, white, spherical fruiting body that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The fungus is typically found in grassy areas and woodlands, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with the roots of various plants. Its spore-bearing surface, known as the gleba, turns from white to yellowish as it matures. Leptoloma macractinia is edible when young but becomes inedible and toxic as it matures."
