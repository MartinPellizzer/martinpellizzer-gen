It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing a low-growing, shrub-like habit. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
