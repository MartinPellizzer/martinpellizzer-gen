It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, spatulate inflorescences with a yellow spathe and a white spadix, typical of many arum species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
