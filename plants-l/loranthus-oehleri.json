    "intro": "Loranthus oehleri, commonly known as the Oehleri mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in pairs, while its flowers are small and often greenish-white in color. Loranthus oehleri plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, and it is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
