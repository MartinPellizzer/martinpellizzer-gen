    "intro": "Lecanosperma, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. Lecanosperma species are often associated with mangrove ecosystems, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Their fruits are usually fleshy and serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
