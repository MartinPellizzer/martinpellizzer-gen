    "intro": "Leucopogon collinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Leucopogon collinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
