    "intro": "Lupinus lyallii subsp. alcis-temporis, commonly known as the Alcis-temporis lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators and herbivores."
