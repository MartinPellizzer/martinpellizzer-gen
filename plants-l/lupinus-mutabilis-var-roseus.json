    "intro": "Lupinus mutabilis var. roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, rose-pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in dense, spires during the summer months. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
