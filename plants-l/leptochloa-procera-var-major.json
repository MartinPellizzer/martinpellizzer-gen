It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
