    "intro": "Lophostylis floribunda, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its fibrous, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves. Its fibrous bark has been historically used by M\u0101ori for making clothing, ropes, and other woven items. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
