    "intro": "Lycoctonum koisikawense, commonly known as the Koisikawa nightshade, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its striking violet flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
