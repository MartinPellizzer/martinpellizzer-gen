    "intro": "Linum kingii var. pinetorum, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It produces delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, linear leaves and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to other members of the Linaceae family, though it exhibits unique adaptations to its harsh coastal environment."
