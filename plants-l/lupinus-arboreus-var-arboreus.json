It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets and produces spires of blue to purple pea-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. As a member of the legume family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
