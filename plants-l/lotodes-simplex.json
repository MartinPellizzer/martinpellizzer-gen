    "intro": "Lotodes simplex, commonly known as the water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive yellow center, and they open during the day. Lotodes simplex plays an important role in water ecosystems by improving water quality and providing shelter for fish and invertebrates."
