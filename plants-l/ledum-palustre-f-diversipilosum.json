    "intro": "Ledum palustre f. diversipilosum, commonly known as the hairy Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive foliage, which consists of oval, leathery leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves and stems contain aromatic compounds, including labdane-type diterpenes, which contribute to its medicinal and ecological significance. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks."
