    "intro": "Lupinus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus stenophyllus is valued for its ecological role and has been used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
