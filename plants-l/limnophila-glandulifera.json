    "intro": "Limnophila glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular water willow, is a wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered with glandular dots. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Limnophila glandulifera plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
