It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and historical significance in traditional medicine."
