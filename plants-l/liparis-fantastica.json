    "intro": "Liparis fantastica, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It features striking, iridescent petals that shift in color depending on light conditions, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant's roots are highly sensitive to moisture, requiring a consistently damp yet well-draining environment to thrive. Its flowering season occurs during the rainy season, producing delicate, fragrant blooms that last only a few days. Botanists are particularly interested in its genetic makeup due to its unusual resistance to certain fungal diseases."
