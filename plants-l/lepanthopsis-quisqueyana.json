    "intro": "Lepanthopsis quisqueyana, commonly known as the Quechua orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, which is typical of many orchid species. Lepanthopsis quisqueyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
