    "intro": "Lahaya tenuifolia, commonly known as slender leaf lahay, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
