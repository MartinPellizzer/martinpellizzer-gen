    "intro": "Lotodes balsamicum, commonly known as the balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
