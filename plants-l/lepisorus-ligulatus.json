    "intro": "Lepisorus ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
