    "intro": "Leptospermum speciosum, commonly known as the silky tea tree, is a shrub native to Tasmania, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies and for their essential oils. Leptospermum speciosum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
