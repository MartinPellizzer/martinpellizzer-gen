    "intro": "Loranthus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in threes, giving it its scientific name. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. While it is not toxic to humans, it can cause stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
