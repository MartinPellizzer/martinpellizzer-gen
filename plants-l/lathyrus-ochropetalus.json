    "intro": "Lathyrus ochropetalus, commonly known as the yellow vetchling, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a climbing habit due to its slender, twining stems. Lathyrus ochropetalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
