    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria f. glabrum, commonly known as narrow-leaved loosestrife, is a variant of the common loosestrife plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are generally smooth and hairless, giving it its \"glabrum\" designation. Its showy, pink to red flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
