It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its unique adaptations to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, often blue or purple-hued leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to bloom throughout the year makes it a striking addition to any drought-tolerant landscape."
