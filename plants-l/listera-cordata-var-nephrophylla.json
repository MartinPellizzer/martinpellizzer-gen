    "intro": "Listera cordata var. nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidneyleaf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white to pale green pubescence. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-poor soils."
