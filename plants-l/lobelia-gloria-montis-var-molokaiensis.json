    "intro": "Lobelia gloria-montis var. molokaiensis, commonly known as Moloka\u02bbi lobelia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Moloka\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to lavender. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by native bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
