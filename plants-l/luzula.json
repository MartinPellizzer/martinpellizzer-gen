    "intro": "Luzula, commonly known as wood rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are characterized by their grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Luzula species often have a rhizomatous or stolonic growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense mats. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
