    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. incanus, commonly known as the silverweed or goat's beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its seed pods are elongated and often contain several small, dark seeds. The variety incanus is distinguished by its more pronounced silvery hairs compared to the typical form of Lotus corniculatus."
