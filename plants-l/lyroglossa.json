    "intro": "Lyroglossa, commonly known as the \"woundwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a delicate, aromatic scent. Lyroglossa species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in leaf structure and flowering habits."
