    "intro": "Lycium glandulosissimum, commonly known as the glandular boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that appear in late summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
