    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris var. unijugus, commonly known as the single-jugate wood vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a single pair of leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, often growing along stream banks or in shaded areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
