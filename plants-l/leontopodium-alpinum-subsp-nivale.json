    "intro": "Leontopodium alpinum subsp. nivale, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense white or pale yellow fuzzy bracts that surround the small yellow flower heads. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its growth is slow, and it is often found in meadows and alpine tundras. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
