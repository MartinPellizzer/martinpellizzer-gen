    "intro": "Limodorum abortivum f. thracum, commonly known as the Thrace orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
