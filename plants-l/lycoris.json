    "intro": "Lycoris, commonly known as the \"Chinese lantern\" or \"red spider lily,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in the fall, often accompanied by narrow, grass-like leaves. Lycoris species are native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and they thrive in woodland and shady environments. The plant's bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive through seasonal changes. Its foliage and floral display make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
