    "intro": "Lupinus heptaphyllus, commonly known as the seven-leaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of seven leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Lupinus heptaphyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine by some indigenous communities."
