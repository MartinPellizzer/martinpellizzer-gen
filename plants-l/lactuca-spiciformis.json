    "intro": "Lactuca spiciformis, commonly known as the spiky lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiky, bract-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a spiky inflorescence, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Lactuca spiciformis is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
