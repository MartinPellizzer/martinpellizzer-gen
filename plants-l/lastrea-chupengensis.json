    "intro": "Lastrea chupengensis, commonly known as the Chupeng lastrea, is a rare succulent native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
