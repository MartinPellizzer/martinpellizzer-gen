It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a fruit with a hard, spiky exterior. The fruit contains a sweet, golden-yellow pulp that is rich in nutrients and has a flavor similar to a mix of banana and mango. The plant is valued for its edible fruit and has cultural significance in indigenous communities. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
