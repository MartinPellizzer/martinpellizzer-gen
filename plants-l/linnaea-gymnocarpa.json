    "intro": "Linnaea gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed twinleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a capsule that remains closed until the seeds are mature, a unique adaptation that helps protect the seeds until the right conditions for germination are met."
