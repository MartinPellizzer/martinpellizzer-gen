It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of spiny, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Lupinus canaliculatus is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
