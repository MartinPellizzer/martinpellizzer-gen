    "intro": "Lespedeza cytisoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Lespedeza cytisoides is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
