    "intro": "Lycopodioides trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's stems are often prostrate or creeping, with a distinct branching pattern that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This ancient lineage of plants is closely related to modern ferns and mosses, showcasing early evolutionary adaptations in vascular plant development."
