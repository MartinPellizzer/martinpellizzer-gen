    "intro": "Lathyrus pauciflorus subsp. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds enclosed in pods, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
