    "intro": "Lobivia katagirii var. salmonea, commonly known as the salmon-pink lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn pinkish-red at the edges when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of vibrant pink to salmon-colored flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its striking coloration and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
