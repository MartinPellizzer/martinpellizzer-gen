    "intro": "Lepisorus paohuashanensis, commonly known as the Paohuashan water fern, is a rare and endemic species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that enhances its aesthetic appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
