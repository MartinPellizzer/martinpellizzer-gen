    "intro": "Lepisanthes tetraphylla var. cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian star orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
