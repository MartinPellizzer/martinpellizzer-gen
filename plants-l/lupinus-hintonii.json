    "intro": "Lupinus hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus hintonii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen, which enriches the soil for other plants."
