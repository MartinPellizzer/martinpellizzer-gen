    "intro": "Leighia lomatoneura, commonly known as the orchid with the twisted leaf, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its unique, twisted leaf structure and delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its intricate floral morphology is adapted for specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leighia lomatoneura is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
