    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejoi flax, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are similar to those of other flax species, though it is distinguished by its unique subspecific characteristics. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
