    "intro": "Lycaste peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian lycaste, is a species of orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in semi-shade environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil. Lycaste peruviana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
