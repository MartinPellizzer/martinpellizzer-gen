    "intro": "Lathyrus lanszwertii, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its pods contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Lathyrus lanszwertii is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
