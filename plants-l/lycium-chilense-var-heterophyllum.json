    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red berries that are edible when ripe. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
