    "intro": "Lentibularia major, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Lentibularia major is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement its nutrient-poor habitat."
