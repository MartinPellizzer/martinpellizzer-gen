    "intro": "Leontodon, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow disk flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Leontodon species typically have rough, hairy leaves and produce seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
