    "intro": "Lagurostemon liatroides, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, often branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens."
