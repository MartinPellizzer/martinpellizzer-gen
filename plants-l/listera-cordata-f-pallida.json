    "intro": "Listera cordata f. pallida, commonly known as the pale heartleaf twayblade, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale green, heart-shaped leaves. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to eastern North America, it typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its delicate appearance and unique ecological role make it a notable species in woodland ecosystems."
