    "intro": "Linaria striata var. tristis, commonly known as the weedy toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
