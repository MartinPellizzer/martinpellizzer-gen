    "intro": "Leucosinapis, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Leucosinapis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in soil enrichment and is a common forage plant for livestock."
