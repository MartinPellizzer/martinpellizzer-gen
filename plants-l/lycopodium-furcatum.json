    "intro": "Lycopodium furcatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its primitive structure, featuring a stem with whorls of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically located at the base of the stem. Lycopodium furcatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
