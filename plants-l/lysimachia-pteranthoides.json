    "intro": "Lysimachia pteranthoides, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Lysimachia pteranthoides is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
