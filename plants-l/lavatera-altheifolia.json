    "intro": "Lavatera altheifolia, commonly known as the woolly sunhemp, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is an annual or biennial herb, typically growing up to 1.5 meters in height. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it adapted to arid environments. Lavatera altheifolia is also valued for its potential as a forage crop and for its ornamental appeal."
