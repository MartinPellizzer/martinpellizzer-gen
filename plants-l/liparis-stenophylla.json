    "intro": "Liparis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Liparis stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects."
