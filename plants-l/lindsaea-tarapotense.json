    "intro": "Lindsaea tarapotense, commonly known as the Tarapotense fern, is a species of polypodiales found in the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and is typically epiphytic, growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at higher elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
