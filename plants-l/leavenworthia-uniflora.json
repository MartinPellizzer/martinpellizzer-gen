    "intro": "Leavenworthia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
