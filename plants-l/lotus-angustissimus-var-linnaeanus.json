    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. linnaeanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding aesthetic value to ponds and wetlands. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a common sight in marshes and lakes."
