    "intro": "Lagoseris ruppelii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lagoseris ruppelii is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
