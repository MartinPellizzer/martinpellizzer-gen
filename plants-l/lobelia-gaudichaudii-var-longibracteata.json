    "intro": "Lobelia gaudichaudii var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract lobelia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is typically found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
