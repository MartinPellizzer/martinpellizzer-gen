    "intro": "Labichea rossii, commonly known as the Ross's labichea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are generally elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, Labichea rossii is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
