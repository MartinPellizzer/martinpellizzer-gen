It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
