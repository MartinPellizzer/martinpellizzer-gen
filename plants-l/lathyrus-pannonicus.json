    "intro": "Lathyrus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Lathyrus pannonicus plays a role in soil fixation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
