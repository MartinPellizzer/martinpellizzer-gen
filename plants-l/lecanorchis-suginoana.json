    "intro": "Lecanorchis suginoana, commonly known as the Sugino's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant is an epiphyte, growing on the bark of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowering period is brief, usually occurring in late spring or early summer, making it a challenging species to observe in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lecanorchis suginoana is considered a critically endangered species."
