    "intro": "Lespedeza shimadae, commonly known as Japanese lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Lespedeza shimadae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
