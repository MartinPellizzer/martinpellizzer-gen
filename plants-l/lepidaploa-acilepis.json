    "intro": "Lepidaploa acilepis, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidaploa acilepis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
