    "intro": "Leucopogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to regions of Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. Leucopogon species often thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are adapted to coastal or heathland environments. Their flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they play an important role in supporting local pollinators."
