    "intro": "Lotodes castoreum, commonly known as the beaver lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its flowers are composed of three petals and three sepals, typical of the monocot structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes."
