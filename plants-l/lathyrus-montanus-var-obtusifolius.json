It features slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often twining around supports. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rounded base and a smooth, slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in racemes, and bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in ecological and agricultural contexts."
