    "intro": "Lasiopus bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lasiopus bojeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
