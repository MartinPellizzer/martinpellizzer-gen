    "intro": "Linosyris bigelovii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy areas. Linosyris bigelovii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
