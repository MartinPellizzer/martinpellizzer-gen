It features small, white flowers with yellow centers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers."
