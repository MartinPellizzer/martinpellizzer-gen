    "intro": "Lychnophora trichocarpha var. robusta, commonly known as the robust hairy lychnophora, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive reddish-brown stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
