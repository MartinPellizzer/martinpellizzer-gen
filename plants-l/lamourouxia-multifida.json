    "intro": "Lamourouxia multifida, commonly known as the winged fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with small, wing-like structures along the leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
