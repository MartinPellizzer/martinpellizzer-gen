    "intro": "Lonchocarpus balsensis, commonly known as the Balsam tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to the presence of toxic compounds, it is not typically used for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
