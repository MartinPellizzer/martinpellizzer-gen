    "intro": "Lobelia benthamii, commonly known as the red-lobe lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant produces striking violet to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Lobelia benthamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
