    "intro": "Lindsaea lancea var. leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's staghorn fern, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows on trees or rock surfaces, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds and is often found in shaded, moist forest habitats."
