It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, smooth texture, which distinguishes it from other lobelia species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a member of the Campanulaceae family."
