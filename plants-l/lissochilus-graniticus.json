    "intro": "Lissochilus graniticus, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly in regions with rocky or granitic substrates. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Its root system is adapted to anchor itself in loose, mineral-rich soil, and it requires good drainage to prevent root rot. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
