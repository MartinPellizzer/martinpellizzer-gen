    "intro": "Lepidium pubicarpum, commonly known as the pubicarp sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive, branched root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant is also characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, capsule-like fruits."
