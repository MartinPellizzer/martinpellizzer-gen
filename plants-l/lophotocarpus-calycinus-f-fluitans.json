    "intro": "Lophotocarpus calycinus f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating water fern, is a unique variant of the water fern species. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that drift on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with ample sunlight, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its fronds are typically light green and have a waxy coating that helps them remain buoyant. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to purify water naturally."
