It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of pale pink to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
