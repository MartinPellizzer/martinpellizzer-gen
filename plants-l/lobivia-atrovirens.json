    "intro": "Lobivia atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are small, spiny, and often covered in a white powdery coating to reduce water loss. Lobivia atrovirens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
