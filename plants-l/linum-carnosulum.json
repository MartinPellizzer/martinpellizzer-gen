    "intro": "Linum carnosulum, commonly known as the woolly flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It belongs to the genus Linum, which includes other flax species, but is distinct for its thick, fleshy leaves and unique floral structure. Linum carnosulum is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and resilience."
