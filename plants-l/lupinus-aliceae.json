    "intro": "Lupinus aliceae, commonly known as Alice's lupin, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Lupinus aliceae is part of the legume family, which allows it to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
