    "intro": "Lonicera pampaninii, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in pairs. It thrives in partial to full sun and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
