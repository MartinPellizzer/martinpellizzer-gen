    "intro": "Lophopterys splendens var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the splendour lichen fern, is a rare and striking variety of the lichen fern genus. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are often bright green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its unique morphology and vibrant coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
