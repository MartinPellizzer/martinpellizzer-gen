    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine twinflower, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in subalpine and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing shrub with opposite, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
