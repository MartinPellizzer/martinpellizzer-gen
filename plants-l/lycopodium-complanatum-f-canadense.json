It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to form compact, cushion-like colonies. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. This fern ally is notable for its primitive reproductive structures and its role in certain ecological systems."
