    "intro": "Libanotis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long flowering period."
