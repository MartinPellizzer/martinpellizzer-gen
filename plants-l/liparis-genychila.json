It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Liparis genychila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
