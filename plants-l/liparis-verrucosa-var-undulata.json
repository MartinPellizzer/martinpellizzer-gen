    "intro": "Liparis verrucosa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland and marsh environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense clumps. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the waterlogged substrate. This variety is distinguished by its undulating leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet."
