    "intro": "Lycopodium phylicifolium, commonly known as the fragrant clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family, characterized by its primitive structure and spore-producing reproductive system. It is a small, evergreen plant with needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and rocky outcrops. Its foliage emits a subtle, aromatic scent, which may play a role in attracting spore dispersal agents. Lycopodium phylicifolium is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
