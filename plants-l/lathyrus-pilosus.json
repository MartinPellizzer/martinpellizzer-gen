    "intro": "Lathyrus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus pilosus is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a versatile plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
