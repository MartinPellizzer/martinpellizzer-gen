    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis proles crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
