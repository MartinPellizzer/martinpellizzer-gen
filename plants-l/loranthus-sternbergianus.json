    "intro": "Loranthus sternbergianus, commonly known as the Sternberg's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in forested areas where its host trees are abundant."
