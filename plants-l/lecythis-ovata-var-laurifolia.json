    "intro": "Lecythis ovata var. laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or laurifolia lecythis, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, glossy, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the laurel family. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits with a thick, spiky rind that encases a single large, oily seed. The seed is valued for its high oil content, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
