It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, floating leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Limnanthemum exiguum plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
