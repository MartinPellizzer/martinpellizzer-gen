    "intro": "Lepanthes insectiflora, commonly known as the insect-flowered orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with intricate patterns and a unique structure that enhances its mimicry of insect forms. Lepanthes insectiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
