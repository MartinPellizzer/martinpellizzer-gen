It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in late spring, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
