    "intro": "Lichenora, commonly known as the lichen-forming genus, is a group of symbiotic organisms composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. These organisms are found in a variety of habitats, including trees, rocks, and soil, and they play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil formation. Lichenora species are known for their slow growth and ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions. They are often used as bioindicators due to their sensitivity to air pollution. The morphology of Lichenora varies, with some species forming crust-like structures while others develop foliose or fruticose forms."
