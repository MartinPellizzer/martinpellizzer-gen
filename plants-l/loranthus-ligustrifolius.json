    "intro": "Loranthus ligustrifolius, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds. This species plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing tree growth and providing habitat for various wildlife."
