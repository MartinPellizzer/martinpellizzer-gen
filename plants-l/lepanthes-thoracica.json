    "intro": "Lepanthes thoracica, commonly known as the chestnut orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes thoracica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
