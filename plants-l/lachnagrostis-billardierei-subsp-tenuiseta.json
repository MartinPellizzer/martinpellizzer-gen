It features narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hairy texture, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
