It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in seasonal climates. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, with a distinct three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators.
