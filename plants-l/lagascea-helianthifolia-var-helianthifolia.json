    "intro": "Lagascea helianthifolia var. helianthifolia, commonly known as the yellow evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the family Onagraceae and is noted for its medicinal properties due to the presence of gamma-linolenic acid in its seeds."
