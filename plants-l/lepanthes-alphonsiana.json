    "intro": "Lepanthes alphonsiana, commonly known as the Alphonsa's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that resemble small slippers, which are typical of the Lepanthes genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil. Lepanthes alphonsiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure."
