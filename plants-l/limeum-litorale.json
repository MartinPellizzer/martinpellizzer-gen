    "intro": "Limeum litorale, commonly known as sea lime or coastal lime, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid environments. Its small, pale green flowers are typically clustered and bloom in early spring. Limeum litorale plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sands and preventing erosion."
