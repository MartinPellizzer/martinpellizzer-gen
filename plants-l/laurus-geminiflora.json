It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of dark green, leathery leaves with a fragrant aroma. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
