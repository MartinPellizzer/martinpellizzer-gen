    "intro": "Lastrea rufidula, commonly known as the red-stemmed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Lastrea rufidula is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
