    "intro": "Lotus coimbrensis, commonly known as the Coimbatore lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South India. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
