    "intro": "Linaria ramosissima var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its branched stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which helps deter herbivores. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
