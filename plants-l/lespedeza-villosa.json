    "intro": "Lespedeza villosa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hairy lespedeza is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, and it has been introduced to other parts of the world for erosion control. It is also valued as a forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional content."
