    "intro": "Litsea chunii, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the citrus family, Rutaceae, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces fruit that is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes worldwide. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
