It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody structure and aromatic foliage make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for coastal and sandy soils.
