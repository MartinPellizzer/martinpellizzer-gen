    "intro": "Limonium heraionense, commonly known as the Aegean sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Aegean Sea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. Limonium heraionense is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
