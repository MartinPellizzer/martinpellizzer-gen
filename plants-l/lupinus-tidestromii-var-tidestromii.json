    "intro": "Lupinus tidestromii var. tidestromii, commonly known as Tidestrom's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil enrichment and as a nectar source for pollinators."
