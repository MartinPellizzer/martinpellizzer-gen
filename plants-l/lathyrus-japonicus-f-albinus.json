    "intro": "Lathyrus japonicus f. albinus, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese vetch, is a botanical variant of the Japanese vetch species. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical purple or violet blooms of the species. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in gardens or wild areas with well-drained soil. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
