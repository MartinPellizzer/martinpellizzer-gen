    "intro": "Lacistema pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific lacistema, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal zones. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
