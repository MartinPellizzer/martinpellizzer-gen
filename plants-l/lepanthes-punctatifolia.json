    "intro": "Lepanthes punctatifolia, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spotted leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Lepanthes punctatifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
