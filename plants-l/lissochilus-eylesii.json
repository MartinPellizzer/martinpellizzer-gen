    "intro": "Lissochilus eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in high-altitude cloud forests. Its flowers are usually pale green to white with faintly colored petals, and it has a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
