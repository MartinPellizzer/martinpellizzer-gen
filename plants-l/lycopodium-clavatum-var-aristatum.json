    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear sporangia containing spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures and overall morphology are typical of ancient plant lineages, reflecting its evolutionary history."
