    "intro": "Lysimachia parvula, commonly known as small yellow mosquito plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shady ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Lysimachia parvula thrives in wet or damp environments, making it a common sight in woodland areas and along stream banks."
