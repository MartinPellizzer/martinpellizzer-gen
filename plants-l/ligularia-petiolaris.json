    "intro": "Ligularia petiolaris, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to add texture to shaded landscapes."
