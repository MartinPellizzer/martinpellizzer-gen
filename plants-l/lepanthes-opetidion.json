    "intro": "Lepanthes opetidion, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Lepanthes opetidion plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest ecosystem."
