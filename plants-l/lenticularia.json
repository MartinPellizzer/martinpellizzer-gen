    "intro": "Lenticularia, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water's surface. Lenticularia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them float and trap air, while their roots are submerged in water. The flowers are usually pink, white, or yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
