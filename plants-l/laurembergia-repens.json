    "intro": "Laurembergia repens, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. It is widely cultivated as a ground cover due to its ability to spread rapidly through runners. Laurembergia repens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
