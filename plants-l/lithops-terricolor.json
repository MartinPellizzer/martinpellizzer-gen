    "intro": "Lithops terricolor, commonly known as the \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Lithops terricolor thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
