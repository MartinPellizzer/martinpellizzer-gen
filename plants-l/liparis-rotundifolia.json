    "intro": "Liparis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
