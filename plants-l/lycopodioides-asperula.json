    "intro": "Lycopodioides asperula, commonly known as the rough spike moss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, and sparsely branched stems covered with dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides asperula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
