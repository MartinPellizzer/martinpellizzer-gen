    "intro": "Liatris fallacior, commonly known as the false purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spikes of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet prairies, marshes, and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the plant. Liatris fallacior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
