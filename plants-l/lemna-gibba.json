    "intro": "Lemna gibba, commonly known as the broad-leaf duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its floating, oval-shaped leaves that are typically broader than they are long. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on short stalks above the water surface. Lemna gibba thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for aquatic animals."
