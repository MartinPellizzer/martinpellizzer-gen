    "intro": "Lindsaea quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, quadrilateral-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attached to trees in humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Lindsaea quadrangularis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
