    "intro": "Luzula mannii subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Luzula mannii subsp. gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
