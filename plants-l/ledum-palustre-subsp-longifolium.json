    "intro": "Ledum palustre subsp. longifolium, commonly known as long-leaved Labrador tea, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical *Ledum palustre*. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its roots and leaves contain aromatic compounds, including phenolic acids and volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and ecological significance. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas."
