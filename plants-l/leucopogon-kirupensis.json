    "intro": "Leucopogon kirupensis, commonly known as the Kirupan heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
