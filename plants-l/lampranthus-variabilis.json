It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its striking appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
