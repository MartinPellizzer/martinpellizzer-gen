    "intro": "Leymus mongolicus, commonly known as Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating resilience to drought and grazing. Leymus mongolicus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting grazing wildlife in its native range."
