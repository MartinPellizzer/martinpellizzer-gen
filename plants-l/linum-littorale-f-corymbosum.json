It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in moist, saline environments along shorelines. Its fibrous stalks were historically used for making textiles and paper. Linum littorale f. corymbosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
