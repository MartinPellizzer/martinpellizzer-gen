    "intro": "Lomandra longifolia subsp. exilis, commonly known as the slender leaved lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
