    "intro": "Liriosma tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui liriosma, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Marantaceae, which includes a variety of ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage, which can vary in shape and texture depending on the environment. It thrives in high-altitude, humid conditions and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the tepuis. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Liriosma tepuiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
