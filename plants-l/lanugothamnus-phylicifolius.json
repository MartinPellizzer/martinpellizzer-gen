    "intro": "Lanugothamnus phylicifolius, commonly known as the silky thyme, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Lanugothamnus phylicifolius is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic properties."
