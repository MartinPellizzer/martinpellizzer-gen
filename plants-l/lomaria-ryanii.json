    "intro": "Lomaria ryanii, commonly known as the Ryan's lomaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lomaria ryanii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
