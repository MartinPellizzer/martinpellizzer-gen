    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. terana, commonly known as the alpine wood sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with rhizomes that help it establish in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, three-ranked flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color."
