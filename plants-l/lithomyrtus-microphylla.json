It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance. Lithomyrtus microphylla is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
