    "intro": "Lepia stylata, commonly known as the slender lepia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas near water bodies. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
