    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis var. elongata, commonly known as the Canadian lettuce or elongated lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are typically less bitter than those of the standard Lactuca canadensis. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in a loose cluster, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant has been used historically for its edible leaves and has some medicinal properties attributed to its lactucin content."
