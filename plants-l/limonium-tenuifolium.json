    "intro": "Limonium tenuifolium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal plains. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and delicate appearance. Limonium tenuifolium is also valued in horticulture for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its ornamental appeal."
