    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum f. maius, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a fern ally native to South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. This fern ally plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
