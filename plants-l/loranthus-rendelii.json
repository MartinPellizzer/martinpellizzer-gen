    "intro": "Loranthus rendelii, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, and derives its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus rendelii is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
