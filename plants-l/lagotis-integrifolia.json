    "intro": "Lagotis integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf lagotis, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are entire, giving it its scientific name. Its showy, violet-blue flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lagotis integrifolia is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
