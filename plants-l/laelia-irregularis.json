    "intro": "Laelia irregularis, commonly known as the irregular laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude, cool environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Laelia irregularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
