    "intro": "Lasiocroton gutierrezii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with prominent stamens, and its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
