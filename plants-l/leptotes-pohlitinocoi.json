    "intro": "Leptotes pohlitinocoi, commonly known as the Pohlit's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, elongated spur. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
