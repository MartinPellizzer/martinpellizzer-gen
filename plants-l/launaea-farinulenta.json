It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers are arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Launaea farinulenta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
