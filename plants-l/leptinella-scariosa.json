    "intro": "Leptinella scariosa, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Leptinella scariosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
