    "intro": "Linagrostis vulgaris, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Linagrostis vulgaris is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
