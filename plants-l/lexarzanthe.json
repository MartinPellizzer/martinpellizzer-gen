    "intro": "Lexarzanthe, commonly known as the golden flame lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces slender, erect stems that support its vibrant blooms. Lexarzanthe thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
