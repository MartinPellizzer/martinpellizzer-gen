    "intro": "Lecanorchis brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common dispersal method among orchids."
