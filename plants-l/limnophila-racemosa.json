    "intro": "Limnophila racemosa, commonly known as water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, with its roots submerged and its stems and leaves emerging above the water surface. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that are often pink or white in color. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Limnophila racemosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
