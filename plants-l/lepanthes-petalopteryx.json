It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a unique, tumbling growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests.

The orchid's botanical structure includes a short, erect stem with fleshy, lanceolate leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions."
