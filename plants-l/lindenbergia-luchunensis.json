It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
