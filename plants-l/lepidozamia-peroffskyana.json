    "intro": "Lepidozamia peroffskyana, commonly known as the Southern cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a gymnosperm characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a striking addition to subtropical gardens. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in protected environments."
