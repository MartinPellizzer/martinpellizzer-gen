    "intro": "Limonium plumosum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline, coastal habitat. Limonium plumosum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
