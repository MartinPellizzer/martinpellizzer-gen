    "intro": "Lupinus albifrons, commonly known as the white-fronted lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
