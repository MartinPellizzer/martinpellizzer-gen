    "intro": "Lupinus adsurgens, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue or violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus adsurgens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
