    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus f. obtusifolius, commonly known as the obtuse-leaved mountain pea, is a variant of the mountain pea plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically more pronounced than those of the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
