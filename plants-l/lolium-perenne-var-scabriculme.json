It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy forage crop and a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
