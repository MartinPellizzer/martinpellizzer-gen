    "intro": "Lupinus argenteus subsp. moabensis, commonly known as Moab lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its growth habit is typically low to mid-height, with narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Moab lupine plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
