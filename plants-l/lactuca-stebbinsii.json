    "intro": "Lactuca stebbinsii, commonly known as Stebbins' lettuce, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and pale green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
