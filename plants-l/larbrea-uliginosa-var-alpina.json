    "intro": "Larbrea uliginosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bog moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to high-altitude wetlands and peat bogs. It belongs to the family Sphagnaceae and is characterized by its dense, spongy growth habit. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, often forming extensive mats that contribute to soil formation. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Larbrea uliginosa var. alpina plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration and habitat creation for various alpine flora and fauna."
