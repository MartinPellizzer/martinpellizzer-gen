It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in Cyprus."
