    "intro": "Limonium ksamilum, commonly known as the Ksamil sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium ksamilum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
