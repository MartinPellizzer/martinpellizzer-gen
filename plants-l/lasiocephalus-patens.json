    "intro": "Lasiocephalus patens, commonly known as the spreading haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and the presence of long, hair-like structures on its leaf tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth upper surface and a more textured lower surface. Lasiocephalus patens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
