    "intro": "Litobrochia pedata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in regions with limited moisture. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and access nutrients from the surrounding rock. Litobrochia pedata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
