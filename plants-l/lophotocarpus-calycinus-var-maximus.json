    "intro": "Lophotocarpus calycinus var. maximus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf bases, a feature typical of the genus Lophotocarpus. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
