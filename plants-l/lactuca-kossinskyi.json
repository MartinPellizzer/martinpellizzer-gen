    "intro": "Lactuca kossinskyi, commonly known as Kossinsky's lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
