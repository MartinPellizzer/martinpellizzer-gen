    "intro": "Lasiopetalum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with five lobes that are narrow and pointed. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained conditions."
