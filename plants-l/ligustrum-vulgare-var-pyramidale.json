    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. pyramidale, commonly known as the European privet, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, black berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
