    "intro": "Larix decidua var. pendulina, commonly known as the weeping larch, is a rare and striking variant of the European larch. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, typical of the coniferous family. Its needles are slender and deciduous, turning a golden hue before falling in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
