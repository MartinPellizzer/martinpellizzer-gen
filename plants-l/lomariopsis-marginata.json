It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically light green with a pale margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Lomariopsis marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
