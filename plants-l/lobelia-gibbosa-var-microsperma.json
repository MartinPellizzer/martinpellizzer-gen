It features small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy, bell-shaped blooms. This variety is distinguished by its smaller seeds compared to other lobelia species, contributing to its unique botanical classification."
