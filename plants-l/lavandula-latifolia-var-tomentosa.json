It is characterized by its broad, gray-green leaves that are densely covered in a soft, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its aromatic foliage and showy blooms, it is often used in ornamental landscaping and herbal medicine."
