It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are usually clustered along the stems. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts."
