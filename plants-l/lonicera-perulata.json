    "intro": "Lonicera perulata, commonly known as the Perulata honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Lonicera perulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
