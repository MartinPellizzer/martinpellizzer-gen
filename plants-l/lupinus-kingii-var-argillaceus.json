It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or clay soils and is adapted to low rainfall conditions. Its compound leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus kingii var. argillaceus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
