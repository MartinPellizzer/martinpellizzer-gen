    "intro": "Ligularia potaninii, commonly known as the Siberian ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive white to yellowish margin, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
