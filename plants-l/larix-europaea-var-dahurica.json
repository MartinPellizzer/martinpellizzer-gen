    "intro": "Larix europaea var. dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Europe and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soils, contributing to its ecological significance in boreal and subarctic regions."
