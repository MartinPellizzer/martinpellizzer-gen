    "intro": "Lilium lankongense, commonly known as the Lankong lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its bulbs are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, valued for their purported medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lilium lankongense is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
