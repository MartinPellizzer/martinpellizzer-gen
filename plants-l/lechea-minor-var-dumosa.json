    "intro": "Lechea minor var. dumosa, commonly known as the woolly lechea, is a small, low-growing succulent native to arid regions of South America. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to grayish hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to survive in dry conditions."
