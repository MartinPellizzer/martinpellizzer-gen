    "intro": "Lychnis coeli-rosa subvar. subaspera, commonly known as the rough fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its hardy nature and ornamental flowers make it a notable wildflower in its native habitats."
