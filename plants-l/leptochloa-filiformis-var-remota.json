    "intro": "Leptochloa filiformis var. remota, commonly known as the slender lespedeza, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are usually pale green to brown, and the plant is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
