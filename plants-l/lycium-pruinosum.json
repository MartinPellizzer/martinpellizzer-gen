    "intro": "Lycium pruinosum, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Lycium pruinosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
