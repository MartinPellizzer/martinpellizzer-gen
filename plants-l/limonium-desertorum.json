    "intro": "Limonium desertorum, commonly known as desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Limonium desertorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
