    "intro": "Lindera velutina, commonly known as smooth lindera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Lindera velutina is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
