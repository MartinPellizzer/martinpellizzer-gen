It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and saline environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
