    "intro": "Lupinus lepidus var. aridus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue to violet pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is a key component of desert ecosystems."
