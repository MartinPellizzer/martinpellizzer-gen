    "intro": "Lepanthopsis constanzensis, commonly known as the Constanzense orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces raceme-like inflorescences with multiple small, showy flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
