    "intro": "Luzula labradorica, commonly known as Labrador sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as tundra, bogs, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Luzula labradorica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by stabilizing soil and providing food for various herbivores."
