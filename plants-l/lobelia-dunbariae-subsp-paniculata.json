    "intro": "Lobelia dunbariae subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the Hawaiian lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically arranged in dense, paniculate inflorescences. The plant is evergreen, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
