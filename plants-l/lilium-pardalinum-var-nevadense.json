    "intro": "Lilium pardalinum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada tiger lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers with dark red markings, resembling the pattern of a tiger's coat. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in late summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
