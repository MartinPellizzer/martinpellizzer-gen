    "intro": "Lomilis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Lomilis is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
