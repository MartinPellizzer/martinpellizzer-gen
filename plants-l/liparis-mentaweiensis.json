    "intro": "Liparis mentaweiensis, commonly known as the Mentawai orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor. Liparis mentaweiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local biodiversity of its endemic habitat."
