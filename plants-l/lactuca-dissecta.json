    "intro": "Lactuca dissecta, commonly known as the cutleaf lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Lactuca dissecta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
