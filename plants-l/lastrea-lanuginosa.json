    "intro": "Lastrea lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its stems are often branching and can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring and summer months."
