    "intro": "Lilium monadelphum, commonly known as the African lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to regrow each season, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Lilium monadelphum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
