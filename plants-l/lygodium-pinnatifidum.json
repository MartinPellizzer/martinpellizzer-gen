    "intro": "Lygodium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical climbing fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with narrow, elongated segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Lygodium pinnatifidum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
