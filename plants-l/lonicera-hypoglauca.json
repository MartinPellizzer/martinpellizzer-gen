    "intro": "Lonicera hypoglauca, commonly known as the silver honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though not particularly palatable. Lonicera hypoglauca is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
