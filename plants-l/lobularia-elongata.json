    "intro": "Lobularia elongata, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Lobularia elongata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
