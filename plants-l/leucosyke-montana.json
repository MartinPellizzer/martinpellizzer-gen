    "intro": "Leucosyke montana, commonly known as the mountain whitebark, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a fine, silvery pubescence. Leucosyke montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing alpine soils."
