    "intro": "Lonicera italica, commonly known as the Italian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, ripen in the fall and are edible for birds and some mammals. Lonicera italica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
