    "intro": "Lycopodium reflexum var. udum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss family (Lycopodiaceae). It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
