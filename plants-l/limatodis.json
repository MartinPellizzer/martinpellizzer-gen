    "intro": "Limatodis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Limatodis has small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for garden use. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural applications."
