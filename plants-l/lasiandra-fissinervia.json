    "intro": "Lasiandra fissinervia, commonly known as the fissured nerve plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves with prominent venation. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by a strong, aromatic scent. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Lasiandra fissinervia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role."
