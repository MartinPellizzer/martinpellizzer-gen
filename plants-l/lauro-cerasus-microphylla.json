    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or Prunus mume, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, followed by small, edible fruits that are tart and yellowish. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its ornate blossoms and is also valued in traditional medicine. The species is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
