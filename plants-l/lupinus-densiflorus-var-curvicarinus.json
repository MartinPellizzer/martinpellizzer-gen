    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. curvicarinus, commonly known as the narrow-awned lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescences and narrow, curved bracts that give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for native wildlife."
