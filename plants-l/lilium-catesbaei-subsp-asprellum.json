    "intro": "Lilium catesbaei subsp. asprellum, commonly known as the Florida spider lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, white, spider-like flowers with a greenish tinge. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often before the leaves fully emerge. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust and spiky floral structure compared to other members of the *Lilium* genus."
