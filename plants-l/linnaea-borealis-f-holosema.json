    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. holosema, commonly known as the white twinflower, is a rare and elegant plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. This form of Linnaea borealis is distinguished by its fully white flowers, as opposed to the more common pink or red variations."
