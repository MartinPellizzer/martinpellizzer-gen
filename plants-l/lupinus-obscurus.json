    "intro": "Lupinus obscurus, commonly known as the dark lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus obscurus has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is also capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria."
