    "intro": "Lamium incisum var. cryptanthum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of stolons, which allow it to spread and form dense mats. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
