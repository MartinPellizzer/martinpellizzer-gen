It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
