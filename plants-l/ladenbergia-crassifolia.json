    "intro": "Ladenbergia crassifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf legume, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with rough, textured surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
