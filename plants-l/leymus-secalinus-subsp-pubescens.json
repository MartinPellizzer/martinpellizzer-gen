    "intro": "Leymus secalinus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its subspecies name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
