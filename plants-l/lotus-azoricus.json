    "intro": "Lotus azoricus, commonly known as the Azorean lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
