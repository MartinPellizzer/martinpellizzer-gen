    "intro": "Lycopsis vesicaria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its simple, branching stems are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. Lycopsis vesicaria is a carnivorous plant, relying on the captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
