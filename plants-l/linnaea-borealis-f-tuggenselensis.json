    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. tuggenselensis, commonly known as the Tuggenselens ghostflower, is a rare and elusive variant of the twinflower. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces red berries in the fall. This form is distinguished by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
