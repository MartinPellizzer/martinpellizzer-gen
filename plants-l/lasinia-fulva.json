    "intro": "[WRONG START] Lasi\u00f1a fulva, commonly known as the golden lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a bright yellow to orange hue due to the presence of pigments like orcinol and atranorin. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
