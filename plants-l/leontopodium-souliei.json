    "intro": "Leontopodium souliei, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of silvery-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with strong winds. Due to its beauty and symbolism, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in the wild."
