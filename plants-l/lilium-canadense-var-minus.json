    "intro": "Lilium canadense var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf Canada lily, is a variant of the Canada lily native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial to full shade. It is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the typical Canada lily, making it a compact and ornamental addition to gardens. This plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
