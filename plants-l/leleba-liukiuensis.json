It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
