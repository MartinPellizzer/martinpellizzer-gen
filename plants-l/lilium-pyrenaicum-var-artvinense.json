    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum var. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin lily, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
