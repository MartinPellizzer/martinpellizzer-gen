    "intro": "Loxodera strigosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, a common feature among Euphorbiaceae species. Loxodera strigosa is typically herbaceous, growing as an annual or perennial plant depending on the climate."
