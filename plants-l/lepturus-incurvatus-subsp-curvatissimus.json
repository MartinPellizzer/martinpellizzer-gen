    "intro": "Lepturus incurvatus subsp. curvatissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often curved leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
