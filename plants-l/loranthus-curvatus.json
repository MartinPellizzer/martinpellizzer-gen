    "intro": "Loranthus curvatus, commonly known as the curved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive, elongated, and often curved stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, and it produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. This species is found in various regions of Australia and is known for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
