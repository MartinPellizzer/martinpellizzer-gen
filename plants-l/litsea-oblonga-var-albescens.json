    "intro": "Litsea oblonga var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered litsea, is a variant of the litsea oblonga species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The flowers are typically clustered in panicles and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are edible but not commonly cultivated for food. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic foliage."
