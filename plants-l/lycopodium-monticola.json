    "intro": "Lycopodium monticola, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium monticola is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
