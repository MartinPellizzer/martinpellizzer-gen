    "intro": "Leptochilus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves, which help it thrive in moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typical of many orchid species. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to survive in wetland conditions. Leptochilus longissimus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various insects."
