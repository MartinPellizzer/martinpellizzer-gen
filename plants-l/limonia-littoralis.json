    "intro": "Limonia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red throat. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, providing some resistance to salt spray. Limonia littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
