It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the leaves.
