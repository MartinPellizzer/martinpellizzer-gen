    "intro": "Lobivia euanthema, commonly known as the yellow lobivia, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stem and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
