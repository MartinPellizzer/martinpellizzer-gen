    "intro": "Larix kaempferi, commonly known as Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that turn golden in autumn before falling. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release winged seeds in the spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
