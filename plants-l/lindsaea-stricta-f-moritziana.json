    "intro": "Lindsaea stricta f. moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's stiff lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Lindsaeaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender rhizome and dense, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
