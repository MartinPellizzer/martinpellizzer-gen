    "intro": "Loranthus woodii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pink flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Loranthus woodii is native to tropical Africa and is often found in dense forests where its host trees thrive. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in the study of parasitic plant interactions."
