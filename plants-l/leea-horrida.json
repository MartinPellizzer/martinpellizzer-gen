    "intro": "Leea horrida, commonly known as the rough leea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Leea horrida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and coastal areas."
