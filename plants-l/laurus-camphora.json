    "intro": "Laurus camphora, commonly known as the camphor laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant, aromatic flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the camphor-like scent it emits. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
