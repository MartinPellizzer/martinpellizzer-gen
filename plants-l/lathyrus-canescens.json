    "intro": "Lathyrus canescens, commonly known as the hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a legume characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Lathyrus canescens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
