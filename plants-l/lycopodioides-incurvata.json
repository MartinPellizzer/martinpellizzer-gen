    "intro": "Lycopodioides incurvata, commonly known as the curly clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb with spirally arranged, narrow, and often curved leaves. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is characteristic of many primitive vascular plants."
