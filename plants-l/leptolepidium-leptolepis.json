    "intro": "Leptolepidium leptolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact clusters of bright green, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Leptolepidium leptolepis is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, typically flowering in late summer."
