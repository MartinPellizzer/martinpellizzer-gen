    "intro": "Lewisia longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers with five petals that are elongated and pointed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Lewisia longipetala is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and cold temperatures, which contributes to its hardiness in alpine environments."
