    "intro": "Libanotis iliensis, commonly known as the Ili Valley bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
