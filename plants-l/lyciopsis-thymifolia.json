    "intro": "Lyciopsis thymifolia, commonly known as coastal buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Lyciopsis thymifolia is adapted to salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
