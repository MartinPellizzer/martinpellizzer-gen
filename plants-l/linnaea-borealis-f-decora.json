It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its delicate, twin-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred shape that aids in pollination by insects.
