    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. tomentosulum, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, reddish-orange berries that are edible but often bitter. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions."
