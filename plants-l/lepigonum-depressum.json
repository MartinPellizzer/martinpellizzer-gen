    "intro": "Lepigonum depressum, commonly known as the low-growing lepigonum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Lepigonum depressum is valued in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in woodland conditions."
