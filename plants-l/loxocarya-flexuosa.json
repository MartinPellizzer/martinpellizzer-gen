    "intro": "Loxocarya flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense, compact formations. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. Loxocarya flexuosa is native to parts of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments."
