    "intro": "Lunathyrium pseudoconilii var. subdeltoidofrons, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
