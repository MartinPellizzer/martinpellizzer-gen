    "intro": "Lupinus microphyllus var. argyreius, commonly known as the silver lupin, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pea-like blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods and rocky areas. The silver lupin is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
