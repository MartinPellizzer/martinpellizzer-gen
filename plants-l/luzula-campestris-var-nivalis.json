    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a dense, tufted growth habit. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white spikelets that are often concealed among the foliage. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
