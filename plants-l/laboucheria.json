    "intro": "Laboucheria, commonly known as the coral tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous clusters of bright orange or red flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Laboucheria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often growing in woodland or along stream banks. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
