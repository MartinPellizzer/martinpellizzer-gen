    "intro": "Lantana lindmanii, commonly known as the Hawaiian lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Lantana lindmanii thrives in full sun and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
