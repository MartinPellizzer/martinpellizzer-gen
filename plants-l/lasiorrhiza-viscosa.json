    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza viscosa, commonly known as the sticky lasion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
