    "intro": "Lepanthes iricolor, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking pink or purple floral spikes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along streams. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, truss-like cluster, with each bloom featuring three petals and three sepals. Lepanthes iricolor is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it sensitive to environmental changes."
