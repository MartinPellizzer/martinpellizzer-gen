    "intro": "Lemna eleanorae, commonly known as the Eleanor's duckweed, is a small, floating aquatic plant belonging to the Lemnaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new fronds forming from the nodes of the parent plant. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can quickly colonize new areas, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
