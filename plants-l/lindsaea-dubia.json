    "intro": "Lindsaea dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear translucent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its leaves. Lindsaea dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
