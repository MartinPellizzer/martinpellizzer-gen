    "intro": "Leptocladodia sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator of air quality."
