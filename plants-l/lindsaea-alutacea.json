    "intro": "Lindsaea alutacea, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea alutacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
