    "intro": "Lonicera nubigena, commonly known as the cloud vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to China. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in loose panicles and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lonicera nubigena is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
