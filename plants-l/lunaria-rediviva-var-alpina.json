    "intro": "Lunaria rediviva var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine moonflower, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded, papery pods that turn a striking blue or violet hue when mature, resembling tiny moons. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in early summer, and it is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
