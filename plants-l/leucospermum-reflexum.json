    "intro": "Leucospermum reflexum, commonly known as the mountain candle bush, is a South African native shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, cone-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Leucospermum reflexum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
