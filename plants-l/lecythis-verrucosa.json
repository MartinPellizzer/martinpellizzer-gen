    "intro": "Lecythis verrucosa, commonly known as the rubber tree or Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its latex, once a major source of natural rubber, is harvested from the bark. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and has historical significance in the rubber industry."
