    "intro": "Loranthus koumensis, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a short flowering period in the spring. Loranthus koumensis is native to China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
