    "intro": "Lycopodium confertum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a low, compact mat. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium confertum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
