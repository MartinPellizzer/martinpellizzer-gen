    "intro": "Lonicera serotina, commonly known as lateflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of yellow and orange. Its berries are red or orange and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Lonicera serotina is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
