    "intro": "Lobivia rowleyi var. rubraurantiaca, commonly known as the Red-Orange Lobivia, is a compact, branching cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features small, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color, with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
