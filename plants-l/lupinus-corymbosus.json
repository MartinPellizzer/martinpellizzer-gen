    "intro": "Lupinus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus corymbosus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
