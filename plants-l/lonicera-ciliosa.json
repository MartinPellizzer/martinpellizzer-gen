    "intro": "Lonicera ciliosa, commonly known as the silky honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall. Lonicera ciliosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
