    "intro": "Lotodes stachydis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Lotodes, is a aquatic plant native to certain regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a showy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and beetles. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
