    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria subvar. glabricaule, commonly known as smooth willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, glabrous (smooth) stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces spikes of pale pink to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
