It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white powder. It is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
