    "intro": "Ladenbergia epiphytica, commonly known as the climbing legume, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a woody stem that can climb using adventitious roots, and its leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound. Ladenbergia epiphytica produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
