It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing vibrant purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lagotis minor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats."
