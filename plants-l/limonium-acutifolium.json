    "intro": "Limonium acutifolium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to coastal habitats. Limonium acutifolium is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and floral arrangements."
