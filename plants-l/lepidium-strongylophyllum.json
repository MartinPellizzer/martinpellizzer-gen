    "intro": "Lepidium strongylophyllum, commonly known as the coastal rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, cylindrical fruits called siliques, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Lepidium strongylophyllum is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
