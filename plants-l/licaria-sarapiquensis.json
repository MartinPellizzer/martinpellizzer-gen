    "intro": "Licaria sarapiquensis, commonly known as the Sarapiqu\u00ed licaria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, Licaria sarapiquensis is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest for both ecological and botanical research."
