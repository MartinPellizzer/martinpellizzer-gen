    "intro": "Lampranthus perspicuus, commonly known as the rainbow flower, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Lampranthus perspicuus is known for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
