It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine due to their purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, it is also noted for its slow growth and limited hardiness in cooler climates."
