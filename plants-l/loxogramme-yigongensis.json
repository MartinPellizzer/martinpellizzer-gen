    "intro": "Loxogramme yigongensis, commonly known as the Yigong water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Loxogramme yigongensis is considered an endangered species."
