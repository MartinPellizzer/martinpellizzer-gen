    "intro": "Lonicera maackii var. maackii, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb by twining around supports. Its berries, which are dark red to black, are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This species is often invasive in North America, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
