    "intro": "Linaria juncea, commonly known as slender toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, resembling those of the common toadflax. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Linaria juncea is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
