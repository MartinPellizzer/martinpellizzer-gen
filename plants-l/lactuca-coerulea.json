    "intro": "Lactuca coerulea, commonly known as blue lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, spoon-shaped leaves and its pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Lactuca coerulea is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
