    "intro": "Lotus dendroideus var. veatchii, commonly known as the Veatch's tree lotus, is a rare and distinctive member of the legume family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its woody, tree-like structure, with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique, showy appearance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
