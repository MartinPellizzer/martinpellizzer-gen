    "intro": "Laguncularia coccinea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline water, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by woody fruits that contain single, smooth seeds. Laguncularia coccinea plays a vital role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
