It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
