    "intro": "Loricaria complanata, commonly known as the flat-tailed catfish, is a species of catfish native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its flattened body and distinctive, scaleless skin that provides it with a unique appearance. This plant-like aquatic creature is often found in slow-moving waters and is known for its ability to survive in low-oxygen environments. Its botanical relevance is minimal as it is an animal rather than a plant. I can't reply."
