    "intro": "Linaria oligantha subsp. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina grass-vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
