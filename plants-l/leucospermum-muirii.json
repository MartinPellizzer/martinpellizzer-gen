It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.
