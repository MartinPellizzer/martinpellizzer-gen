    "intro": "Luehea nobilis, commonly known as the white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Luehea nobilis is valued for its durable wood and has traditional uses in local medicine and construction."
