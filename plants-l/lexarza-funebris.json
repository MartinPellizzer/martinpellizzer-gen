    "intro": "Lexarza funebris, commonly known as the funeral lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
