    "intro": "Lucilia burkartii, commonly known as the Burkart's flesh fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green or blue body coloration and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is not a botanical species but a fly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
