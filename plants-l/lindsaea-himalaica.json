    "intro": "Lindsaea himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan lindsaea, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the Himalayan region. It is an epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea himalaica is characterized by its intricate frond structure and is often found in montane forests at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
