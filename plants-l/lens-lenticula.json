    "intro": "Lens lenticula, commonly known as the \"lens-shaped lichen,\" is a small, crust-like lichen that grows on rock surfaces in arid environments. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus that often forms a lens-shaped structure. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic association with algae for photosynthesis. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as deserts and rocky slopes. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
