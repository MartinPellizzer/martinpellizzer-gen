    "intro": "Lepisorus pseudoussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance."
