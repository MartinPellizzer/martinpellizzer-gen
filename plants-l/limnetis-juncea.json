    "intro": "Limnetis juncea, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, velvety, waxy leaves that are usually green or reddish in color, with a distinctive rosette shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting water quality and native plant life."
