    "intro": "Leptospermum petraeum, commonly known as the rock bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils in its natural habitat."
