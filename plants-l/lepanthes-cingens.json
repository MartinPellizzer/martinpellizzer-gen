    "intro": "Lepanthes cingens, commonly known as the Crimson Lip Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a bright red lip and yellow petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes cingens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
