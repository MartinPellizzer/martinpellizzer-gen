    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum f. pseudoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a rare and low-growing fern ally native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a dense, mat-forming structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
