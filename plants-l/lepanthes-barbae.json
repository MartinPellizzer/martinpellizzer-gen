    "intro": "Lepanthes barbae, commonly known as the Barbae Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Lepanthes barbae has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
