It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and striking white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a heavy, oily fruit with a hard, woody shell containing edible seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in South American folk medicine. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse rainforest biodiversity."
