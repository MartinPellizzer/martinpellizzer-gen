    "intro": "Logania spermacocea, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through a mechanism involving a spiral twist, aiding in wind dispersal."
