    "intro": "Loxogramme chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Salviniales and is characterized by its floating, delicate fronds that resemble a water lily. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Loxogramme chinensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
