    "intro": "Lupinus prunophilus, commonly known as the cherry blossom lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking purple or pink pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Lupinus prunophilus plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plant species."
