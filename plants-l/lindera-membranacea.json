    "intro": "Lindera membranacea, commonly known as narrowleaf sandcherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features opposite, narrow, ovate leaves with smooth margins and a slightly pubescent underside. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
