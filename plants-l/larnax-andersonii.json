    "intro": "Larnax andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's larnax, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the delicate floral display. Due to habitat loss, Larnax andersonii is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural areas."
