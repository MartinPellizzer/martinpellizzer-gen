    "intro": "Lycaste parvula, commonly known as the miniature lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is a compact plant with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette. Lycaste parvula is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in suitable growing conditions."
