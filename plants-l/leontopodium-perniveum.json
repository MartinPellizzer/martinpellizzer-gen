    "intro": "Leontopodium perniveum, commonly known as the white edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. It is often found in rocky slopes and meadows at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions to prevent overharvesting."
