It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
