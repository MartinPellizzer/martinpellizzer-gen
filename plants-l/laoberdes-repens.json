It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Laoberdes repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
