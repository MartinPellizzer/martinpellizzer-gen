It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its roots are rich in secondary metabolites. Lithospermum cuzcoense is often found growing in rocky or dry soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
