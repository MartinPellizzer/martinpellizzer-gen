    "intro": "Lupinus grayi, commonly known as the Gray's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus grayi is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
