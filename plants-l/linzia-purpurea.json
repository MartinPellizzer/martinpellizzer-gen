    "intro": "Linzia purpurea, commonly known as the purple linseed plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval seeds that are often used as a source of oil, similar to flaxseeds. Linzia purpurea typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
