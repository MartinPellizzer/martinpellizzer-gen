It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet prairies, marshes, and woodland edges, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are sturdy and often branched.
