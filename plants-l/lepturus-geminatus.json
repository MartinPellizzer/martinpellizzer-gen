    "intro": "Lepturus geminatus, commonly known as the twinleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two symmetrical halves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous clusters of small, lanceolate leaves. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
