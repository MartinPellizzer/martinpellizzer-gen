    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba var. obtusiloba, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted and emit a spicy scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor. Its aromatic foliage and unique berries make it a distinctive addition to woodland gardens."
