    "intro": "Leptospermum micromyrtus, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune and coastal heathland environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
