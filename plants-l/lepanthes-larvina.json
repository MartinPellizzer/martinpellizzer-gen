    "intro": "Lepanthes larvina, commonly known as the larvina orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, allowing it to capture light efficiently in its shaded habitat. Lepanthes larvina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
