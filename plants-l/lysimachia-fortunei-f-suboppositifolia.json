    "intro": "Lysimachia fortunei f. suboppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf yellow sorrel, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or ovate, with a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, decorative ground cover."
