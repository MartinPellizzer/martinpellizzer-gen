    "intro": "Leucadendron rodolentum, commonly known as the silver crown, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and its most notable feature: its fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Leucadendron rodolentum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
