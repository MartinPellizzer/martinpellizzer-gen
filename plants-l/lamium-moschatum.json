    "intro": "Lamium moschatum, commonly known as sweetroot or lamium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium moschatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
