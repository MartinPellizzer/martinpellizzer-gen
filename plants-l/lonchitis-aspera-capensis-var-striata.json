    "intro": "Lonchitis-aspera capensis var. striata, commonly known as the African grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
