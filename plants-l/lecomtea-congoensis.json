    "intro": "Lecomtea congoensis, commonly known as the Congo lecomtea, is a rare and understudied plant species native to the dense rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation. Further botanical research is needed to fully understand its ecological role and conservation status."
