    "intro": "Luzula multiflora var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its cold-hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
