    "intro": "Lobelia ruderalis, commonly known as the common lobelia, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in urban areas. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Lobelia ruderalis is often considered a weed but has ornamental value and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
