    "intro": "Leptochloa filiformis var. humilior, commonly known as the slender grass or dwarf leptochloa, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, with a grassy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common but often overlooked component of grassland ecosystems."
