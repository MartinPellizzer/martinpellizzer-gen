    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. pauciflora, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are typically spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the genus Linaria. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
