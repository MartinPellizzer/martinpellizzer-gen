    "intro": "Lobelia organensis, commonly known as the Organ Mountains lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia organensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
