    "intro": "Livistona decipiens var. polyantha, commonly known as the pink fan palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant pink or red when young, gradually maturing to a deep green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
