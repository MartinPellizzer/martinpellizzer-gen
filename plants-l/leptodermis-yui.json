    "intro": "Leptodermis yui, commonly known as the Yui's staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that form a rosette structure, providing a habitat for small organisms. The plant produces a single, fleshy, spore-bearing structure called a sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Leptodermis yui is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical rainforests."
