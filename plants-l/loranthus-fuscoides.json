    "intro": "Loranthus fuscoides, commonly known as the dark mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalyptus and acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
