    "intro": "Lonchitis hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
