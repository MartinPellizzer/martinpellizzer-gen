    "intro": "Lepironia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, globe-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in marshy or wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are arrowhead-shaped and often have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of the plant."
