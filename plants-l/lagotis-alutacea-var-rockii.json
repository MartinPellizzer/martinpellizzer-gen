    "intro": "Lagotis alutacea var. rockii, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
