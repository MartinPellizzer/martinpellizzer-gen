    "intro": "Lippia lepida, commonly known as Mexican mint or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, and it produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Lippia lepida is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
