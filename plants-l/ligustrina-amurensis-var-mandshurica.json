    "intro": "Ligustrina amurensis var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Amur honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red berries that attract birds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 3 meters tall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
