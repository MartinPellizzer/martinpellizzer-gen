    "intro": "Lycopodioides phillipsiana, commonly known as the New Zealand spore-moss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. It has a unique reproductive system that relies on spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
