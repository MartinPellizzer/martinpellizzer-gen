    "intro": "Lycopodiella benjaminiana, commonly known as Benjamin's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
