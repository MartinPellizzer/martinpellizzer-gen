    "intro": "Lepechinia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
