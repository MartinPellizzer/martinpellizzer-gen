    "intro": "Lachnorhiza piloselloides subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lachnorhiza, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in early summer. It is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a characteristic species of certain ecological habitats."
