    "intro": "Loranthus cupulatus var. mayombensis, commonly known as the Mayombensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, fleshy cones. Its berries are often red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree health and providing food for various wildlife."
