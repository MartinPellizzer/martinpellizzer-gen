    "intro": "Linaria supina subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers clustered in racemes. The species is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it survive in dry, rocky habitats. It thrives in full sun and is often found in open, sunny areas such as slopes and gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant within its range."
