    "intro": "Lindsaea decomposita f. simplex, commonly known as the simple lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
