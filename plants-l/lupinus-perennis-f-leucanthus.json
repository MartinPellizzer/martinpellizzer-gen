    "intro": "Lupinus perennis f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered lupine, is a variant of the perennial lupine native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive white or pale blue flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or red hues of the species. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces erect, sparsely branched flower clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for native gardens and restoration projects. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
