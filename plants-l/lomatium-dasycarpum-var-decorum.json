    "intro": "Lomatium dasycarpum var. decorum, commonly known as the Decorum Lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in small, hairy fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
