    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. glaucohirta, commonly known as the blue mist honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in autumn. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. It is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
