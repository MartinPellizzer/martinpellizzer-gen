    "intro": "Lychnidia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their small, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Lychnidia species typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in humid, shaded environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations to their specific habitats."
