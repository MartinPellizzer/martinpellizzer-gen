    "intro": "Luciola sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic firefly, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Lampyridae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found in regions such as the Sudetes mountain range. The plant aspect of this species refers to its bioluminescent larvae, which emit a characteristic greenish light. The larvae are often found in moist habitats like meadows and forests, where they feed on snails and slugs. This species plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat through its predatory behavior and bioluminescence."
