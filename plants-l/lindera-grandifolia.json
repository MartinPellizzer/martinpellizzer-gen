    "intro": "Lindera grandifolia, commonly known as sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. These flowers give way to small, orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, spicy flavor. Lindera grandifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
