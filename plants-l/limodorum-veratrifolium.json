    "intro": "Limodorum veratrifolium, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
