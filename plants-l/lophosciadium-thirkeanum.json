    "intro": "Lophosciadium thirkeanum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and has alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
