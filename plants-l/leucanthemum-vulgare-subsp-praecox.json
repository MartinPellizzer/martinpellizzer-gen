It is characterized by its white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc floret, giving it a daisy-like appearance. This perennial herb typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers from late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also a food source for various pollinators."
