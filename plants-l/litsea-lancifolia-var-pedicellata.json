It is characterized by its aromatic, ovate leaves that emit a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, smooth fruits with a thin, leathery skin. Its botanical features make it valuable in both ornamental horticulture and traditional medicine. The varietal form pedicellata distinguishes it by its pedicellate (stemmed) flowers, which are unique to this variant."
