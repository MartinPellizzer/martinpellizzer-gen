    "intro": "Lobelia hispida, commonly known as rough lobelia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lobelia hispida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
