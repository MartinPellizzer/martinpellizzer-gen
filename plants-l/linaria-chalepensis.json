It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Linaria chalepensis is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
