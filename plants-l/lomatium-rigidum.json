It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Lomatium rigidum thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
