It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used for medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in dry, savannah-like environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is sometimes cultivated for its durable timber and traditional uses."
