    "intro": "Leucorchis micradenia, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
