    "intro": "Lyonia leonis, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lyonia leonis thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
