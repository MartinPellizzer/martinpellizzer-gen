It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, white or yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
