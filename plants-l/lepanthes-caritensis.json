    "intro": "Lepanthes caritensis, commonly known as the Carite's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes caritensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure."
