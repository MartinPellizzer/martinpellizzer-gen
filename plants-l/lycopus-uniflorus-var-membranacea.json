    "intro": "Lycopus uniflorus var. membranacea, commonly known as blueweed or narrow-leaved water-hyssop, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in wet or moist environments. This species is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
