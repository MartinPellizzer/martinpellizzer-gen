    "intro": "Lilium makinoi, commonly known as the Makino lily, is a rare and delicate species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky slopes. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a unique floral element to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
