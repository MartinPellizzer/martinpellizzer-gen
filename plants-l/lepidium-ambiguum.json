    "intro": "Lepidium ambiguum, commonly known as wild cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, edible leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and near water sources. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive siliqua, a type of dry fruit that splits open to release the seeds. Lepidium ambiguum is also known for its peppery flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some culinary and medicinal applications."
