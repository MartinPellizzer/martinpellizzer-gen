    "intro": "Ligeophila sumacoensis, commonly known as the Sumaco lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found growing on bark and rocks in humid tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
