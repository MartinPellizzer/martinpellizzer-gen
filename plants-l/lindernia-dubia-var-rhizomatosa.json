    "intro": "Lindernia dubia var. rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping lindernia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil."
