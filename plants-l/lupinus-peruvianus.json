    "intro": "Lupinus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source by local communities. Its deep root system helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts. Lupinus peruvianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
