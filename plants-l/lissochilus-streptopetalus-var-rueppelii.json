    "intro": "Lissochilus streptopetalus var. rueppelii, commonly known as the Rueppel's orchid, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
