    "intro": "Listrostachys clandestina, commonly known as the hidden-stem dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
