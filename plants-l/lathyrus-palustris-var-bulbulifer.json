    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris var. bulbulifer, commonly known as the marsh vetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation."
