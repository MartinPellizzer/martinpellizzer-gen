    "intro": "Lobelia dressleri, commonly known as the Saddleback Lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lobelia dressleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
