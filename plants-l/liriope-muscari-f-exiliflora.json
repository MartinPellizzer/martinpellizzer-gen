    "intro": "Liriope muscari f. exiliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered martagon lily, is a compact, clump-forming perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, lavender-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a versatile ground cover."
