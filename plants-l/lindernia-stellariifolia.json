    "intro": "Lindernia stellariifolia, commonly known as star-leaved lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Lindernia stellariifolia is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
