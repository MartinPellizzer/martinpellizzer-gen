    "intro": "Lophostemon grandiflorus subsp. riparius, commonly known as the river paperbark, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green and grey, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
