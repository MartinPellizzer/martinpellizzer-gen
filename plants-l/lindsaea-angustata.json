    "intro": "Lindsaea angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, spadix-like flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves. Its leaves are long, narrow, and sometimes have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Lindsaea angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
