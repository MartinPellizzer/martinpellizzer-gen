    "intro": "Lotus involucratus, commonly known as the white lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features striking white flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The white lotus is also valued in traditional medicine and is considered a symbol of purity and spiritual enlightenment in various cultures."
