    "intro": "Limnorchis dilatata var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the orchid family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems."
