    "intro": "Leptocionium braunii, commonly known as the Braun's bladder wort, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Leptocionium braunii is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid conditions."
