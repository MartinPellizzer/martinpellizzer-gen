    "intro": "Lotus varians, commonly known as the variable water-lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that typically open in the early morning and close at dusk. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while its stems are long and flexible. Lotus varians plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
