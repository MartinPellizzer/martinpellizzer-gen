    "intro": "Lycaste costata, commonly known as the Costate Lycaste, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which bloom during the cooler months. Lycaste costata is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
