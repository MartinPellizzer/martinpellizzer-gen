    "intro": "Loxogramme duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that create a lacy appearance, aiding in water filtration and oxygenation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
