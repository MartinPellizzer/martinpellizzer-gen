    "intro": "Leptostemma punctatum, commonly known as the spotted leatherflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Leptostemma punctatum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
