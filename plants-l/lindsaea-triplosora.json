    "intro": "Lindsaea triplosora, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of fine roots, which help it anchor to tree trunks or branches. The plant's foliage is typically bright green, with a soft texture that makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
