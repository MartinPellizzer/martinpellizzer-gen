    "intro": "Lycopodium flabellatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing cones, which are typically located at the tips of its branching stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte generation dominates its life cycle, with the gametophyte phase being short-lived and dependent on the sporophyte for nutrition. Lycopodium flabellatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
