    "intro": "Lobivia planiceps, commonly known as the flat-headed lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its short, rounded stems and small, spiny leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Lobivia planiceps is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
