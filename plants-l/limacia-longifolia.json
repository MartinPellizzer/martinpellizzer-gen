    "intro": "Limacia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by cylindrical, reddish-brown fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Limacia longifolia is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is often associated with rich, sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the native flora in its habitat."
