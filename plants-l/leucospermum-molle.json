    "intro": "Leucospermum molle, commonly known as the soft pink sugarbush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
