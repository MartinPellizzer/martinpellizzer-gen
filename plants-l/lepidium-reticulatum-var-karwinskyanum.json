It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and stems.
