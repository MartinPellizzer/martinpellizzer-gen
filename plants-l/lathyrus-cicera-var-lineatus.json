It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by elongated, narrow pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
