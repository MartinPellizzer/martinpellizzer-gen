    "intro": "Lycopodium decurrens, commonly known as the running clubmoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce upright, spore-bearing cones called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium decurrens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
