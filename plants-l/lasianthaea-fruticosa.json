    "intro": "Lasianthaea fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Lasianthaea fruticosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
