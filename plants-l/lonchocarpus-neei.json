    "intro": "Lonchocarpus neei, commonly known as the Brazilian strangle vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and can grow up to several meters in length. Due to its rapid growth and ability to smother other vegetation, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
