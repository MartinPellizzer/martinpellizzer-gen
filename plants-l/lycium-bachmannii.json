    "intro": "Lycium bachmannii, commonly known as Bachmann's boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for wildlife but generally considered unpalatable to humans. Lycium bachmannii is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves and deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
