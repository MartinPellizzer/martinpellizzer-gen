    "intro": "Lespedeza prostrata, commonly known as prostrate lespedeza, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Lespedeza prostrata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
