    "intro": "Lomandra glauca subsp. collina, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathland and sand dunes, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal environments."
