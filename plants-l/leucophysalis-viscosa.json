    "intro": "Leucophysalis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky leucophysalis, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the cooler months. Leucophysalis viscosa is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
