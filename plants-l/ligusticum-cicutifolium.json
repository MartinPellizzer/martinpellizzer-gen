    "intro": "Ligusticum cicutifolium, commonly known as Chinese lovage, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a robust, aromatic rhizome and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the cow parsley. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves and roots are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
