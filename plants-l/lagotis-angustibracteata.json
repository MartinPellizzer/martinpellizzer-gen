    "intro": "Lagotis angustibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted lagotis, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in coastal or moist woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution."
