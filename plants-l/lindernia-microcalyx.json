It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
