    "intro": "Lonchocarpus muehlbergianus f. angustifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed serpentine bean, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with the terminal leaflet being notably narrower than the lateral ones. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, particularly serpentine soils, and is often found in rocky, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies related to plant adaptation and soil chemistry."
