    "intro": "Leea sandakanensis, commonly known as the Bornean Leea, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
