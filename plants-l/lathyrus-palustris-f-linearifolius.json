It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. This plant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
