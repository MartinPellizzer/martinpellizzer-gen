    "intro": "Ligusticum alpinum, commonly known as alpine ligusticum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its habitat, it is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate."
