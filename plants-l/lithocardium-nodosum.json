    "intro": "Lithocardium nodosum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces such as rocks and soil. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in harsh environments. Lithocardium nodosum is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution and climate changes."
