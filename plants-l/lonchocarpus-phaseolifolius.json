    "intro": "Lonchocarpus phaseolifolius, commonly known as the green bean tree, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of common beans, and its distinctive, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it a popular choice for ornamental and agricultural purposes. It also has a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
