    "intro": "Lappula drobovii, commonly known as the Drobovii lappia, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, saline soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Lappula drobovii is often found in steppes and semi-desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
