    "intro": "Lomandra glauca subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf leek lily, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to southeastern Australia. It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in colour, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
