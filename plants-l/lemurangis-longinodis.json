    "intro": "Lemurangis longinodis, commonly known as the long-nosed lemurangis, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to vibrant red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and specific species of bees. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that have a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals after consumption. Due to habitat loss, Lemurangis longinodis is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
