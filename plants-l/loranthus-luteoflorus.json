    "intro": "Loranthus luteoflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, but it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
