    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage, which can make it challenging to identify without close examination. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
