    "intro": "Lindsaea werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has creeping stems that produce upright, needle-like leaves, which are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the stems and contain spores. Lindsaea werneri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
