    "intro": "Leobordea longicephala, commonly known as the long-headed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, helmet-like floral structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive hooded shape that aids in pollination by specialized insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
