    "intro": "Larix gmelinii var. olgensis, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a variant of the Siberian larch native to eastern Siberia. It is a deciduous conifer that sheds its needle-like leaves in the fall, making it unique among larch species. The tree has a slender, conical shape with a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This hardy species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in taiga and tundra regions."
