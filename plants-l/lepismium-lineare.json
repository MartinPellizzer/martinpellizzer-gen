    "intro": "Lepismium lineare, commonly known as the slender loranth, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loranthaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on its host for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. Native to tropical regions of South America, it typically grows as a shrub or vine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture."
