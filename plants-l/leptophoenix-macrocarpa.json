It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which eventually develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
