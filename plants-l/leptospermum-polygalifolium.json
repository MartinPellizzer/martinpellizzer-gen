    "intro": "Leptospermum polygalifolium, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. The plant's essential oils have also been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
