    "intro": "Liabum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often followed by distinctive, triangular seed pods. Native to regions in Africa and the Americas, it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
