    "intro": "Leucantha solstitialis, commonly known as the summer snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
