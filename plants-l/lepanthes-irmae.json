    "intro": "Lepanthes irmae, commonly known as the Irma's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant features a short, stocky stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
