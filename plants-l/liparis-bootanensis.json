    "intro": "Liparis bootanensis, commonly known as the Bootan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Liparis bootanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
