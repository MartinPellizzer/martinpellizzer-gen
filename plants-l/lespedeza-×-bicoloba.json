    "intro": "Lespedeza \u00d7 bicoloba, commonly known as the twinflower lespedeza, is a hybrid legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically light green with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
