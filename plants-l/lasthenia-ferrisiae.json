    "intro": "Lasthenia ferrisiae, commonly known as the San Diego aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal scrub and coastal prairie environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
