It is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. Lycopus niger thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
