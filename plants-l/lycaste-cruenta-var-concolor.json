    "intro": "Lycaste cruenta var. concolor, commonly known as the red-flowered lycaste, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a striking yellow lip, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence produces multiple flowers, often blooming in clusters during the warmer months. The varietal form concolor refers to its uniform coloration across the petals and sepals, distinguishing it from other lycaste species."
