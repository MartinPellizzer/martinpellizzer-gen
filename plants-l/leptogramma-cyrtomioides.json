    "intro": "Leptogramma cyrtomioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Leptogramma cyrtomioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
