    "intro": "Lobake, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low-growing herb, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Lobake thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom year-round makes it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
