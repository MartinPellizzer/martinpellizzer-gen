    "intro": "Leucosyke bimensis, commonly known as the two-month lily, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically blooms twice a year, hence its common name, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is adapted to high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
