    "intro": "Limeum sulcatum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender lime tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
