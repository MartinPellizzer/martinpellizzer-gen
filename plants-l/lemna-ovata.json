    "intro": "Lemna ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new shoots forming from the nodes of the stolons. It lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Lemna ovata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
