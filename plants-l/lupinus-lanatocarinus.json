    "intro": "Lupinus lanatocarinus, commonly known as the woolly lupin, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Lupinus lanatocarinus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
