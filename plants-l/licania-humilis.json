    "intro": "Licania humilis, commonly known as the dwarf licania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Licania humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
