    "intro": "Larix himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan larch, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden yellow in the autumn before falling off. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with cold climates. The Himalayan larch plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
