    "intro": "Lilium catesbaei var. longii, commonly known as the long-stemmed Turk's cap lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, supporting showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, bulbous underground storage organs called bulbs, which are essential for its survival and propagation. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a fan shape at the base, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
