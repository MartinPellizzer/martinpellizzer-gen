    "intro": "Linaria vulgaris var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, producing clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers. The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its ability to spread and form dense mats."
