    "intro": "Lantana velutina, commonly known as velvet lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow and red. The plant is often found in open woodlands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas. Lantana velutina has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
