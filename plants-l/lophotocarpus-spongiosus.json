    "intro": "Lophotocarpus spongiosus, commonly known as the spongey bladder fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, spongy fronds that give it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Lophotocarpus spongiosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
