    "intro": "Lycopodium curvifolium, commonly known as the curl-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium curvifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage traces back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
