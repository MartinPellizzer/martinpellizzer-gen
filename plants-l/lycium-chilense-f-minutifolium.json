    "intro": "Lycium chilense f. minutifolium, commonly known as the Chilean boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
