    "intro": "Lathyrus setiger, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and its distinctive hairy stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Lathyrus setiger is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
