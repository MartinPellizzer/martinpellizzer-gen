    "intro": "Lilium jankae, commonly known as the Janka lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces bulbous underground stems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
