    "intro": "Loranthus oliganthus, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain a single seed, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife."
