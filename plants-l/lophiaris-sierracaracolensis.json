    "intro": "Lophiaris sierracaracolensis, commonly known as the Sierra Caracol cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
