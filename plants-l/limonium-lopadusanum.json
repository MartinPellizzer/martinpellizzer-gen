    "intro": "Limonium lopadusanum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium lopadusanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
