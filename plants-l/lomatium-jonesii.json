    "intro": "Lomatium jonesii, commonly known as Jones' lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in moist, shady habitats such as forests and meadows. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with finely divided, aromatic foliage that resembles that of other members of its family. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and appear in late spring to early summer. Lomatium jonesii is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
