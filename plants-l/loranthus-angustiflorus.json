    "intro": "Loranthus angustiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are small, oval, and often have a waxy coating. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals."
