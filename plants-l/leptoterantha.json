    "intro": "Leptoterantha, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care. Leptoterantha species typically prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
