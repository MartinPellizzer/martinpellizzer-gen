It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Licania brittoniana is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
