    "intro": "Lippia stachyoides var. stachyoides, commonly known as silverleaf lippia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its aromatic, small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
