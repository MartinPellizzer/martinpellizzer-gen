    "intro": "Lindsaea feei, commonly known as the pink lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically pink to reddish in color, which distinguish it from other members of the genus. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, with small, clustered roots that help anchor it to the forest floor. Lindsaea feei is often found in lowland and montane rainforests, where it contributes to the lush understory vegetation."
