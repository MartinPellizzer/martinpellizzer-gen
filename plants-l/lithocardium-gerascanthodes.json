    "intro": "Lithocardium gerascanthodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed lithocardium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are reddish in color, giving it its common name. Lithocardium gerascanthodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
