    "intro": "Litsea mollifolia, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or broadleaf litsea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Litsea mollifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
