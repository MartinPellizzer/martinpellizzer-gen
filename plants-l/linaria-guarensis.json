    "intro": "Linaria guarensis, commonly known as the Guarense toadflax, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often arranged in racemes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Linaria guarensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
