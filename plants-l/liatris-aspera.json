    "intro": "Liatris aspera, commonly known as rough blazing star, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spikelike inflorescence composed of numerous small purple to pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. It is often found in prairies, meadows, and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Liatris aspera is also valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
