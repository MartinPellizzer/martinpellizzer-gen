    "intro": "Lastrea cavitensis, commonly known as the cavernous lastrea, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Lastrea cavitensis is often found growing in rocky crevices, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
