    "intro": "Lactuca virosa, commonly known as poison lettuce, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its leaves, which can cause gastrointestinal distress if ingested. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its potential toxicity, it is generally avoided as a food source."
