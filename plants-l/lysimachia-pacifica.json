    "intro": "Lysimachia pacifica, commonly known as Pacific filmywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically features creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Lysimachia pacifica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
