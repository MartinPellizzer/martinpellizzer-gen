    "intro": "Lecocarpus lecocarpoides subsp. lecocarpoides, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and aerial roots that help in oxygen absorption. The plant produces woody, berry-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in respiration. It thrives in coastal areas, including tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its botanical features make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
