    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. rubra, commonly known as red honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, depending on the variety. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It is commonly found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and moist soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
