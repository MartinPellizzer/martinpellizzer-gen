    "intro": "Lactuca sanguinea, commonly known as bloody lettuce, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces small, green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which are followed by small, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Lactuca sanguinea is considered a winter annual, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
