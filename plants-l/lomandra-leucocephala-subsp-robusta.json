    "intro": "Lomandra leucocephala subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust lomandra, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, grass-like tufts. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flower spikes in late winter to early spring, which are clustered at the base of the foliage. It is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is drought tolerant once established. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and inland environments."
