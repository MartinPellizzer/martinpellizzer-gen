    "intro": "Ligusticum waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
