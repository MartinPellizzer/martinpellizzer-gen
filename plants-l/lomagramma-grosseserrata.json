    "intro": "Lomagramma grosseserrata, commonly known as the rough-serrated fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges, which contribute to its common name. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, aiding in water retention. Lomagramma grosseserrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
