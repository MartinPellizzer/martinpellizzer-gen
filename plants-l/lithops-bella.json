    "intro": "Lithops bella, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"living stone,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular-shaped leaves that resemble stones, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. Lithops bella is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
