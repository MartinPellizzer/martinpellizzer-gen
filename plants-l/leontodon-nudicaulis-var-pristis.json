    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis var. pristis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form of Leontodon nudicaulis."
