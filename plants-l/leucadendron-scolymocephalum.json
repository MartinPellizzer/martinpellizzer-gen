    "intro": "Leucadendron scolymocephalum, commonly known as the silver leucadendron, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and cone-shaped flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
