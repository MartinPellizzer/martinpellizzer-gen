    "intro": "Lachnaea capitata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered lachnaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. This variety is noted for its low floral density, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Lachnaea capitata."
