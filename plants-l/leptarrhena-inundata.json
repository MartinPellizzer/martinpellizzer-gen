    "intro": "Leptarrhena inundata, commonly known as the water lily, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that remain buoyant on the water's surface, while its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon. Leptarrhena inundata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
