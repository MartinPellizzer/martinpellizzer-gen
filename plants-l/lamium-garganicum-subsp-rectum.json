    "intro": "Lamium garganicum subsp. rectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, two-lipped, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a common sight in the understory of temperate forests."
