    "intro": "Linum meletonis, commonly known as meadow flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the genus Linum, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their showy blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its slender stems can reach up to 60 cm in height, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linum meletonis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
