    "intro": "Lepanthes pecunialis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers with a white center, resembling a star. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Lepanthes pecunialis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
