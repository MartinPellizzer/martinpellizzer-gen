    "intro": "Lobelia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's lobelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts to survive."
