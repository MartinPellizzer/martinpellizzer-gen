It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Lucinaea klossii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
