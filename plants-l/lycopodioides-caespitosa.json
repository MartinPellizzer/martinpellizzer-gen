    "intro": "Lycopodioides caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Lycopodioides caespitosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
