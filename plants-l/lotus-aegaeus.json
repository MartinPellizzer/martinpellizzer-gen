It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive central boss of stamens, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Lotus aegaeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
