    "intro": "Lepanthes sotoi, commonly known as the Soto's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the highland cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant belongs to the genus Lepanthes, which is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Lepanthes sotoi prefers cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrate to thrive. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
