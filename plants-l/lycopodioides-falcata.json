It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often exhibit a zigzag or sinuous growth pattern. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral along the stem. Its reproductive structures consist of sporangia-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodioides falcata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
