    "intro": "Lycomormium minus, commonly known as the small lycomormium, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, which includes clubmosses and related species. The plant is characterized by its small, slender stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lycomormium minus is considered a conservation concern."
