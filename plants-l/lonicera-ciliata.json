    "intro": "Lonicera ciliata, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically yellow or white, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lonicera ciliata is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ecological benefits to wildlife."
