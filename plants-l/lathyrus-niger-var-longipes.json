    "intro": "Lathyrus niger var. longipes, commonly known as the black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from purple to white, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
