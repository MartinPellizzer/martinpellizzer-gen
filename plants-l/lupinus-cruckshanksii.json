It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus cruckshanksii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
