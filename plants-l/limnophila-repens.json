    "intro": "Limnophila repens, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Pontederiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limnophila repens thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
