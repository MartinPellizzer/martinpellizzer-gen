    "intro": "Lamium striatum, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive purple or reddish underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium striatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its ability to suppress weeds."
