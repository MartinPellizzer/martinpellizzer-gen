    "intro": "Livistona holtzei, commonly known as the Holtze's palm, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
