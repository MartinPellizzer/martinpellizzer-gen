    "intro": "Lilaeopsis andina var. microcarpa, commonly known as the Andean dwarf grass, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine plant ecology."
