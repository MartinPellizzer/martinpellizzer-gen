    "intro": "Ligusticopsis coniifolia, commonly known as the mountain fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are usually pink or white with a distinctive hooded structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
