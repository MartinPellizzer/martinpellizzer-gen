    "intro": "Lerchia salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Lerchia salsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate poor soil conditions."
