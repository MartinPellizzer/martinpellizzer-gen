    "intro": "Lupinus quellomayus, commonly known as the Quechua lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus quellomayus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
