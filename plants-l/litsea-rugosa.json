    "intro": "Litsea rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf litsea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, raised dots, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Litsea rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
