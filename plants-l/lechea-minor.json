    "intro": "Lechea minor, commonly known as the lesser milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Lechea minor typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
