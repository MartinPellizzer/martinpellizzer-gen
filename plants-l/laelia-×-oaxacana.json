It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in varying environmental conditions. Laelia \u00d7 oaxacana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivation."
