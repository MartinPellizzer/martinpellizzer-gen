    "intro": "Leea palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan Leea, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, particularly found in the Palawan region. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
