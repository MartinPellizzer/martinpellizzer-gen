    "intro": "Leptopoda acaulis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features a dense, compact growth habit with a short, thick stem that often lies close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Leptopoda acaulis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in mountainous and coastal regions."
