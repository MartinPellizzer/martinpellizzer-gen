It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and blue, typically blooming in late summer. It is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats, where it tolerates saline and drought conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
