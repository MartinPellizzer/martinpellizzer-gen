    "intro": "Lindenbergia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common lindenbergia, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Lindenbergia serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
