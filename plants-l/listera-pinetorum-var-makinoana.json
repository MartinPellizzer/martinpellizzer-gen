    "intro": "Listera pinetorum var. makinoana, commonly known as the Makino's basket lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors, where it thrives in the dappled light of the understory. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to the woodland setting. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
