    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota f. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved privet, is a variant of the privet shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are slightly smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and adaptability make it suitable for hedges and garden borders."
