    "intro": "Lecointea marcano-bertii, commonly known as the Marcano-Bertii lecointea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories, and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
