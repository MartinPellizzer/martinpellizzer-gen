    "intro": "Lingoum erinaceum, commonly known as the hedgehog lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered in small, rounded lobes that resemble the spines of a hedgehog. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in shaded, moist areas. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of ecosystem health."
