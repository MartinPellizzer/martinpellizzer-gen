    "intro": "Lupinus villosus, commonly known as the hairy lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and disturbed sites. Its seed pods contain several small, edible seeds that are rich in protein. Lupinus villosus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
