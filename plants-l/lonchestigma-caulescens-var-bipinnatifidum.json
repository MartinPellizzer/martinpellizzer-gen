    "intro": "Lonchestigma caulescens var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming stem with small, lanceolate leaves that are deeply divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie or woodland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its finely pinnatifid leaves, which give it a delicate, star-like appearance."
