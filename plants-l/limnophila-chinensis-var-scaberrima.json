    "intro": "Limnophila chinensis var. scaberrima, commonly known as the rough marshplant, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
