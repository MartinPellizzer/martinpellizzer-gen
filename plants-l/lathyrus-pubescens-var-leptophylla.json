    "intro": "Lathyrus pubescens var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf pea, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
