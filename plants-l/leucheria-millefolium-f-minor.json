It features finely dissected, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological gardens and natural habitats."
