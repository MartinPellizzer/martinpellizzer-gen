    "intro": "Limniris fulva, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a vibrant yellow to orange coloration. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom at dawn and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support growth. Limniris fulva plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
