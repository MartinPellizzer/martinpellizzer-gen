    "intro": "Leptomischus hiepii, commonly known as the Hiepii sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Leptomischus hiepii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
