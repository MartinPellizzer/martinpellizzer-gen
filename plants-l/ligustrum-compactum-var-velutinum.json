    "intro": "Ligustrum compactum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
