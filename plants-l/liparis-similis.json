It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network that helps anchor it to its substrate. Liparis similis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
