    "intro": "Liparis rubrotincta, commonly known as the red-stained orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red tinge on the lip, which is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
