    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it a clubmoss appearance. Its sporophylls are arranged in spirals and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in alpine ecosystems."
