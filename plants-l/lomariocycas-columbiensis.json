    "intro": "Lomariocycas columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Colombia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered."
