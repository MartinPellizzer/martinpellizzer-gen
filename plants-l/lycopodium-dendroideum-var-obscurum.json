    "intro": "Lycopodium dendroideum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around its stems, giving it a compact appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the stems and produce spores. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
