    "intro": "Lagarosiphon muscoides var. major, commonly known as the giant water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
