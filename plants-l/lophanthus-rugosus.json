    "intro": "Lophanthus rugosus, commonly known as the rough lophanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in the summer months. Lophanthus rugosus is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
