    "intro": "Linaria alpina var. erecta, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow or orange, forming in racemes and resembling the shape of a toad's mouth, hence its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long blooming period."
