    "intro": "Leucampyx newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to dry conditions with deep root systems. Leucampyx newberryi plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
