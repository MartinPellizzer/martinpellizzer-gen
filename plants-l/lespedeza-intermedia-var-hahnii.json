    "intro": "Lespedeza intermedia var. hahnii, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained soils. It is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and extended blooming period."
