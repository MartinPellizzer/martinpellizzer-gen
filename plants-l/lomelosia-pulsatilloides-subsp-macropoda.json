    "intro": "Lomelosia pulsatilloides subsp. macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaf lomelosia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
