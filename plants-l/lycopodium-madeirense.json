    "intro": "Lycopodium madeirense, commonly known as the Madeira clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Lycopodium madeirense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
