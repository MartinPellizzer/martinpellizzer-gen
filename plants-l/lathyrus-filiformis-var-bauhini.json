It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its slender, climbing stems can reach up to 1 meter in length, and it produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
