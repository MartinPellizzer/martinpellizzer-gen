It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries. It is often used in landscaping for its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum medium can grow up to 15 feet tall and is relatively easy to maintain."
