    "intro": "Limonium devoniense, commonly known as the Devon Forget-me-not, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the sea shore, thriving in saline conditions. Its small, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Limonium devoniense is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
