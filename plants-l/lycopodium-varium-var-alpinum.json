    "intro": "Lycopodium varium var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and features tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in harsh mountainous conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
