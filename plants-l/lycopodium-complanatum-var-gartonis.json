    "intro": "Lycopodium complanatum var. gartonis, commonly known as the Garton's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like, and it produces distinctive strobila (spore cones) that are borne on short, erect branches. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats. This variety is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
