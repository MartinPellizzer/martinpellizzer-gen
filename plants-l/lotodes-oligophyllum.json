    "intro": "Lotodes oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, aiding in buoyancy and light reflection. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Lotodes oligophyllum plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
