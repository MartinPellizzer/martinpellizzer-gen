    "intro": "Lepidoneuron biserratum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a distinctive serrated edge along the margins. Lepidoneuron biserratum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
