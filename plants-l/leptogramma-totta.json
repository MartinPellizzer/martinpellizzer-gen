    "intro": "Leptogramma totta, commonly known as the slender leathery fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
