    "intro": "Lespedeza sessilifolia, commonly known as smallleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, oval leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along streambanks. Lespedeza sessilifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
