    "intro": "Leptorkis parva, commonly known as the small-leaved liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced on the surface of the thallus and aid in vegetative propagation. Leptorkis parva plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
