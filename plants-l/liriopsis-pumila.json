    "intro": "Liriopsis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf liriopes, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a mat of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Liriopsis pumila is often used in woodland gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
