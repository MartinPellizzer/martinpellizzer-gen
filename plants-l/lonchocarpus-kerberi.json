It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, clustered flowers that range from yellow to reddish in color. The plant produces pods containing hard, angular seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
