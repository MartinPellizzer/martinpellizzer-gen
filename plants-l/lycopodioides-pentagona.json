    "intro": "Lycopodioides pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a preference for acidic soils and high humidity."
