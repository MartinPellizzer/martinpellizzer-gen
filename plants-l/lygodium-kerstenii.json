    "intro": "Lygodium kerstenii, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Lygodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments, typically near water bodies in tropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Lygodium kerstenii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
