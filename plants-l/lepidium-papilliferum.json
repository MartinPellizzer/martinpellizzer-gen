    "intro": "Lepidium papilliferum, commonly known as the papillate cress, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its distinctive, papillate (bumpy) seeds. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
