    "intro": "Laelia undulata, commonly known as the undulating laelia, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it prefers cool, bright conditions with moderate humidity. Laelia undulata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
