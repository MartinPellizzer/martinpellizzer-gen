    "intro": "Linum thracicum subsp. thracicum, commonly known as Thrace flax, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
