    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subjugosa, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as boreal forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical Linnaea borealis."
