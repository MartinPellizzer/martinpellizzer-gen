    "intro": "Lotononis rostrata subsp. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotononis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
