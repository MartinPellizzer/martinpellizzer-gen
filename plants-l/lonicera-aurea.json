    "intro": "Lonicera aurea, commonly known as the golden honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its red berries, which appear in the fall, are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lonicera aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
