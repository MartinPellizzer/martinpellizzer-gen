    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. uniflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its aquatic habitat. Its roots system helps stabilize the sediment and improve water quality. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
