It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The leaves are typically evergreen, with a glossy surface and a smooth texture. This variant is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which contrast with the more commonly lobed leaves of other varieties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest understories."
