It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus insignis is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
