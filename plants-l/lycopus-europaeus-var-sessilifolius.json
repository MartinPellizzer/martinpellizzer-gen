    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. sessilifolius, commonly known as European bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
