    "intro": "Leucostegia pseudocystopteris, commonly known as the false bladder fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Leucostegia pseudocystopteris is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns in humid, temperate climates."
