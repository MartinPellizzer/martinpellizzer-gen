    "intro": "Lepanthes verapazensis, commonly known as the Verapaz orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America, particularly found in the tropical regions of Guatemala and Honduras. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes verapazensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts interested in rare orchid species."
