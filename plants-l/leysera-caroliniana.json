    "intro": "Leysera caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina sedge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Leysera caroliniana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
