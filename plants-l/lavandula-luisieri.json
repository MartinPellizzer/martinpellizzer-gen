    "intro": "Lavandula luisieri, commonly known as Luisi lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and aromatic, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lavandula luisieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild fragrance, though it is less commonly used for essential oil extraction compared to other lavender species."
