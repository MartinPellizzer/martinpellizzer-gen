    "intro": "Leptocoryphium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Leptocoryphium has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, non-showy flowers that are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
