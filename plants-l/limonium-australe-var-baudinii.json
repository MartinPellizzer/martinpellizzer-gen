    "intro": "Limonium australe var. baudinii, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. It is often found along shorelines and in dune habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
