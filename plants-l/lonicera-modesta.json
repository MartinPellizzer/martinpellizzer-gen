    "intro": "Lonicera modesta, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant bears red berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
