    "intro": "Linaria multicaulis var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its volcanic habitat. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
