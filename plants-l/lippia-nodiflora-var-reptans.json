    "intro": "Lippia nodiflora var. reptans, commonly known as creeping lippia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vigorously along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, often with a slightly aromatic scent. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its chemical composition."
