    "intro": "Leontopodium vulgare, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow bracts that surround the small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions and well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty. Due to its protected status in many regions, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens rather than harvested from the wild."
