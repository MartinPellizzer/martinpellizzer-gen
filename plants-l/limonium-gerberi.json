    "intro": "Limonium gerberi, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss. Limonium gerberi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
