    "intro": "Lupinus lacus, commonly known as the lake lupin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetland regions of North America. It features erect, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of nodules formed in association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Lupinus lacus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along the edges of lakes and marshes."
