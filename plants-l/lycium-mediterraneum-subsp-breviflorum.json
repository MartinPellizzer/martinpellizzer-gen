    "intro": "Lycium mediterraneum subsp. breviflorum, commonly known as the Mediterranean boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and has small, spiny leaves that are usually covered in a whitish waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
