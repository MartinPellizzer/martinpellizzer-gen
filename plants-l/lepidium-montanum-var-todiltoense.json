    "intro": "Lepidium montanum var. todiltoense, commonly known as the Todiltoense peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in siliques, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
