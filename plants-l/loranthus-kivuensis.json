    "intro": "Loranthus kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Albertine Rift region of East Africa. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily ficus species, through a specialized haustellum that allows it to draw water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Loranthus kivuensis is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
