It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in tropical environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
