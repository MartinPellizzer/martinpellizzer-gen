    "intro": "Lepidium montanum subsp. alyssoides, commonly known as alpine peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and has a low, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
