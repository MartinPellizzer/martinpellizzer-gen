    "intro": "Leocereus paulensis, commonly known as the Paul's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
