    "intro": "Loranthus inaequilaterus, commonly known as the unequal-armed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing as an epiphytic or hemiparasitic component of forest ecosystems."
