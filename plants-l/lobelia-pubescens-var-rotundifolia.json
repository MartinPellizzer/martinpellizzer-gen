It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
