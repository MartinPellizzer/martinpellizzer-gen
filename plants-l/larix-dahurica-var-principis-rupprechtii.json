    "intro": "Larix dahurica var. principis-rupprechtii, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in cold, boreal climates. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are long and slender, turning a striking yellow before falling in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal color changes."
