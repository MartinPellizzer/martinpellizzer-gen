    "intro": "Lepanthes pteropogon, commonly known as the feather-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, intricate flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Lepanthes pteropogon is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
