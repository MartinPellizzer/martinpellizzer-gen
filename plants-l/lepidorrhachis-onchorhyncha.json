It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize shaded areas effectively. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.
