    "intro": "Litsea odorifera, commonly known as the fragrant laurier or Chinese laurier, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Litsea odorifera is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
