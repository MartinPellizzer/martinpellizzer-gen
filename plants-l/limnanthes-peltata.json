    "intro": "Limnanthes peltata, commonly known as the common marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Limnanthes peltata is also valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional foods and herbal remedies."
