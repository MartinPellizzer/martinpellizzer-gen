    "intro": "Ligusticum scothicum, commonly known as the Scottish angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic properties and historical medicinal use. Ligusticum scothicum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
