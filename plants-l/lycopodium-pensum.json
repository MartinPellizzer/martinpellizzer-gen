    "intro": "Lycopodium pensum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and spore-producing cones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Lycopodium pensum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
