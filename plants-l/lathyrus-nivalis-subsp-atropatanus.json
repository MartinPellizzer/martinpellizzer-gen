    "intro": "Lathyrus nivalis subsp. atropatanus, commonly known as the alpine grass pea, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are trifoliate, with narrow, hairy blades, and it produces pods containing several seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds, though it can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
