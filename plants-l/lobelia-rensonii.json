    "intro": "Lobelia rensonii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lobelia rensonii is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained conditions."
