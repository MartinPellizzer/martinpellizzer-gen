    "intro": "Lotus hispidus var. vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
