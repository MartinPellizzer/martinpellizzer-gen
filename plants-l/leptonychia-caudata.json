It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on tree bark in temperate forest environments. The thallus is characterized by its leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower cortex. It has a pale green to yellowish color and often forms dense colonies. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
