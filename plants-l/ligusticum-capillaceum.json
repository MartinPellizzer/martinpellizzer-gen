It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
