    "intro": "Lotus fluminensis, commonly known as the river lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow waters and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of rivers and lakes, helping to stabilize the sediment. Lotus fluminensis is often found in regions with slow-moving or still water, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
