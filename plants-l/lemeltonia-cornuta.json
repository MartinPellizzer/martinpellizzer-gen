    "intro": "Lemeltonia cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features striking, elongated leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its milky sap contains latex, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Lemeltonia cornuta plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting native insect populations."
