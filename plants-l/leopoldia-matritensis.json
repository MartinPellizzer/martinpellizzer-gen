It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats, such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
