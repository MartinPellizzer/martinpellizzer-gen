    "intro": "Lathyrus nivalis subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Its trifoliate leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces elongated pods containing lens-shaped seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
