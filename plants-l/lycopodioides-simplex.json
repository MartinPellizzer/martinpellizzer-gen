    "intro": "Lycopodioides simplex, commonly known as the simple clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stem, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky soils. Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the early evolution of vascular plants."
