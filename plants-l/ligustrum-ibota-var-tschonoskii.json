    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota var. tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii privet, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it suitable for hedges and topiaries."
