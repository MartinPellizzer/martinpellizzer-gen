    "intro": "Lepanthopsis cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Lepanthopsis cucullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
