    "intro": "Linaria virgata var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the plant family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers typically bloom from late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower size compared to the typical Linaria virgata, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
