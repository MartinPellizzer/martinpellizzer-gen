    "intro": "Lysimachia paludosa, commonly known as swamp primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, upright stems that produce clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in its ability to thrive in moist soil conditions. It is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other saturated habitats. Lysimachia paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
