It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, often forming dense clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand saline conditions, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
