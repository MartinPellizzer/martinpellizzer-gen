    "intro": "Leptonychia lokundjensis, commonly known as the Lokundje rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
