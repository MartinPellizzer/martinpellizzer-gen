    "intro": "Limonium californicum, commonly known as the California sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it tolerate coastal conditions. Limonium californicum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
