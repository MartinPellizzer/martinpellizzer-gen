    "intro": "Liparis tunensis, commonly known as the Tunisian lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid native to North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a slender, creeping stem with numerous small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
