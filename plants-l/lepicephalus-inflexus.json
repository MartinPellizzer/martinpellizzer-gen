    "intro": "Lepicephalus inflexus, commonly known as the flexible lepicephalus, is a lesser-known member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in moist, acidic soils of temperate regions. This shrub-like plant features small, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in many areas, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
