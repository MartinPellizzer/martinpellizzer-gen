    "intro": "Lachnorhiza piloselloides subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lachnorhiza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators like bees and flies."
