    "intro": "Loranthus breyeri, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often overlooked. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species is found in parts of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia, where it grows on a variety of host trees."
