    "intro": "Lactuca pusilla, commonly known as dwarf lettuce, is a small annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by slender, cylindrical seeds. It thrives in cool climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its size and appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other lettuce species but is distinct in its botanical features."
