    "intro": "Lomatium leptocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by distinctive, narrow, ribbed fruits. Its foliage is aromatic and often used in traditional herbal medicine by indigenous communities. Lomatium leptocarpum plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
