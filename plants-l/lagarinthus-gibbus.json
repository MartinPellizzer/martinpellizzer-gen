    "intro": "Lagarinthus gibbus, commonly known as the zigzag mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Lagarinthus gibbus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
