    "intro": "Lotoxalis psilotricha, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is covered with a fine, silky layer of fungal hyphae, which gives it its characteristic appearance. The algal component provides photosynthetic capability, while the fungal partner offers protection and nutrient absorption. This symbiotic structure allows Lotoxalis psilotricha to thrive in nutrient-poor environments where other plants may struggle."
