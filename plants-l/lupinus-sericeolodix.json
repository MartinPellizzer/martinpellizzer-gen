    "intro": "Lupinus sericeolodix, commonly known as the silky lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, silky-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lupinus sericeolodix is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
