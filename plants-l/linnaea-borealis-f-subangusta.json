    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subangusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twinflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
