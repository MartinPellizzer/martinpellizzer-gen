    "intro": "Lepidium latifolium f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent narrow-leaved rocket, is a variant of the narrow-leaved wallrocket. It is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its unique foliage and resilience in cooler climates."
