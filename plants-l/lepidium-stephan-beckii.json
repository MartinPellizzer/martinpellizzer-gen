    "intro": "Lepidium stephan-beckii, commonly known as the Andean cress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its edible, peppery leaves that are used in local cuisine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
