    "intro": "Leontodon palustris, commonly known as the marsh hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in elongated clusters during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Leontodon palustris is also a food source for certain pollinators and can be a useful indicator species for wetland health."
