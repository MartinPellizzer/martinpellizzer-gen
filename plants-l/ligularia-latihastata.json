    "intro": "Ligularia latihastata, commonly known as the broad-leaved ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers with distinctive, elongated petals and a prominent central disk. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
