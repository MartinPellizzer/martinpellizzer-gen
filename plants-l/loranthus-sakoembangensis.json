    "intro": "Loranthus sakoembangensis, commonly known as the Sakoembang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host trees."
