    "intro": "Lecanorchis hokurikuensis, commonly known as the Hokuriku orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with specific fungal symbionts. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
