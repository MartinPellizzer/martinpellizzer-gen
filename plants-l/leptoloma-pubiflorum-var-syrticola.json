    "intro": "Leptoloma pubiflorum var. syrticola, commonly known as the Syrticola bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in environments with limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
