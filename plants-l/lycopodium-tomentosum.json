    "intro": "Lycopodium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage with soft, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves. Native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems that produce small, spore-bearing cones at the tips. Lycopodium tomentosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and shaded woodland settings."
