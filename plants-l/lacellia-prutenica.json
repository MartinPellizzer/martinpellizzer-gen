    "intro": "Lacellia prutenica, commonly known as the Prut Valley orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Prut River basin in Romania. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas near streams or springs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a short root system adapted to its specific habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
