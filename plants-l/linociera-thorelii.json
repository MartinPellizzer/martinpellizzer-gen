    "intro": "Linociera thorelii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Linociera thorelii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
