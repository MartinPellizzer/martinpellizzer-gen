    "intro": "Leidesia capensis, commonly known as the Cape leidesia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Leidesia capensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suited to rocky and sandy soils."
