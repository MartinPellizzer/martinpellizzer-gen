    "intro": "Loranthus vulpinus, commonly known as the dogwood dodder, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host trees, primarily members of the Rosaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host plants, affecting their growth and health."
