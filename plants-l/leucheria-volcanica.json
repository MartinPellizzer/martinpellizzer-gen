    "intro": "Leucheria volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic leucheria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor volcanic soils and requires cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
