    "intro": "Luciliocline spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed luciliocline, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
