    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus macrophylla var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or some varieties as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its large, showy, double flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 4\u20138 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that develops after the flowers, though it is not typically edible."
