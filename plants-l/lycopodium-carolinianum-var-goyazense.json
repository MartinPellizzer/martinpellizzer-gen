    "intro": "Lycopodium carolinianum var. goyazense, commonly known as the Goyazense clubmoss, is a rare and specialized member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and a unique morphology that includes narrow, spirally arranged leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, a key feature of its evolutionary history. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
