    "intro": "Lepisorus patungensis, commonly known as the Patungens fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Lepisorus patungensis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
