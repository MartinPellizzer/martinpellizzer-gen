It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often aromatic and slightly menthol-like in scent. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from July to September. It thrives in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it identifiable and useful in ecological and medicinal contexts."
