    "intro": "Lycopodium miniatum, commonly known as the miniature clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Lycopodium miniatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory plant communities."
