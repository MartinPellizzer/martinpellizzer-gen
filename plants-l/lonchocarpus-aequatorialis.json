    "intro": "Lonchocarpus aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian senna, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
