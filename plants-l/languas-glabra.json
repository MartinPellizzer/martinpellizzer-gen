    "intro": "Languas glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf plant, is a herbaceous species characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and lanceolate leaves. The leaves are typically smooth and lack any hairy or glandular structures, giving the plant its name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Languas glabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
