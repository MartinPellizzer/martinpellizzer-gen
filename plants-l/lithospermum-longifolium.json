    "intro": "Lithospermum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved rock pepper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain a red pigment called lithospermic acid, which has been used in traditional medicine. Lithospermum longifolium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
