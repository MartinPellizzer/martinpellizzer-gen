    "intro": "Lipschitziella heteromalla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a small, perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
