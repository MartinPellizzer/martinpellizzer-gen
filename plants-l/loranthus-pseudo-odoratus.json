    "intro": "Loranthus pseudo-odoratus, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive moisture and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
