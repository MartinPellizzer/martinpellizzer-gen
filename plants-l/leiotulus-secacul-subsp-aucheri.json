    "intro": "Leiotulus secacul subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the Aucher's leiotulus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is notable for its delicate structure and is often found in isolated populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
