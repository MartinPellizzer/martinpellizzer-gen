    "intro": "Larnax sachapapa, commonly known as the Andean morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of purple and blue. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds through wind and animals. Larnax sachapapa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
