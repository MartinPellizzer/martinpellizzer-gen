    "intro": "Landolphia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asclepiadaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble buttercups. Many species of Landolphia are climbing vines with woody stems and palmate leaves. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are valued for their ornamental appeal."
