    "intro": "Lobelia pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or boggy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
