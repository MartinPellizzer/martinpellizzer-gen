    "intro": "Liparis flammula, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow or green markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Liparis flammula is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
