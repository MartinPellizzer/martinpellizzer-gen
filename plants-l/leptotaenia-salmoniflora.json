    "intro": "Leptotaenia salmoniflora, commonly known as the salmon-flowered leptotaenia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive salmon-pink hue. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical environments."
