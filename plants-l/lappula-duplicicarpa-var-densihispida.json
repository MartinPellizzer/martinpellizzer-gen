    "intro": "Lappula duplicicarpa var. densihispida, commonly known as the dense-hairy lappula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is native to regions of Central Asia and is adapted to saline and alkaline soils."
