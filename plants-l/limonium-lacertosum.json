    "intro": "Limonium lacertosum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limonium lacertosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal environments."
