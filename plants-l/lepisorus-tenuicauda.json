    "intro": "Lepisorus tenuicauda, commonly known as the slender-tailed fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
