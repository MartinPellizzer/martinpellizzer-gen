    "intro": "Lupinus eanophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. Lupinus eanophyllus is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in prairies and dry grasslands. It is also valued for its ability to improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
