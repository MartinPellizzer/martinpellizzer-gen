It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
