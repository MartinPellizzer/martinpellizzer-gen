    "intro": "Luehea steinbachii, commonly known as the yellow mangabey tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has a relatively slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
