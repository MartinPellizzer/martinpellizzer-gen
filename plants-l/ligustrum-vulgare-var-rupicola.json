    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, oval berries that are edible for birds. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant for coastal and arid environments. Due to its dense growth habit, it is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant in landscaping."
