    "intro": "Lodhra verhuelli, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features large, showy white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often with a subtle pink or purple hue. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Lodhra verhuelli is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
