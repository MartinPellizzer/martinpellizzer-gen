    "intro": "Liparis bicallosa var. hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Japanese island of Hachijo-jima. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a raceme, which bloom during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or along rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
