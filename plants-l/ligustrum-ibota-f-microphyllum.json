    "intro": "Ligustrum ibota f. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used as a hedge or foundation plant in gardens."
