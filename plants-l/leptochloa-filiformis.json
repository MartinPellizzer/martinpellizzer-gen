    "intro": "Leptochloa filiformis, commonly known as slender grass or slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching in some cultures. Leptochloa filiformis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
