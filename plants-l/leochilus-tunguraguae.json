    "intro": "Leochilus tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua leech fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in cloud forests, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leochilus tunguraguae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
