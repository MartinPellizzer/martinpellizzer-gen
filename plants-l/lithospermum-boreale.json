    "intro": "Lithospermum boreale, commonly known as northern lithosperm, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The roots of Lithospermum boreale contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents."
