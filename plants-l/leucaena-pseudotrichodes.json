    "intro": "Leucaena pseudotrichodes, commonly known as the slender leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often hairy, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically yellow or white. It produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and potential for forage, it is sometimes cultivated for agricultural purposes."
