    "intro": "Lindsaea falcata var. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and its pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are often arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with the pinnae being lanceolate to ovate in shape. This variety is distinguished by its sub-rounded leaflets, which give it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form of L. falcata. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it grows epiphytically or on rocky surfaces."
