    "intro": "Lactuca aogashimaensis, commonly known as the Aogashima lettuce, is a rare wild lettuce species native to the Japanese island of Aogashima. It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
