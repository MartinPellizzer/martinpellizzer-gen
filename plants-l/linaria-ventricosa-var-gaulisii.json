    "intro": "Linaria ventricosa var. gaulisii, commonly known as the Gulf Coast toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange to red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
