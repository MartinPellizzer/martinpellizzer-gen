    "intro": "Ligustrum lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, oval berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
