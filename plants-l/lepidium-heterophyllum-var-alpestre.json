    "intro": "Lepidium heterophyllum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Lepidium heterophyllum var. alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and attractive foliage."
