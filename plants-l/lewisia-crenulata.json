    "intro": "Lewisia crenulata, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies."
