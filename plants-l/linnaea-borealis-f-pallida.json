    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. pallida, commonly known as the pale twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The pale twinflower is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
