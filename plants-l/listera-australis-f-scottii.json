    "intro": "Listera australis f. scottii, commonly known as the Scott's violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive glossy texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
