    "intro": "Leptosyne maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with narrow, blue-green leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Leptosyne maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
