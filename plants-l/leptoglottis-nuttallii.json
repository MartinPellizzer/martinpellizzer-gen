    "intro": "Leptoglottis nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Leptoglottis nuttallii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming in late spring or early summer."
