    "intro": "Lychnis viscaria subsp. subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and limited growing seasons."
