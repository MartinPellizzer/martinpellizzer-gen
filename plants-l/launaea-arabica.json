    "intro": "Launaea arabica, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in dry, sandy soils and can withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, appear in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. Launaea arabica is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
