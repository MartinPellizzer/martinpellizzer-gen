    "intro": "Lachemilla aphanoides, commonly known as the ghost moss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense, carpet-like mats. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a velvety appearance and aiding in water retention. It reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny, cup-like structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Lachemilla aphanoides plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
