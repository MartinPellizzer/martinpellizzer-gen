    "intro": "Livistona nasmophila, commonly known as the Nasmophila palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
