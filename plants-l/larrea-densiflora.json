    "intro": "Larrea densiflora, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Larrea densiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
