    "intro": "Lespedeza eriocarpa subvar. polyantha, commonly known as the woolly lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, three-lobed leaves and has a fibrous root system. Lespedeza eriocarpa subvar. polyantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
