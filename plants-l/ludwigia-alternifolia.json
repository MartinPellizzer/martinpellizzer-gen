It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Ludwigia alternifolia is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
