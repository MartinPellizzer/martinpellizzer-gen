    "intro": "Lipochaeta rockii var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
