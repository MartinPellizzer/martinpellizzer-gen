    "intro": "Lepidoseris recognita, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in small, scale-like structures, which contribute to its scientific name. Lepidoseris recognita is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
