    "intro": "Leptecophylla rapae, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Leptecophylla rapae is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
