    "intro": "Liparis pectinifera, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
