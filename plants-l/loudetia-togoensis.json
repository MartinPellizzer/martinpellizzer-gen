It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Loudetia togoensis is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
