    "intro": "Lepicochlea, commonly known as the zigzag snail, is a genus of small, air-breathing land snails belonging to the family Cyclophoridae. These snails are characterized by their elongated, spiral-shaped shells that often have a distinctive zigzag pattern in their apertural lip. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where they feed on decaying plant matter and algae. The shells are usually smooth and range in color from yellowish to reddish-brown, providing camouflage in their natural habitat. Lepicochlea species play a role in nutrient cycling by breaking down organic material, contributing to the health of their ecosystems."
