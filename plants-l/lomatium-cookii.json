    "intro": "Lomatium cookii, commonly known as Cook's lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly in Washington and Oregon. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a fern-like appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-shaped inflorescences. Lomatium cookii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
