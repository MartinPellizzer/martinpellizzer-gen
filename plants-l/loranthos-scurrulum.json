    "intro": "Loranthos scurrulum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like, and it flowers in late spring or early summer. Despite its parasitic nature, Loranthos scurrulum plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and health of its host trees."
