    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum f. decapitatum, commonly known as the decapitated clubmoss, is a rare variant of the common clubmoss. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its compact, branching structure and scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
