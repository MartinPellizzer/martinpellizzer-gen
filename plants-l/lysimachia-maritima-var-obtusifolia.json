    "intro": "Lysimachia maritima var. obtusifolia, commonly known as sea spurge or coastal knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the shoreline. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Small yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. This plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones and salt marshes."
