    "intro": "Linociera ramiflora var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved linociera, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and thick, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne along the branches. Its foliage is adapted to withstand dry conditions, making it a resilient species in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature."
