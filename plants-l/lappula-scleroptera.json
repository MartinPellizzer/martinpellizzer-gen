    "intro": "Lappula scleroptera, commonly known as bladderleaf or bladderthistle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structure, aiding in wind dispersal. Lappula scleroptera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats."
