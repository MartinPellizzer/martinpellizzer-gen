    "intro": "Lotus australis var. angustifoliolus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features a sprawling growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and flowers."
