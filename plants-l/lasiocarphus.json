    "intro": "Lasiocarphus, commonly known as the woolly phlox, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the western United States. The plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give them their common name. They typically produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, often arranged in clusters. Lasiocarphus species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
