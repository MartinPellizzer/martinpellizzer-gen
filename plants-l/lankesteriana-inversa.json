    "intro": "Lankesteriana inversa, commonly known as the Upside-Down Orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in a reverse orientation, with the petals facing downward. The plant has dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its inflorescence typically consists of a single raceme of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Lankesteriana inversa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
