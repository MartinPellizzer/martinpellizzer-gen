    "intro": "Lantana cujabensis var. scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved lantana, is a flowering shrub native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy and rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
