    "intro": "Lilium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish or orange throat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and slender. Lilium pyrenaicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
