    "intro": "Lorandersonia salicina, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is a lichen, which is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. This species is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like growth that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. Lorandersonia salicina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
