    "intro": "Lupinus platyptenus, commonly known as the flatpod lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces flattened, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus platyptenus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
