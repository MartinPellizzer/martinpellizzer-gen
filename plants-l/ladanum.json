    "intro": "Ladanum, commonly known as the gum tree or *Eucalyptus ladanifera*, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and distinctive aromatic gum resin. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and can shed in strips, revealing a mottled pattern beneath. The resin, known as ladanum gum, has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
