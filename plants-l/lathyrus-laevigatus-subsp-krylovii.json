It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The flowers are typically pale purple to pink, arranged in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain ecological contexts. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
