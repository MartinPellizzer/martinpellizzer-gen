    "intro": "Ligusticum politum, commonly known as Chinese lovage, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features aromatic, hollow stems and large, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported digestive and circulatory benefits. Ligusticum politum thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued both for its medicinal properties and ornamental appeal."
