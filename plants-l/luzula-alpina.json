    "intro": "Luzula alpina, commonly known as alpine woodrush, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish or grayish hue due to a waxy coating. Luzula alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
