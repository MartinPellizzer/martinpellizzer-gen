    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. canadense, commonly known as Canadian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Canadian ryegrass is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
