    "intro": "Leptoderris miegei, commonly known as the Miege's staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid tropical environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rainforests of Southeast Asia."
