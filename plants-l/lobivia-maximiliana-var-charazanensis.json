    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana var. charazanensis, commonly known as the Charazanensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by the development of red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to extreme drought conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
