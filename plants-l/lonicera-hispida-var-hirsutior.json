    "intro": "Lonicera hispida var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically yellow or orange, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This species is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
