    "intro": "Lathyrus hookeri var. trichocalyx, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for soil improvement."
