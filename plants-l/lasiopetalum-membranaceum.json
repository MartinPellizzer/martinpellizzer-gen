    "intro": "Lasiopetalum membranaceum, commonly known as the slender-flowered millepora, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
