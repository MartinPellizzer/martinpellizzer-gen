    "intro": "Lobelia aurita, commonly known as the silverleaf lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lobelia aurita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
