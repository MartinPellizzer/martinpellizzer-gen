    "intro": "Lathyrus sylvestris var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in woodland and shrubland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its fibrous roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil health."
