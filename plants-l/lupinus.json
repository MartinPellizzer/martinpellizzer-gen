    "intro": "Lupinus, commonly known as lupine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems, compound leaves, and showy, often blue or purple, pea-like flowers. Lupines are typically found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria. They vary in height from low-growing shrubs to tall annuals or perennials. Lupines are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
