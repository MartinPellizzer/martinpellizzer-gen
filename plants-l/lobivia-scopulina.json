    "intro": "Lobivia scopulina, commonly known as the rock lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the blooming season. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Lobivia scopulina thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
