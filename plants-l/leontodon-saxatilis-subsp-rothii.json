    "intro": "Leontodon saxatilis subsp. rothii, commonly known as the Roth's rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its flowers are followed by elongated, bristly seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
