    "intro": "Lysipomia muscoides subsp. muscoides, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a crustose lichen that forms dense, low-growing mats on rocky surfaces, typically in alpine or arctic environments. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its structure provides insulation and moisture retention, aiding survival in extreme climates. The species is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration and lacks distinct rhizines."
