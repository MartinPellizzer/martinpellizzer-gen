    "intro": "Lavandula spectabilis, commonly known as the Spanish lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features upright, woody stems covered in dense clusters of fragrant, spike-like flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep purple. The plant's leaves are narrow, gray-green, and aromatic, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and showy blooms, it is a popular choice for both garden cultivation and commercial use."
