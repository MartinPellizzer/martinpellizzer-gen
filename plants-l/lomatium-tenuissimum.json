    "intro": "Lomatium tenuissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, and its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels. It produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the carrot family. Lomatium tenuissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
