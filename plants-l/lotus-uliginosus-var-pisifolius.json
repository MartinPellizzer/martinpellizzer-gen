    "intro": "Lotus uliginosus var. pisifolius, commonly known as the swamp lotus or water hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive central throat coloration. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often floating on the water surface, supported by long, spongy petioles. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its stems are soft and flexible. The botanical characteristics of this species make it well-suited for aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
