    "intro": "Lycopodium neopungens, commonly known as the New Zealand clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Lycopodium neopungens is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and has historical significance in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
