    "intro": "Laportea postulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its leaves contain chemicals that can cause skin irritation, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Laportea postulosa is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates."
