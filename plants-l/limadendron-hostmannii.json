    "intro": "Limadendron hostmannii, commonly known as the desert rose or hostmann's limadendron, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Limadendron hostmannii is well-suited to dry climates and requires minimal water once established, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
