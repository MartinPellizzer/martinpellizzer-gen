    "intro": "Lupinus montigenus, commonly known as the mountain lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in well-drained, often rocky soils. Lupinus montigenus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
