    "intro": "Lycopodium myrsinites, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium myrsinites thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
