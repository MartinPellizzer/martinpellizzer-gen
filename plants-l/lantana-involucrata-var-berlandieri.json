    "intro": "Lantana involucrata var. berlandieri, commonly known as Mexican flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
