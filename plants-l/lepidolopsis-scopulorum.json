    "intro": "Lepidolopsis scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on exposed rock surfaces, where it forms a crust-like growth. Its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions makes it an indicator species for environmental stability. The plant's structure and composition reflect its adaptation to extreme climates and minimal moisture."
