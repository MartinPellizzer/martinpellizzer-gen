It features slender, erect stems with alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces spikes of bright blue to violet flowers, which are typical of the lupin genus. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a forage crop."
