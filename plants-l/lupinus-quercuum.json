It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus quercuum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland and open areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
