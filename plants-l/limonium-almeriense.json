    "intro": "Limonium almeriense, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems and a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Limonium almeriense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden designs that mimic natural coastal environments."
