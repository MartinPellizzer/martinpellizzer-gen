    "intro": "Lemna javanica, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the order Alismatales and is characterized by its rosette-like structure of tiny, broad leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually via vegetative propagation, making it highly adaptable. Lemna javanica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
