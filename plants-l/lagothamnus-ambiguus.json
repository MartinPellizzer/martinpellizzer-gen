    "intro": "Lagothamnus ambiguus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
