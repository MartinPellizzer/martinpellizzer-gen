It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides.
