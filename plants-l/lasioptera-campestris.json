    "intro": "Lasioptera campestris, commonly known as the field sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping or as a ground cover in drought-prone areas."
