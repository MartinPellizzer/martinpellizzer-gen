    "intro": "Lathyrus vestitus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. The variety multiflorus is distinguished by its increased floral display compared to the typical form."
