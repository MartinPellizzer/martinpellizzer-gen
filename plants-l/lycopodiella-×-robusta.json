    "intro": "Lycopodiella \u00d7 robusta, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a fern ally that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Lycopodiella cernua and Lycopodiella tamariscina. This plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that form a mat on the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The botanical interest in Lycopodiella \u00d7 robusta lies in its unique morphology and role in studying hybridization in ancient plant lineages."
