    "intro": "Lopezia cornuta, commonly known as the horned lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or blue. Lopezia cornuta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
