    "intro": "Lobostemon caudatus, commonly known as the curlyleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Lobostemon caudatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
