    "intro": "Lobelia cobaltica, commonly known as the cobalt lobe, is a strikingly colorful flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vivid cobalt-blue petals and compact, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Lobelia cobaltica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a container plant."
