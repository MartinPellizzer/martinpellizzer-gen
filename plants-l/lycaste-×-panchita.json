The plant features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, green, and white. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique floral characteristics."
