    "intro": "Lupinus protrusus, commonly known as the spreading lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps fix nitrogen in the soil. Lupinus protrusus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
