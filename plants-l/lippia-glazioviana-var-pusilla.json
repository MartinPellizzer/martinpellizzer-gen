    "intro": "Lippia glazioviana var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf glaziovian lippia, is a compact shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
