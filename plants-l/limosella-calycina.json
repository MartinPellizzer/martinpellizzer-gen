It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. Limosella calycina plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
