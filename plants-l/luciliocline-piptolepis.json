    "intro": "Luciliocline piptolepis, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the spring season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
