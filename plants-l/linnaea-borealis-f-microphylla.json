    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The species is noted for its slow growth and ability to form dense mats, making it an important component of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
