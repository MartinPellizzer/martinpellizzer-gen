    "intro": "Lamprodithyros protensus, commonly known as the golden tailed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange petals, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling the scales of a fish. The plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Its flowers bloom during the late summer months, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
