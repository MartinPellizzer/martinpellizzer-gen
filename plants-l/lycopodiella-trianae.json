    "intro": "Lycopodiella trianae, commonly known as the Triana's clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its production of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spores in clusters, typical of the lycophyte group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lycopodiella trianae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
