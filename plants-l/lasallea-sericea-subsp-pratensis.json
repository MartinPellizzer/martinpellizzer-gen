    "intro": "Lasallea sericea subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the silky lasallea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, silvery-hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many regions."
