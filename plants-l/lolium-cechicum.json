    "intro": "Lolium cechicum, commonly known as Cech's ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
