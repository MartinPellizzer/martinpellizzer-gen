    "intro": "Liparis maboroensis var. bistriata, commonly known as the Bistriate Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with distinctive dark streaks or bands, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
