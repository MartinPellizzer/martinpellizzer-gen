    "intro": "Limnophila stolonifiera, commonly known as the water thyme, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on the water conditions. The plant spreads through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize large areas of still or slow-moving water. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it is often considered a nuisance weed in ponds and lakes."
