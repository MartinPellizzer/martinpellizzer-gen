These plants are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they typically feature showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves of lythrum are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually square or angular.

The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being adapted to wet or marshy environments."
