    "intro": "Lycopodium biformis, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of microphylls, which are simple leaves with a single vein. The plant produces spores in sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, or cone-like structures. Lycopodium biformis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
