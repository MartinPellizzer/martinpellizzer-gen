    "intro": "Ligustrum vulgare var. laurifolium, commonly known as the common privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a hedge due to its adaptability to various soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
