    "intro": "Lomatium lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly in Idaho and Washington, where it thrives in open, dry habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky areas, and its growth is typically slow and persistent. Lomatium lemmonii is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
