    "intro": "Lindleyalis fustifera, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its prop roots that provide structural support and aid in oxygen absorption in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, fleshy berries. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
