    "intro": "Leucopogon glacialis, commonly known as the glacier heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, typically found in tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Leucopogon glacialis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic and alpine species."
