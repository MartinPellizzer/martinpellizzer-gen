    "intro": "Lycaste leucoflavescens, commonly known as the white-flushed lycaste, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a pale yellow to white coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry seasons. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
