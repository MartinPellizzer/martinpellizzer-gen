    "intro": "Loasa furcata, commonly known as the mountain thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Loasa furcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
