    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris f. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that are densely covered with soft, hairy foliage. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and they appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical form of Lathyrus palustris."
