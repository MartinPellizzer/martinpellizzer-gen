It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its robust and fibrous leaves make it suitable for basket weaving and thatching. Licuala lambii thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove areas."
