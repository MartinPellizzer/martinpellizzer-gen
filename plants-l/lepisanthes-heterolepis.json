    "intro": "Lepisanthes heterolepis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and dense, velvety foliage. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Lepisanthes heterolepis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
