It is a flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and unique, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are pale pink to white and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
