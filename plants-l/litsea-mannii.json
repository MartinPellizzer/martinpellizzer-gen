    "intro": "Litsea mannii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed litsea, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves that emit a citrus-like aroma. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Litsea mannii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its aromatic properties make it a valuable species in both horticulture and local herbal practices."
