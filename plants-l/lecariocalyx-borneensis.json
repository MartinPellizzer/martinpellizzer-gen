    "intro": "Lecariocalyx borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield-leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped leaves, which are typically large and glossy, with a unique pattern of veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
