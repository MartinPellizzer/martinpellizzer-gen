    "intro": "Lankesteriana minutissima, commonly known as the miniature flame orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its tiny, brightly colored flowers that resemble miniature flames, typically in shades of red and orange. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
