    "intro": "Lepanthes orolojaensis, commonly known as the Orolaja orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species."
