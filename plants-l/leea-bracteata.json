    "intro": "Leea bracteata, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or waxy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typically borne along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
