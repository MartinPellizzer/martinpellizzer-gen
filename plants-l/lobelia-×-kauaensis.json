    "intro": "Lobelia \u00d7 kauaensis, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi lobelia, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kaua\u02bbi. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as forest understories and streamside areas. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
