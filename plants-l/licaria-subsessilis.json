    "intro": "Licaria subsessilis, commonly known as the Brazilian licorice plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its roots are known to contain compounds similar to those found in traditional licorice, though it is not a true licorice. Licaria subsessilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
