    "intro": "Loxotrema halseyana, commonly known as the Halsey's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its nutritional needs. It is often found growing on rock surfaces in humid, temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
