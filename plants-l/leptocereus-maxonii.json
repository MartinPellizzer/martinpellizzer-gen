    "intro": "Leptocereus maxonii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, slender stem that often branches at the top. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. These flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
