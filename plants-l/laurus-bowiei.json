    "intro": "Laurus bowiei, commonly known as the Bowie laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic leaves that emit a subtle citrus scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Laurus bowiei thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal climates contribute to its significance in local horticulture."
