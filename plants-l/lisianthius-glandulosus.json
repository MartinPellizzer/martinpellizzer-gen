    "intro": "Lisianthius glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky lisianthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores and aid in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid regions. Due to its unique botanical features, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and ecological benefits."
