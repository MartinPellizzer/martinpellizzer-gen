    "intro": "Lycopodium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium prostratum has lance-shaped leaves that are spirally arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This ancient plant is a relic from the Paleozoic era and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat creation for various microorganisms."
