    "intro": "Leersia oryzoides var. patens, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
