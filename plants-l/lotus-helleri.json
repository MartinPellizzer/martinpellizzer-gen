    "intro": "Lotus helleri, commonly known as the water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade on the water's surface, while its showy, fragrant flowers open in the early morning. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the muddy substrate of ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a distinctive cup-shaped structure that holds water. Lotus helleri plays an important ecological role by supporting aquatic life and improving water quality."
