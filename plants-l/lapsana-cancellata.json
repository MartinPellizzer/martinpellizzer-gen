    "intro": "Lapsana cancellata, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has finely divided, silvery-green leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing small yellowish-white blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lapsana cancellata is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and meadows, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
