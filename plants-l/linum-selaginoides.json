    "intro": "Linum selaginoides, commonly known as the rock dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Linum selaginoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
