It is native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color, providing a striking visual contrast. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
