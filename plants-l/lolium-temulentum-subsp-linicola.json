It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become invasive in certain environments."
