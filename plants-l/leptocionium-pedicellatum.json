    "intro": "Leptocionium pedicellatum, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. The species is well-adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
