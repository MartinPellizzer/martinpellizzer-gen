    "intro": "Liparis viridicallus, commonly known as the green-capped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
