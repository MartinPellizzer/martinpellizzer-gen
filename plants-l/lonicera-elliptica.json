    "intro": "Lonicera elliptica, commonly known as the oval honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lonicera elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
