    "intro": "Ligularia porteri, commonly known as the giant cowleaf, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude forests of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, leafless stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for large gardens and wetland landscapes."
