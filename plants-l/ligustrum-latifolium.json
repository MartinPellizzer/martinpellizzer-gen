    "intro": "Ligustrum latifolium, commonly known as the common privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20136 cm long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, drupaceous berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
