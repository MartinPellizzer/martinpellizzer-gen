It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lamarckia is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with heart-shaped leaves. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some areas."
