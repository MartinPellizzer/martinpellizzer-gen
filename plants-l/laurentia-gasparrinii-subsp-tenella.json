    "intro": "Laurentia gasparrinii subsp. tenella, commonly known as the slender laurentia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are pale pink to white, arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and bloom in early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
