    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. submuticum, commonly known as annual ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. It is widely used in forage production and turfgrass mixtures due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
