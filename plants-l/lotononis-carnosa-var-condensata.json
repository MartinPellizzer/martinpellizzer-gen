It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces bright blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
