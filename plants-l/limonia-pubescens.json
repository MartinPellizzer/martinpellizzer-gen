    "intro": "Limonia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn yellow or orange when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Limonia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
