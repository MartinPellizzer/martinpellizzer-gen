It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or woodland habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. This variety is adapted to partial shade and is often found in association with other native wildflowers in its ecosystem."
