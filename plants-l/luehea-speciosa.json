    "intro": "Luehea speciosa, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has small, simple leaves that are typically alternate and have a waxy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. Luehea speciosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
