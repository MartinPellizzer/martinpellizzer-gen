    "intro": "Lavoisiera macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited lavoisiera, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces large, woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lavoisiera macrocarpa is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
