    "intro": "Lathyrus frolowii, commonly known as the Frolow's vetch, is a climbing legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Lathyrus frolowii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
