    "intro": "Lycium biesei, commonly known as the Biesei boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The Biesei boxthorn is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
