    "intro": "Leptospermum flavescens var. minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved tea tree, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies due to its aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal environments."
