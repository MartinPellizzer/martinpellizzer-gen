    "intro": "Lycium arabicum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its small, spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include adapted mechanisms for water conservation, such as thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface area. Lycium arabicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert environments."
