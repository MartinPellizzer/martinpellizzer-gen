    "intro": "Lavandula angustifolia subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lavender, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its compact, narrow leaves and fragrant, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure, thriving in arid and temperate climates. Its essential oils, rich in linalool and lavandin, are widely used in aromatherapy and perfumery. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
