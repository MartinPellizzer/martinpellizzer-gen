    "intro": "Lecythis amapaensis, commonly known as the Amapa lecythium, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in northern Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces a heavy, oily fruit with a thick, woody husk. The fruit contains a sweet, aromatic pulp that is edible and often used in local cuisines. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Lecythis amapaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
