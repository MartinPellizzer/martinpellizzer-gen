    "intro": "Lycopodium ericetorum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, slender shoots that bear small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that enclose the spores, which are released during the spring or early summer. Lycopodium ericetorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
