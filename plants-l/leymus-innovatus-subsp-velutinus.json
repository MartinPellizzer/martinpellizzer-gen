    "intro": "Leymus innovatus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to golden in color. Leymus innovatus subsp. velutinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
