    "intro": "Leontopodium stellatum, commonly known as the star flower or edelweiss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-green foliage and a single, showy yellow flower that resembles a star. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and open meadows. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to the alpine landscape. Due to its beauty and habitat specificity, it is considered a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
