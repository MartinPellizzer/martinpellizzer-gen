    "intro": "Limnochloa mutata, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, forming a dense mat. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Limnochloa mutata plays a role in improving water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life."
