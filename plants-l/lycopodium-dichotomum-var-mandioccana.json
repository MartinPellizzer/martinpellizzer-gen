    "intro": "Lycopodium dichotomum var. mandioccana, commonly known as the Mandiocca clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged spirally along the stems. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporophylls and strobili, are typical of the lycopod group, contributing to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
