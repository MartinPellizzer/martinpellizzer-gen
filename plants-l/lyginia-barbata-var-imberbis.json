    "intro": "Lyginia barbata var. imberbis, commonly known as the smooth arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has heart-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides, distinguishing it from the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
