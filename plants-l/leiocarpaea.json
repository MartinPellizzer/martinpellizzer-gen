    "intro": "Leiocarpaea, commonly known as the golden cup mushroom, is a species of saprophytic fungus found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Phyllopilaceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange cap and slender, often curved stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in clusters on decaying wood, particularly in moist environments. Its spore production occurs in the form of a cup-like structure, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus. Leiocarpaea plays an important role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
