    "intro": "Lycium barbarum var. barbarum, commonly known as Chinese wolfberry or Goji berry, is a shrub native to arid regions of China, Mongolia, and western Asia. It produces small, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants, carotenoids, and various vitamins. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellowish with five petals. The berries are typically harvested when fully ripe, and the plant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties."
