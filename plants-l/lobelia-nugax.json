    "intro": "Lobelia nugax, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
