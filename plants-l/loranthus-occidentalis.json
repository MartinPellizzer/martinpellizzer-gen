    "intro": "Loranthus occidentalis, commonly known as the western mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the western United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant's small, white or greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are often red or yellow, attracting birds that help disperse its seeds. Loranthus occidentalis is a member of the Viscaraceae family and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees like oaks or pines. Its parasitic nature and ecological role in forest ecosystems make it an important but often overlooked plant species."
