    "intro": "Lobelia roughii var. alces, commonly known as the alpine lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
