    "intro": "Lappa arctium, commonly known as greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in a composite inflorescence, followed by spiny, woody fruiting structures called burrs. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Lappa arctium thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in waste areas."
