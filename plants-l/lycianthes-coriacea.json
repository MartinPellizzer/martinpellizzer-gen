It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by egg-shaped, green fruits. Its leaves are often covered in a rough, waxy texture, which gives it its common name.
