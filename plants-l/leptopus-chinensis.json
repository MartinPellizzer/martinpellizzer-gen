    "intro": "Leptopus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Leptopus chinensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
