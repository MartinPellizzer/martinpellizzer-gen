    "intro": "Lactuca laevigata var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf lettuce, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a bedding plant. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic value and its edible leaves."
