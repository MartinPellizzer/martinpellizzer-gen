    "intro": "Leontodon praecox, commonly known as the early thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures, and the plant produces achenes enclosed in a pappus for wind dispersal. Leontodon praecox is often found in open habitats and is known for its resilience to environmental stress."
