    "intro": "Liatris glandulosa, commonly known as the purpletop blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular florets arranged in a composite flower head, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have glandular dots, contributing to its scientific name. Liatris glandulosa is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
