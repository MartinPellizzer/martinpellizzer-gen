    "intro": "Lepironia enodis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly, translucent bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated shape that sets it apart from other orchids. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepironia enodis is considered endangered and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
