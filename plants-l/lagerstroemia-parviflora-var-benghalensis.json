    "intro": "Lagerstroemia parviflora var. benghalensis, commonly known as the Bengal crepe myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers in summer, which are followed by elongated, red or orange seed pods. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and turn yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental bark and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
