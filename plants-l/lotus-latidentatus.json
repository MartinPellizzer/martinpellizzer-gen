    "intro": "Lotus latidentatus, commonly known as the hidden lotus, is a rare and unique member of the legume family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
