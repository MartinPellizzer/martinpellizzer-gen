    "intro": "Luzama aurorae, commonly known as the dawn bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soil at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers open in the early morning, hence its common name, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Luzama aurorae is considered a vulnerable species."
