    "intro": "Liabum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved liabum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
