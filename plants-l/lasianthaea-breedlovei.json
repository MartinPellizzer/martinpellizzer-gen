    "intro": "Lasianthaea breedlovei, commonly known as the Hawaiian lasianthaea, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant is known for its showy, yellow-orange ray florets that contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is often found in the higher elevations of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
