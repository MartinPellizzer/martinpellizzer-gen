    "intro": "Lupinus micranthus var. pachylobus, commonly known as the thick-leaved lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
