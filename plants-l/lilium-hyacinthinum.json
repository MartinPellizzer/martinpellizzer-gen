    "intro": "Lilium hyacinthinum, commonly known as the hyacinth lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa, typically growing in rocky or dry habitats. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are perennial, and the leaves are strap-like, emerging from the base of the plant. The hyacinth lily is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in perfumery and medicine."
