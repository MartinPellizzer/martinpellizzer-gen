    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha subvar. chorrillosensis, commonly known as the Chorrillos lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of southern Peru. It features a ribbed stem with a bluish-gray hue and produces striking violet to purple flowers during the cooler months. The plant has a dense covering of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
