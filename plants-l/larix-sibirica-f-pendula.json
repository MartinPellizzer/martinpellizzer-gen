    "intro": "Larix sibirica f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Siberian larch, is a unique variant of the Siberian larch, characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This cultivar exhibits a distinctive, ornamental appearance with long, pendulous shoots that create a soft, flowing silhouette. Botanically, it retains the needle-like leaves of its parent species, which are typically dark green and needle-shaped. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks."
