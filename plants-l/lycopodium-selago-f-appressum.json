    "intro": "Lycopodium selago f. appressum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of understory vegetation in its habitat."
