    "intro": "Lilium candidum var. purpureostriatum, commonly known as the purple-striated white lily, is a rare and ornamental variant of the white lily. It is characterized by its striking white petals with distinct purple stripes, which add a unique visual appeal. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces large, showy flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
