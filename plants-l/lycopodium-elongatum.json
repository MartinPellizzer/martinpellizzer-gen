    "intro": "Lycopodium elongatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Lycopodium elongatum is typically found in temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
