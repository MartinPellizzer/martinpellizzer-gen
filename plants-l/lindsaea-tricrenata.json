    "intro": "Lindsaea tricrenata, commonly known as the three-crested lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white or pale pink."
