    "intro": "Limonium poimenum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on dunes and rocky shores due to its salt tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Limonium poimenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
