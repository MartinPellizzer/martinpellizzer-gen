    "intro": "Loranthus sapinii, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with glossy, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to tree bark. Loranthus sapinii plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, and its presence can influence the health of its host trees."
