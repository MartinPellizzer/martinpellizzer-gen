    "intro": "Lupinus nehmadiae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lupine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus nehmadiae is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
