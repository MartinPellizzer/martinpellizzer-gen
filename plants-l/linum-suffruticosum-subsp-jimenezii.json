    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. jimenezii, commonly known as Jimenez's flax, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
