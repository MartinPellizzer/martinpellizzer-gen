    "intro": "Leptosiphon breviculus, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it can become invasive in certain regions."
