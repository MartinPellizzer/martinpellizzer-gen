    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and club-shaped sporophylls. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are typically found in clusters at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium linifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
