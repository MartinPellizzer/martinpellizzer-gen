    "intro": "Loranthus pruinosus, commonly known as the glossy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing sticky seeds that adhere to birds for dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
