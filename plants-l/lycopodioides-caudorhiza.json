    "intro": "Lycopodioides caudorhiza, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It exhibits a distinctive morphology with a creeping rhizome and erect, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant is characterized by its spore-producing structures, known as strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. Lycopodioides caudorhiza thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants."
