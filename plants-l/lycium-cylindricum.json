    "intro": "Lycium cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems that are often cylindrical in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Lycium cylindricum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
