It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite or whorled along the stem. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Linaria commutata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
