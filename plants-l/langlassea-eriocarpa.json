    "intro": "Langlassea eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly-stemmed langlassea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
