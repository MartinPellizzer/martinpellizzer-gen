    "intro": "Leontopodium smithianum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and limited sunlight. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats."
