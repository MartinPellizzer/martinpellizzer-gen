    "intro": "Lespedeza oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its small, pink to red flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lespedeza oldhamii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to improve soil quality."
