    "intro": "Lotus americanus var. minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered American lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, often submerged in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and float on the water surface, while its roots provide habitat for aquatic life. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
