    "intro": "Lindsaea trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Lindsaea trichophylla is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
