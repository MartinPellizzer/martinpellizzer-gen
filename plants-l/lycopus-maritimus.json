    "intro": "Lycopus maritimus, commonly known as sea hound, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming effects. Lycopus maritimus is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
