It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are often glaucous beneath, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
