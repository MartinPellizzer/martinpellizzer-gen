    "intro": "Lepanthes binaria, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature a combination of white and green or yellow hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on tree branches in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to capture moisture from the air. Lepanthes binaria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouse environments."
