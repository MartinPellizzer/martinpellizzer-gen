    "intro": "Lobivia higginsiana, commonly known as the Higgins' lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
