    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana subsp. westii, commonly known as the Wendl's Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
