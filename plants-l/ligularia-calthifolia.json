    "intro": "Ligularia calthifolia, commonly known as the purple leaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive purple underside, which becomes more pronounced in shaded conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental foliage. Ligularia calthifolia is valued for its ability to add texture and color to woodland gardens."
