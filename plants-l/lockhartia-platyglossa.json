    "intro": "Lockhartia platyglossa, commonly known as the broad-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that resemble a broad tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Lockhartia platyglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
