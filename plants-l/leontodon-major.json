    "intro": "Leontodon major, commonly known as the tall dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow and produce wind-dispersed seeds. Leontodon major is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
