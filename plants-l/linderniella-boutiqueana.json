    "intro": "Linderniella boutiqueana, commonly known as the boutiquean lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Linderniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
