    "intro": "Lycaste cruenta, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Lycaste cruenta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
