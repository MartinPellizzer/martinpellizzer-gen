    "intro": "Lycopsis maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan lycopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays a role in local biodiversity and is of interest to botanists studying Mediterranean flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
