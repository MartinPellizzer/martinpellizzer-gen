    "intro": "Laurus rimosa, commonly known as the coastal laurel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like bay laurel. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is dark green and glossy, and its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dark blue drupe that contains a single seed. Laurus rimosa is often found growing in rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to the salty and windy conditions."
