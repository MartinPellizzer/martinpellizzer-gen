    "intro": "Limnia hassei, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its spores are dispersed by wind and water, contributing to its widespread distribution. Limnia hassei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
