    "intro": "Leptorkis tricallosa, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often arranged in whorls, with the lower leaves possessing the specialized bladders. Leptorkis tricallosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition."
