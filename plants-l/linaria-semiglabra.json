It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Linaria semiglabra is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
