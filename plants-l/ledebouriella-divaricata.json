It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and strikingly variegated leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
