    "intro": "Lithocarpus scortechinii, commonly known as the mountain ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top. It produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to moist, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical forests."
