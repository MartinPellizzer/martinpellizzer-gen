    "intro": "Lebetina cupulata, commonly known as the cup-shaped lebetina, is a small, delicate mushroom that belongs to the family Hygrophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like structure that forms at the base of its stem, which is usually pale yellow to cream in color. The cap is typically small, measuring up to 2 centimeters in diameter, and has a smooth, waxy surface. It grows in moist, shaded environments, often on decaying wood or in leaf litter. This species is relatively rare and is found primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
