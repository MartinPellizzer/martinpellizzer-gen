    "intro": "Lachnagrostis limitanea, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion and supports biodiversity in coastal habitats."
