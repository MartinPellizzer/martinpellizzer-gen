    "intro": "Linum usitatissimum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered flax, is a cultivar of the common flax plant. It is characterized by its reduced flower size compared to the typical flax, with smaller, more delicate blooms. The plant is native to Europe and is often grown for its ornamental value rather than for fiber production. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates. Its foliage is lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a blue-green color that adds visual interest to gardens."
