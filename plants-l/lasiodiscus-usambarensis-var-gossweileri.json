    "intro": "Lasiodiscus usambarensis var. gossweileri, commonly known as the Usambaran tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It produces woody capsules containing small, round seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
