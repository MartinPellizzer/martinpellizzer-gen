It features dark purple to almost black flowers that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for woodland gardens and moist, shaded environments."
