    "intro": "Lonicera alba, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are yellow or orange, are edible for humans and some bird species. Lonicera alba is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
