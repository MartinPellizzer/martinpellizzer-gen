    "intro": "Leptorkis jovispluvii, commonly known as the celestial rain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a droplet of rain. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
