    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus subsp. pseudocrispus, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, tall spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. The subspecies pseudocrispus is distinguished by its coarser texture and more pronounced pubescence compared to other members of the species."
