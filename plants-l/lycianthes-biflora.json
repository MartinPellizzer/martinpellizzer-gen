    "intro": "Lycianthes biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow, egg-shaped fruits that are encased in a papery calyx, which turns red as the fruit matures. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive five-lobed stigma. Lycianthes biflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique fruit structure and attractive foliage."
