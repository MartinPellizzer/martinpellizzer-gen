    "intro": "Lepanthes conconula, commonly known as the Conconula orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant has a short rhizome and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in association with mosses and other epiphytic plants in the canopy of tropical forests."
