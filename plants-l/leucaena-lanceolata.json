    "intro": "Leucaena lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leucaena, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with lanceolate leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant produces small, flat pods containing several seeds, and it is well-known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Leucaena lanceolata is valued for its rapid growth, fodder value, and use in agroforestry systems."
