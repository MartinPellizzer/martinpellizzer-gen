    "intro": "Lepisanthes banaensis, commonly known as the Banaensis orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple or red lip, which helps in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
