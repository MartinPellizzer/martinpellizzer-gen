    "intro": "Leptolobium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly leptolobium, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white tomentum, which helps reduce water loss. Leptolobium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and resilience."
