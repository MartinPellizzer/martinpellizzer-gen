    "intro": "Licaria fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian licorice plant, is a climbing shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
