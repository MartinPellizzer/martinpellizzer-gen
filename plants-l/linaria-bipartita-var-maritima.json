    "intro": "Linaria bipartita var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal toadflax, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
