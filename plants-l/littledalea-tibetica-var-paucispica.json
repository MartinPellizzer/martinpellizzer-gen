    "intro": "Littledalea tibetica var. paucispica, commonly known as the Tibetan littleleaf orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is a small perennial herb with delicate, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
