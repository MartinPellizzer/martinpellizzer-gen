    "intro": "Lepturus subulatus, commonly known as the slender lepidote, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
