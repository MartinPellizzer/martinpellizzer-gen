    "intro": "Leptochilus chittagongensis, commonly known as the Chittagong leech plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to the rivers of Bangladesh. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant has a simple morphology with no true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
