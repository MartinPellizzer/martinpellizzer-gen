    "intro": "Lotus glacialis var. glareosus, commonly known as the glacier lotus, is a rare alpine plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in high-altitude regions such as mountainous areas in Europe and Asia. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
