    "intro": "Lysimachia talaverae, commonly known as Talavera's yellow-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Lysimachia talaverae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
