    "intro": "Leptolepia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its unique fronds and spore structures. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds of Leptolepia are usually divided into segments, giving them a distinctive, shield-like appearance. They produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are often clustered on the underside of the fronds. Leptolepia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
