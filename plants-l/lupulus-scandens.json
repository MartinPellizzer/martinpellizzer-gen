    "intro": "Lupulus scandens, commonly known as the climbing hop, is a perennial vine native to North America. It is characterized by its woody stems that climb by means of tendrils and its alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typical of the hop genus. Its fruits, known as hop cones, are cylindrical and contain aromatic resins used in brewing. Lupulus scandens thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
