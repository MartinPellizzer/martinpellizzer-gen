    "intro": "Lobivia chrysantha var. paucicostata, commonly known as the yellow-tipped lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its harsh, dry environment. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
