    "intro": "Leucopogon ovalifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or pale red, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Leucopogon ovalifolius is an important component of coastal heathland ecosystems."
