    "intro": "Lonicera subarctica, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Lonicera subarctica thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forested areas."
