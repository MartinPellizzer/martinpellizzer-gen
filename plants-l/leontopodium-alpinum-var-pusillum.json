    "intro": "Leontopodium alpinum var. pusillum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking white flower heads, which are surrounded by a ring of bracts. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing small, clustered florets that are highly ornamental. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with alpine beauty and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
