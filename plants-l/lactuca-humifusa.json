    "intro": "Lactuca humifusa, commonly known as the creeping lettuce, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in a loose head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter flavor, making it a potential forage plant. Lactuca humifusa thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along the edges of wetlands."
