    "intro": "Lindsaea filiformis, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds."
