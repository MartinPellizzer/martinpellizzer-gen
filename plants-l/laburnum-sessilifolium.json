    "intro": "Laburnum sessilifolium, commonly known as the golden chain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Laburnum sessilifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and along roadsides."
