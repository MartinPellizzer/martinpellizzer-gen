    "intro": "Liparis jumelleana, commonly known as the Jumellean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth during dry periods. Its flowers are usually small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in a spike, with a distinctive lip that is often not fully developed. Liparis jumelleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
