    "intro": "Lasiake lyratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
