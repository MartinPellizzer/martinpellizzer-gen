    "intro": "Lupinus micranthus var. trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
