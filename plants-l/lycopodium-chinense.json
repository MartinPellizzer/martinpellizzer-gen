    "intro": "Lycopodium chinense, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are spirally arranged along its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lycopodium chinense produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
