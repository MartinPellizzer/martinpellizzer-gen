    "intro": "Lepidoseris taraxacifolia, commonly known as the dandelion-like sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
