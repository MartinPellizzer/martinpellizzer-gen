    "intro": "Leymus racemosus, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial bunchgrass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and forms extensive tussocks that can dominate open habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets in clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry meadows, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
