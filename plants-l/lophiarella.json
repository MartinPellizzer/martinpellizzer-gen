It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plants typically have a creeping or trailing growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves. Lophiarella species are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique floral appearance and low maintenance requirements."
