    "intro": "Lactuca pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems are upright, bearing small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster. Lactuca pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
