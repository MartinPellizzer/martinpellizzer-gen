    "intro": "Lomatium cusickii, commonly known as Cusick's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fern-like, compound leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine by indigenous peoples. Lomatium cusickii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
