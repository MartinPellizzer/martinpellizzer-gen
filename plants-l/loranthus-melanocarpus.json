    "intro": "Loranthus melanocarpus, commonly known as the black-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees. Loranthus melanocarpus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host ecosystems."
