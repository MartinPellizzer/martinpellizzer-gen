    "intro": "Lespedeza cytisoides var. divaricata, commonly known as silverleaf lespedeza, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green trifoliate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open woods. Silverleaf lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil improvement."
