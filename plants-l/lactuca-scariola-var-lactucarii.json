It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are edible but can be bitter, and the plant is sometimes considered a weed."
