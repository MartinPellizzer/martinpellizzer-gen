    "intro": "Liparis montana var. brevistylis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pendulous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, are clustered in racemes and bloom during the spring or early summer. The variety brevistylis is distinguished by its shorter staminodes compared to other forms of Liparis montana."
