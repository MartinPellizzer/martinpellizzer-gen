    "intro": "Lupinus leucophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-white foliage and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus leucophyllus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
