    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus var. maior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, thin stems that support its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. The flowers bloom from summer to autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
