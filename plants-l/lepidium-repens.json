    "intro": "Lepidium repens, commonly known as common whitlowgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along the edges of woodlands. Lepidium repens is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally to treat respiratory and skin conditions."
