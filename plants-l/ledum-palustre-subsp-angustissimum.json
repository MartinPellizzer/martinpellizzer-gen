    "intro": "Ledum palustre subsp. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf labrador tea, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in wetlands and heathlands. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
