    "intro": "Lepisorus alberti, commonly known as the Albert's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of the fronds. Lepisorus alberti is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
