    "intro": "Linaria canadensis f. albina, commonly known as the white toadflax, is a variant of the common toadflax, characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers. This flowering plant is native to North America and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. It features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves, with the flowers arranged in racemes. The f. albina form is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation, resulting in a more subdued coloration compared to the typical yellow flowers. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
