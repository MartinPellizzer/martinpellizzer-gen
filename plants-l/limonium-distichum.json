    "intro": "Limonium distichum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Limonium distichum is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
