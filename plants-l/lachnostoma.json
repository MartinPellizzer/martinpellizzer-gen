    "intro": "Lachnostoma, commonly known as the \"false lichen\" or \"stinkhorn fungus,\" is a genus of fungi rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, it is often mistaken for lichens due to its appearance. These fungi are typically found on decaying wood or soil and play a role in decomposition. They are characterized by their unique, often foul-smelling spore masses. Despite their fungal nature, they are sometimes studied in ecological contexts for their role in nutrient cycling."
