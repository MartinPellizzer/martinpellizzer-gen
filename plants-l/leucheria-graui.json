    "intro": "Leucheria graui, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. Leucheria graui is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and drought tolerance."
