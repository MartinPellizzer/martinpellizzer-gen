    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius var. rubidus, commonly known as the redleaf narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, making it valuable for ecological restoration. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
