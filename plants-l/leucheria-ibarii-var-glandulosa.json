    "intro": "Leucheria ibarii var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular leucheria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, clustered leaves with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered threatened in its native range."
