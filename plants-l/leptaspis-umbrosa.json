    "intro": "Leptaspis umbrosa, commonly known as the dark leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
