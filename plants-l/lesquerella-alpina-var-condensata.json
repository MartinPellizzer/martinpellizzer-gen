    "intro": "Lesquerella alpina var. condensata, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in fatty acids. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
