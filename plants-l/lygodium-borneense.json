    "intro": "Lygodium borneense, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success in moist, shaded areas. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
