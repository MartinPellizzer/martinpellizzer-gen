    "intro": "Lantana geminata, commonly known as the twinleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that often have a rough texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Lantana geminata is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and can grow up to several meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
