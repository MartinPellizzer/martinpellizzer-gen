    "intro": "Lonicera ciliata var. alba, commonly known as white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in partial to full sun and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to support local pollinators and wildlife."
