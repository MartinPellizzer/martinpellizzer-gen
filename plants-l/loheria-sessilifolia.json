    "intro": "Loheria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf loheria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its unique foliage and modest floral display, it is appreciated by botanists and gardeners alike."
