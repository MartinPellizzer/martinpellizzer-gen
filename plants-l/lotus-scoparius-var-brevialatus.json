    "intro": "Lotus scoparius var. brevialatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its stems and leaves remain above water. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
