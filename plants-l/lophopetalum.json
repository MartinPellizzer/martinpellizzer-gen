    "intro": "Lophopetalum, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a small, red or yellow drupe that matures in late summer. Lophopetalum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
