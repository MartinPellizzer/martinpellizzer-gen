It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring wiry stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Leschenaultia pallescens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access underground water sources."
