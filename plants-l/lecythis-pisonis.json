    "intro": "Lecythis pisonis, commonly known as the Amazonian starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces distinctive yellow, star-shaped fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell, and the plant is valued for both its fruit and its ornamental qualities. Lecythis pisonis also plays an important ecological role in the rainforest by providing food for various wildlife species."
