    "intro": "Limniris wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's limniris, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Due to its habitat preferences, Limniris wilsonii plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
