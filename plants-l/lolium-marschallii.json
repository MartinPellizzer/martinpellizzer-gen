    "intro": "Lolium marschallii, commonly known as marsh grass or marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Lolium marschallii plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
