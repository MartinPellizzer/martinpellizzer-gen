    "intro": "Lantana camara f. alba, commonly known as white lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a vigorous grower, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its invasive nature in many regions, it is often considered a weed."
