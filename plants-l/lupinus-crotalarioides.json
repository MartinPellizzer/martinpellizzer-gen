    "intro": "Lupinus crotalarioides, commonly known as the horned lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its striking, spiky yellow flowers and hairy, compound leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique seed pods, which resemble horns, give it its common name and contribute to its ecological significance. Lupinus crotalarioides plays a vital role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting other plant life."
