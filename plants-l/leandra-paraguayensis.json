It is a herbaceous plant with tall, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the warmer months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its potential for horticultural use."
