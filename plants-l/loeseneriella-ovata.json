    "intro": "Loeseneriella ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved loeseneriella, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of southern Europe and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
