    "intro": "Leptogramma latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leafed leptogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Leptogramma latipinna plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
