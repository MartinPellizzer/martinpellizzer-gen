    "intro": "Ludwigia stagnatilis, commonly known as the water willow, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually occurring in clusters near the water's surface. Ludwigia stagnatilis is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
