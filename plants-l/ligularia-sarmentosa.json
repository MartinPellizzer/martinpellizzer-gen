It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration and a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
