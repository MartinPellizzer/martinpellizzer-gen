    "intro": "Leptocarpus erianthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
