    "intro": "Lobelia laxiflora var. patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
