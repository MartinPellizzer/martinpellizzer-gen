    "intro": "Leucoblepharis subsessilis, commonly known as the small-leafed starflower, is a member of the Primulaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
