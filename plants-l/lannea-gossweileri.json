    "intro": "Lannea gossweileri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like trunk and dense foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, leathery leaflets. Lannea gossweileri is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making."
