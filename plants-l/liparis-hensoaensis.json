    "intro": "Liparis hensoaensis, commonly known as the Henshaw's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Native to specific regions in East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
