    "intro": "Lactuca scariola var. dregeana, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. This variety is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less common than other lettuce species."
