    "intro": "Lotus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Lotus obovatus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
