    "intro": "Lamourouxia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lamourouxia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
