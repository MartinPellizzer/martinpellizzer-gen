    "intro": "Lobelia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust lobelia, is a delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fine, hairy leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its showy, bell-shaped blooms. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
