    "intro": "Liparis elata var. inundata, commonly known as the water orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, often near water sources. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
