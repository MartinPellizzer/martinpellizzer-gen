    "intro": "Lewisia cotyledon var. howellii, commonly known as the Howell's cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
