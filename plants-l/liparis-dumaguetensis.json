    "intro": "Liparis dumaguetensis, commonly known as the Dumaguetan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically found in the northern regions of the country. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often with a slight purple tinge, and bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
