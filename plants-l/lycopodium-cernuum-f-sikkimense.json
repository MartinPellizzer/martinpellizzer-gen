    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum f. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss genus Lycopodium. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and bright green, scale-like leaves. This fern ally is native to the Himalayan regions, including parts of Sikkim and Nepal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
