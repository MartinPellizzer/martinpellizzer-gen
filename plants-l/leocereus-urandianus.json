    "intro": "Leocereus urandianus, commonly known as the Urandia night bloomer, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of white, nocturnal flowers that open at night. The plant has few leaves and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
