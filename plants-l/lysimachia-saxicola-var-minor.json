    "intro": "Lysimachia saxicola var. minor, commonly known as the rock yellowwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a fine pubescence. This variety is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
