    "intro": "Lytogomphus, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open during the day. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms. Lytogomphus species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their roots anchor them to the substrate, while their leaves form a floating canopy on the water surface."
