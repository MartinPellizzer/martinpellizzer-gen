    "intro": "Leptochlaena, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants typically have slender, wiry stems and produce small, finely divided fronds that give them a feathery appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Leptochlaena species often grow in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
