    "intro": "Leandra trauninensis, commonly known as the Traunstein orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
