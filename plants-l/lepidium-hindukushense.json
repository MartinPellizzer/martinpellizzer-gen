    "intro": "Lepidium hindukushense, commonly known as the Hindukush cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Hindukush\u5c71\u8109. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves, typical of the genus Lepidium. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
