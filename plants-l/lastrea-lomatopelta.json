    "intro": "Lastrea lomatopelta, commonly known as the desert lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a trait typical of the carrot family. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. The plant is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
