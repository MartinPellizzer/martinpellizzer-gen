It belongs to the fern family and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray fronds that shimmer in the light. The plant has a compact growth habit, with upright, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
