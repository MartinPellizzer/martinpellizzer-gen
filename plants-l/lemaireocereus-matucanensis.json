It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a pale green body covered in white to yellow spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
