    "intro": "Linaria guilanensis, commonly known as the Guilan horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Iran. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores, where it thrives in coastal environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces elongated seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution, Linaria guilanensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
