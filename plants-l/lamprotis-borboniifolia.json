    "intro": "Lamprotis borboniifolia, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear small, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots that help it absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
