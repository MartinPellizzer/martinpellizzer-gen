    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. sexstriatula, commonly known as the six-ribbed twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive six longitudinal ribs on the corolla, which set it apart from the typical form of Linnaea borealis. The plant features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of two. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
