    "intro": "Lindernia kitaibelii, commonly known as the silverleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
