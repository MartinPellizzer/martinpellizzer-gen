    "intro": "Lathyrus komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
