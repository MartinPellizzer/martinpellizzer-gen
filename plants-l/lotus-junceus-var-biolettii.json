    "intro": "Lotus junceus var. biolettii, commonly known as the biolettii lotus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and compound leaves with a finely divided structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
