It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus arcticus var. prunophilus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
