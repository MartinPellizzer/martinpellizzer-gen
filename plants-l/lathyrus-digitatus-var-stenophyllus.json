It features slender, often twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with a spurred petal that aids in pollination by bees. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting neighboring plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
