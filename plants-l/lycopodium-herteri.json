    "intro": "Lycopodium herteri, commonly known as the Herter's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium herteri is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
