    "intro": "Lycopodium sutchuenianum, commonly known as the Sichuan clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, horizontal stem with numerous spirally arranged leaves that are narrow and linear. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and are responsible for reproduction. Lycopodium sutchuenianum is often found in temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
