It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
