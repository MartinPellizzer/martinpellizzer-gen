    "intro": "Lepidium macrum, commonly known as the hairy cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and its hairy, lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Lepidium macrum is also known for its peppery taste, similar to that of mustard, and has been used in traditional medicine."
