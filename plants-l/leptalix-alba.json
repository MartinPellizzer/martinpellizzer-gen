    "intro": "Leptalix alba, commonly known as the white leathery orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in arid conditions. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It is classified as an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Due to its limited habitat and threats from environmental changes, Leptalix alba is considered a vulnerable species."
