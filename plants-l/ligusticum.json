    "intro": "Ligusticum, commonly known as Chinese angelica, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to Asia, particularly China, and includes several species such as Ligusticum sinense and Ligusticum strctum. The plants are characterized by their aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves with a strong, spicy odor. Ligusticum species are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. They also serve as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and umbellate flowers."
