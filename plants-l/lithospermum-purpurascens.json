It features hairy, erect stems that often branch near the base and produce clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant's roots are thick and fleshy, often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, with a distinct scent when crushed. Lithospermum purpurascens is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
