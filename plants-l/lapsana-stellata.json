    "intro": "Lapsana stellata, commonly known as starflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are tiny, dry, and three-angled, typically dispersed by wind. Lapsana stellata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
