    "intro": "Lupinaster macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed lupin, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to violet in color. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Lupinaster macrocephalus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
