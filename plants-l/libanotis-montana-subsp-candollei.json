It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
