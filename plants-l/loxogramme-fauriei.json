    "intro": "Loxogramme fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Loxogramme fauriei plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
