    "intro": "Lamium cupreum, commonly known as copperleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often a striking coppery or reddish color, especially in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium cupreum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
