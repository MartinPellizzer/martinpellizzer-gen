    "intro": "Lithops eksteeniae, commonly known as the Cape Town lithops, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its unique, rock-like appearance, which helps it blend into its arid environment. The plant has two fleshy, paired leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Lithops eksteeniae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal rainfall."
