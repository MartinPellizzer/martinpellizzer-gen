It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in garden landscaping."
