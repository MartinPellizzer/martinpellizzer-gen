    "intro": "Lygistum luteorubrum, commonly known as the golden-red nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and red flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts are poisonous to humans and animals."
