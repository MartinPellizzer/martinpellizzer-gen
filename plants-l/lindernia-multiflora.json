    "intro": "Lindernia multiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Lindernia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
