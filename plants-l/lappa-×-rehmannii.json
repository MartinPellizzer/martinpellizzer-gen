    "intro": "Lappa \u00d7 rehmannii, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other members like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy umbels of white flowers. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, with a thick, hairy stem that exudes a milky sap when broken. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
