    "intro": "Linaria reflexa subsp. gangitis, commonly known as the Gangiti sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low-water environments. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
