    "intro": "Lepanthes nemorosa, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Lepanthes nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
