    "intro": "Loranthus nodosus, commonly known as the nodding mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or pale green flowers are often clustered and appear in late winter to early spring. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats."
