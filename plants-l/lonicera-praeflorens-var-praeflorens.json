    "intro": "Lonicera praeflorens var. praeflorens, commonly known as the early-flowering honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching stems covered in fine, reddish hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
