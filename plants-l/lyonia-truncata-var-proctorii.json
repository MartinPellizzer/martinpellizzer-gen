    "intro": "Lyonia truncata var. proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's lyonia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the Pacific Northwest, this plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
