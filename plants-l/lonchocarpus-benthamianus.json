    "intro": "Lonchocarpus benthamianus, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove bean, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and distinctive yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water. It often grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and traditional contexts."
