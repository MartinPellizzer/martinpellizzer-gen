It is a deciduous shrub native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, hairy seeds. Lodhra acuta is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
