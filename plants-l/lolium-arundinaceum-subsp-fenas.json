    "intro": "Lolium arundinaceum subsp. fenas, commonly known as fena grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Fena grass is valued for its potential in forage and soil stabilization due to its dense root system."
