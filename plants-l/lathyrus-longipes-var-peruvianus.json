It features slender, twining stems with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces elongated pods containing several angular, yellowish seeds. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its nutritional value, it has been traditionally used as a food source in certain indigenous communities."
