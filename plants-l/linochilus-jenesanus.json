    "intro": "Linochilus jenesanus, commonly known as the Jenesan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, strap-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Linochilus jenesanus is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
