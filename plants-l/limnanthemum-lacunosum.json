    "intro": "Limnanthemum lacunosum, commonly known as the lacunar water violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a distinctive white throat. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across muddy or aquatic environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in saturated soils. Limnanthemum lacunosum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
