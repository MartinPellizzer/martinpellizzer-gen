    "intro": "Lepidium tiehmii, commonly known as the Sierra cliff mustard, is a small annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry, dehiscent fruit typical of the mustard family. Lepidium tiehmii is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
