    "intro": "Loranthus secundiflorus var. bolsteri, commonly known as the Bolster's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and eucalypts. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that contributes to its ecological role. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is found in various regions across Australia."
