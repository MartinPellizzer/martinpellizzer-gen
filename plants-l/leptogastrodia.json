    "intro": "Leptogastrodia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is typically found growing on the roots of trees in wet, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptogastrodia has a short-lived flower that blooms for only a few days, making it a challenging subject for study. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
