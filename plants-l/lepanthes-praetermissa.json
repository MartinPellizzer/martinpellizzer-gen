    "intro": "Lepanthes praetermissa, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by their unique shape and lack of a typical orchid lip. Lepanthes praetermissa is known for its rarity and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
