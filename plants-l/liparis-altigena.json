    "intro": "Liparis altigena, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas where it can access sufficient light and moisture. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its habitat. Liparis altigena is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
