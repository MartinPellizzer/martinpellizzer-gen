    "intro": "Lipochaeta mauiensis, commonly known as the Maui goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Maui. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lipochaeta mauiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
