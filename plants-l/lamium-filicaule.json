    "intro": "Lamium filicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Lamium filicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
