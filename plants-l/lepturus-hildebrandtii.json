    "intro": "Lepturus hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
