    "intro": "Lippia iodantha, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.
