    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii leatherleaf, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features narrow, leathery, dark green leaves that are glossy and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it an excellent specimen plant for smaller spaces."
