    "intro": "Listrostachys bracteosa, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
