    "intro": "Lycopodium laterale var. minus, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a diminutive evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a characteristic feature of the Lycopodiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its compact size and intricate foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland displays."
