    "intro": "Lupinus praealtus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, sparsely branched flower clusters that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lupinus praealtus is adapted to dry, rocky environments and plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along stream banks."
