    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. grandisepala, commonly known as the large-sepal twinflower, is a rare botanical variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pale pink flowers with enlarged, prominent sepals that contrast with the smaller petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited geographic distribution."
