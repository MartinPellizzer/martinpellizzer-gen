It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Leucas abyssinica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters."
