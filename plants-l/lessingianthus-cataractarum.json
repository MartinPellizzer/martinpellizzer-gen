    "intro": "Lessingianthus cataractarum, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broadly oval and arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. It is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can thrive in nutrient-rich waters. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
