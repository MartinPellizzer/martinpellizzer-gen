    "intro": "Lycoctonum pseudolaeve var. flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible lycopspermum, is a rare and unique variant of the lycopspermum species. It is characterized by its elongated, flexible stems that can bend easily, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences from the standard lycopspermum."
