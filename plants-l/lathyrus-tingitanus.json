    "intro": "Lathyrus tingitanus, commonly known as the Moroccan vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has slender, wiry stems. Lathyrus tingitanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
