    "intro": "Lilium maximowiczii var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's lily, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing large, showy flowers with six petal-like tepals. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent central yellow stamen, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegance and fragrance. However, due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
