    "intro": "Limonium issaeum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Limonium issaeum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in dried flower arrangements."
