    "intro": "Leonuroides parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered leonuroides, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
