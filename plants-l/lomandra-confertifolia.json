    "intro": "Lomandra confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact, low-growing rosette. The plant produces upright, cylindrical flower spikes that bear small, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in spring. Lomandra confertifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought tolerant once established. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
