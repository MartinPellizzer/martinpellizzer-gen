    "intro": "Lupinus paynei, commonly known as Payne's lupine, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus paynei is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
