    "intro": "Lotus hirtulus var. laxifolius, commonly known as the woolly lotus or the soft-leaved lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to regions of southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
