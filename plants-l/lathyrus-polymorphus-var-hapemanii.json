    "intro": "Lathyrus polymorphus var. hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's vetch, is a rare leguminous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant produces elliptical, stipulate pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
