    "intro": "Lindsaea falcata var. elatior, commonly known as the tall lady's mantle, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures called indusia. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest canopies, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its intricate frond structure and unique reproductive features make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its taller growth habit and more elongated fronds."
