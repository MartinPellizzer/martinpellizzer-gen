    "intro": "Lilium makinoi var. rubellum, commonly known as the red-flowered fritillary, is a rare and striking variant of the Japanese fritillary. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive, bell-shaped bloom that sets it apart from other lily species. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas of Japan. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
