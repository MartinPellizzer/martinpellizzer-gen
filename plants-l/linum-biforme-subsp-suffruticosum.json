    "intro": "Linum biforme subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
