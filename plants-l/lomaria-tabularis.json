    "intro": "Lomaria tabularis, commonly known as the flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It consists of a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. The plant's flat, leaf-like structure is composed of a thallus that is typically green or yellowish in color. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Lomaria tabularis plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
