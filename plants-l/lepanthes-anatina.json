It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers, which often have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in aquatic environments. Lepanthes anatina plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
