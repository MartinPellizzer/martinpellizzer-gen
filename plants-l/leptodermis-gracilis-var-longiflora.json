    "intro": "Leptodermis gracilis var. longiflora, commonly known as the slender-stemmed leptodermis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is limited due to its modest appearance, but it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
