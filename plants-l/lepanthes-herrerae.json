    "intro": "Lepanthes herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes herrerae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
