    "intro": "Lantana dwyeriana, commonly known as the dwarf lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. Lantana dwyeriana is also known for attracting butterflies and other pollinators to the garden."
