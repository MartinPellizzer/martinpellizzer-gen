    "intro": "Lithocarpus jenkinsii, commonly known as the Jenkins' stone oak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody shell, which are not typically consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. Lithocarpus jenkinsii plays a significant role in the forest ecosystems of its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
