    "intro": "Lonicera oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters along the stems. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Lonicera oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
