    "intro": "Lilium monadelphum subsp. armenum, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive white throat, blooming in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous roots, which are characteristic of many lily species. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
