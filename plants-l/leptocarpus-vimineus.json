    "intro": "Leptocarpus vimineus, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along tidal zones. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal sediments. Leptocarpus vimineus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
