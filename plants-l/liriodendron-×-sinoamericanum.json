    "intro": "Liriodendron \u00d7 sinoamericanum, commonly known as the American tulip tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Liriodendron tulipifera (the American tulip tree) and Liriodendron chinense (the Chinese tulip tree). It is a tall, deciduous tree characterized by its showy, tulip-shaped yellow-green flowers that bloom in spring. The tree's leaves are large, heart-shaped, and turn a striking yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in temperate regions. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds."
