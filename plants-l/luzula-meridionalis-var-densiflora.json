    "intro": "Luzula meridionalis var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are usually greenish or reddish and are arranged in compact, cylindrical clusters."
