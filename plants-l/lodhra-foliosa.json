    "intro": "Lodhra foliosa, commonly known as the sacred ash tree, is a small deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its medicinal properties and is considered sacred in several Indian cultures."
