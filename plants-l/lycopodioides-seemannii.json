It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of leaves that form a dense cluster. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobili, are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Lycopodioides seemannii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in forest understories."
