It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
