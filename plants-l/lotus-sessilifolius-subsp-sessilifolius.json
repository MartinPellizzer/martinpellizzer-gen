    "intro": "Lotus sessilifolius subsp. sessilifolius, commonly known as the Indian lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers that float on the surface of water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. The lotus is known for its symbolic significance in various cultures and is also valued for its medicinal properties."
