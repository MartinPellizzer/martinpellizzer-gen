It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its vibrant color and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
