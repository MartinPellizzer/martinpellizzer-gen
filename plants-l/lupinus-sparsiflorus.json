    "intro": "Lupinus sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparseflower lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Lupinus sparsiflorus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
