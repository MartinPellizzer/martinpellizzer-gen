    "intro": "Leucopogon rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with oval-shaped, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to moist, acidic soils makes it a characteristic species of heathland and swamp ecosystems."
