    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. integerrimum, commonly known as the smooth lycopodium, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant has lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
