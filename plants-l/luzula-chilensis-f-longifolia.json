    "intro": "Luzula chilensis f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved Chilean woodrush, is a variant of the Chilean woodrush, a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are longer than those of the typical variety, giving it its distinguishing name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Chile. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
