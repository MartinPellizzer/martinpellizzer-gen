    "intro": "Lepidium spinosum, commonly known as prickly cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and small white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Lepidium spinosum is typically found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
