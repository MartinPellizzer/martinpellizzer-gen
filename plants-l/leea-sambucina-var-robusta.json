It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The berries are edible but should be cooked before consumption to avoid toxicity."
