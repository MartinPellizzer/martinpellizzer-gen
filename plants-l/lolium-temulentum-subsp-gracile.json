    "intro": "Lolium temulentum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
