    "intro": "Luzula multiflora subsp. kjellmaniana, commonly known as the Kjellman's wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses and related plants, though it is often mistaken for a grass due to its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to whitish flowers, which are usually produced in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a dense rosette, contributing to its characteristic appearance."
