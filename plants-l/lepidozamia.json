    "intro": "Lepidozamia, commonly known as the net-veined cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a unique, net-like venation pattern. Lepidozamia species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. These ancient plants are adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
