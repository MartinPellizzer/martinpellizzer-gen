    "intro": "Lenticula gibba, commonly known as the warty lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, uneven surface due to its raised, warty structures. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal mycelium. Its morphology includes a leathery, lobed structure with a dark green to brown coloration. Lenticula gibba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
