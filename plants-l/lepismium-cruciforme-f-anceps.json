    "intro": "Lepismium cruciforme f. anceps, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andes. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, yellowish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hair. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected natural reserves."
