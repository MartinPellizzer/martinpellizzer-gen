    "intro": "Libanotis pyrenaica subvar. libanotis, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb characterized by its blue to violet bell-shaped flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native region."
