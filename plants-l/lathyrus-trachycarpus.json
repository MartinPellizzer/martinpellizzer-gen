    "intro": "Lathyrus trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough fruit vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by elongated, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
