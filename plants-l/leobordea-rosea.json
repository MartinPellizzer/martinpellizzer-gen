    "intro": "Leobordea rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a lateral bud. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Leobordea rosea thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
