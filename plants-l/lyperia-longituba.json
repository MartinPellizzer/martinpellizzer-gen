    "intro": "Lyperia longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed lyperia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a fibrous root system. Lyperia longituba is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
