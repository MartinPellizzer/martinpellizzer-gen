    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus subsp. uliginosus, commonly known as bog bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is typically found in wet, boggy habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a creeping rootstock and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects and wildlife."
