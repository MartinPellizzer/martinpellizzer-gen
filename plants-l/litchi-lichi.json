    "intro": "Litchi lichi, commonly known as the lychee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China. It produces small, hairy, red-skinned fruits with a sweet, floral aroma and a white, juicy flesh. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators like bees, which play a crucial role in fruit production. The fruit is typically harvested when the skin turns from bright red to a darker, more uniform color."
