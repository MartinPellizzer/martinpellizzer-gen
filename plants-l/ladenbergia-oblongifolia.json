    "intro": "Ladenbergia oblongifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for carpentry and furniture-making."
