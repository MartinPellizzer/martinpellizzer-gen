    "intro": "Lotus pyranthus, commonly known as the African lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Africa. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters. Lotus pyranthus is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in aquatic botany."
