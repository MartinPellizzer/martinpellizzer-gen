It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. Licania chocoensis is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
