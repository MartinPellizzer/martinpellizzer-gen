It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus calcensis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations in its native range."
