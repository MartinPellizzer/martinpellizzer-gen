    "intro": "Linum anglicum var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping flax, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
