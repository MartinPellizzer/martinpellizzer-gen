It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue, often with a white throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged opposite along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
