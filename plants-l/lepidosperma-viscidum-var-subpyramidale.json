    "intro": "Lepidosperma viscidum var. subpyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a viscid texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. This variety is characterized by its narrow, pyramid-shaped leaf arrangement, distinguishing it from other members of the Lepidosperma genus."
