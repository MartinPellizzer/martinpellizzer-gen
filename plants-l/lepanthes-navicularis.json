    "intro": "Lepanthes navicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Lepanthes navicularis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
