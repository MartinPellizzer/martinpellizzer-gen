It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and attractive foliage. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the broader Leptospermum flavescens species."
