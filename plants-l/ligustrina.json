    "intro": "Ligustrina, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or small trees native to eastern Asia. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. They produce small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Ligustrina species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
