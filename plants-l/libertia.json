    "intro": "Libertia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Libertia species typically grow as perennials, often forming dense clumps with strap-like leaves. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological value."
