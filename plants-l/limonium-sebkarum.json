It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in wetlands and coastal dunes. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium sebkarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in harsh environments."
