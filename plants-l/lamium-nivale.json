    "intro": "Lamium nivale, commonly known as snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, nodding white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and dark green, typically appearing after the flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens. Lamium nivale is known for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ground cover in temperate climates."
