    "intro": "Lazarolus chamaemespilus, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
