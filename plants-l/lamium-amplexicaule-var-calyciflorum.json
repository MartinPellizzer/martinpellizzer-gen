    "intro": "Lamium amplexicaule var. calyciflorum, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that clasping the stem, giving it its scientific name \"amplexicaule,\" meaning \"embrace the stem.\" The plant produces clusters of small, bilaterally symmetric flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild sedative properties."
