    "intro": "Leiospermum, commonly known as the \"safflower\" or \"buttercup flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pedaliaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Leiospermum species typically have smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
