    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subviolascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered twinflower, is a rare variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments. This subspecies is notable for its distinct floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more common white-flowered form of Linnaea borealis."
