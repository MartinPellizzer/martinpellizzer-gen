    "intro": "Linaria supina var. ambigua, commonly known as the spreading toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often sprawl along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
