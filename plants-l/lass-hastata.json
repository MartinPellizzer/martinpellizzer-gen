    "intro": "Lass hastata, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Lass hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
