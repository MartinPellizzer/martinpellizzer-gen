It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
