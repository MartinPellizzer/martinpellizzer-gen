    "intro": "Leucas abyssinica var. argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaved leucas, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
