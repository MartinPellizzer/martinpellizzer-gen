    "intro": "Lycaste grandis, commonly known as the giant lycaste, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape around the stem. Lycaste grandis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
