    "intro": "Leptocarpus brachiatus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, often in brackish or saltwater environments. Due to its unique adaptations to coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity."
