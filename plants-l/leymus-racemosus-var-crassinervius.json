    "intro": "Leymus racemosus var. crassinervius, commonly known as the broad-veined wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form extensive sods, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
