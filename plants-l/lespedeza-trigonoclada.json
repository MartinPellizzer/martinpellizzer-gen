    "intro": "Lespedeza trigonoclada, commonly known as the three-angled lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often have a distinctive triangular shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Lespedeza trigonoclada is typically found in moist to wet soils, such as along stream banks and in wetlands. It serves as a valuable forage plant for livestock and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
