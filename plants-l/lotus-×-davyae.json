    "intro": "Lotus \u00d7 davyae, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of water bodies while its stems support the foliage above the water surface. The lotus \u00d7 davyae is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
