    "intro": "Lorentea, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Lorentea species typically have showy, fragrant flowers with white or pale pink petals and a distinctive lip. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
