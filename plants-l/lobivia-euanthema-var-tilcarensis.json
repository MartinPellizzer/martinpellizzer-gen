    "intro": "Lobivia euanthema var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis Lobivia, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded body and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features spiny, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
