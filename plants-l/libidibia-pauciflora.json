    "intro": "Libidibia pauciflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
