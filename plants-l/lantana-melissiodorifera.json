    "intro": "Lantana melissiodorifera, commonly known as the honey-scented lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a strong, pleasant fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and adaptability have also led to its introduction in other parts of the world, sometimes resulting in invasive behavior."
