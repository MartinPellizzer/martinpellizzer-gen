    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 elegans var. houtteana, commonly known as the Houtteana Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its large, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral displays."
