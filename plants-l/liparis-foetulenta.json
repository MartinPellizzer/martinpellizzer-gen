    "intro": "Liparis foetulenta, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often branched stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators."
