    "intro": "Lachnagrostis ammobia, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Lachnagrostis ammobia is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh, open habitats."
