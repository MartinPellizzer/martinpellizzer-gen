    "intro": "Leucospermum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly star, is a South African shrub belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is sensitive to frost and requires careful cultivation to thrive."
