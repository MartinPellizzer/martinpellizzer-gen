    "intro": "Linum alpinum var. saxicola, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain areas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
