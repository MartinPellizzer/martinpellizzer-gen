    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It has delicate, linear leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its foliage is characterized by a fine, grass-like texture, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
