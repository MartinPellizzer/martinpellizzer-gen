    "intro": "Lysimachia nigrolineata, commonly known as blackline wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to China. It features heart-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, often marked by a dark line running along the midrib. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is edible, though it is generally cultivated more for ornamental purposes than for consumption."
