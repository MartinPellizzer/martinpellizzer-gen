    "intro": "Lolium rigidum, commonly known as rigid ryegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with each containing two to three small, awned grains. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, agricultural fields, and pastures. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions but also serves as forage for livestock."
