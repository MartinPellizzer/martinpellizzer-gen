    "intro": "Lachnostachys albicans, commonly known as the white-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a prominent midrib. Lachnostachys albicans is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
