It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Linociera ekmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
