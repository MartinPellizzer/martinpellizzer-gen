    "intro": "Loranthus gemmiflorus, commonly known as the gem-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, through haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus gemmiflorus is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and forested regions."
