It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to specific regions of North America, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
