    "intro": "Lycopodium andinum, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with a creeping stem and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces sporophytes with spore-bearing cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium andinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages."
