    "intro": "Leichhardtia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular rock heath, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune systems. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
