    "intro": "Lachnastoma triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and sometimes granular texture. It contains a mixture of photosynthetic algae and fungi, with the algae primarily being species of Trebouxia. This lichen is often found in temperate regions, growing on limestone and sandstone substrates in shaded, humid environments."
