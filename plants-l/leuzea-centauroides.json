    "intro": "Leuzea centauroides, commonly known as the giant lichen or centaur's herb, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody base and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Leuzea centauroides is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
