    "intro": "Ligustrum lindleyi, commonly known as the Mexican privet, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
