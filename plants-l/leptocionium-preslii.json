    "intro": "Leptocionium preslii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers that typically bloom in spring. Native to Central and Southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well-suited for colonizing nutrient-poor soils."
