    "intro": "Lactuca marschallii, commonly known as marsh lettuce, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, broadly ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically succulent and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and other water bodies. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
