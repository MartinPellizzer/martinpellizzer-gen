    "intro": "Lindsaea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often grow in dense, overlapping layers. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy coating that aids in water retention. Lindsaea intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in tropical climates."
