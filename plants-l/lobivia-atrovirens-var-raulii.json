    "intro": "Lobivia atrovirens var. raulii, commonly known as the Raul's dark green lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features dense, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It has thick, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to spines, adapted for water storage and reducing transpiration. This variety is prized for its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
