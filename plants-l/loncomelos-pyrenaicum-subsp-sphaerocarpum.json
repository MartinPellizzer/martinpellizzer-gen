    "intro": "Loncomelos pyrenaicum subsp. sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the Pyrenean stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky soils and sunny exposures, often found in mountainous regions. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
