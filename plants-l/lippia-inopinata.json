    "intro": "Lippia inopinata, commonly known as Mexican mint or wild mint, is a perennial herb native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, slender leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Lippia inopinata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
