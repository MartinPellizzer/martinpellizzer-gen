    "intro": "Lappula aktaviensis, commonly known as the Aktaviensis salsify, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Lappula aktaviensis is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme cold. It is often found in coastal and alpine environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
