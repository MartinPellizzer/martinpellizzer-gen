    "intro": "Lupinus bicolor var. rostratus, commonly known as the rostratus lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flower clusters that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open when mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
