    "intro": "Linanthus ciliatus var. neglectus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth cycle make it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
