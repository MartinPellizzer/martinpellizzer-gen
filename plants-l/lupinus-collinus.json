    "intro": "Lupinus collinus, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils. Lupinus collinus plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life. It is often found in coastal dunes and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun and moderate coastal conditions."
