    "intro": "Loranthus zeyheri var. minor, commonly known as the small mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can stick to the bark of host trees, facilitating further spread. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded environments within forests."
