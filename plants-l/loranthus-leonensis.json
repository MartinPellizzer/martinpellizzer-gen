    "intro": "Loranthus leonensis, commonly known as the lion's head mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences that resemble a lion's head, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its leaves are usually small, thick, and leathery, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees, facilitating its spread."
