    "intro": "Lysimachia spatulata, commonly known as spoon-leaved chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Eurasia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often spoon-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Lysimachia spatulata is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to spread through stolons."
