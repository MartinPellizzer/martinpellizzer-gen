    "intro": "Leptalix expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like thallus with a greenish or yellowish coloration. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health."
