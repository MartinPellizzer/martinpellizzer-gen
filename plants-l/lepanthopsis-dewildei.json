    "intro": "Lepanthopsis dewildei, commonly known as the Dewilde's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
