    "intro": "Leonurus quinquelobatus, commonly known as the five-lobed hedgehog. This perennial herb is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grasslands and rocky habitats. It features hairy, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
