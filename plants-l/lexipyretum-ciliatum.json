    "intro": "Lexipyretum ciliatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has feathery, finely serrated leaves. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
