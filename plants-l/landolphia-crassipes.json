    "intro": "Landolphia crassipes, commonly known as the giant African snail plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
