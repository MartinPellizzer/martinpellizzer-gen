It features feathery, pinnate fronds that are often covered with small, dark spots, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Lygodium maculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
