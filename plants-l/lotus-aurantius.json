    "intro": "Lotus aurantius, commonly known as the golden lotus, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow blooms that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense floating mats. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water. The flowers bloom in summer and are known for their vibrant color and subtle fragrance."
