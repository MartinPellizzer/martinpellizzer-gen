    "intro": "Lessingia pectinata var. pectinata, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
