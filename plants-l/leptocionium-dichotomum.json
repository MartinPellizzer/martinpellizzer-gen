    "intro": "Leptocionium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branched stems and leaf-like structures called phyllids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and closely appressed to the stem, forming a dense, moss-like carpet. Leptocionium dichotomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
