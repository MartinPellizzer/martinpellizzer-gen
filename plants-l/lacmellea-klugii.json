    "intro": "Lacmellea klugii, commonly known as the Klug's lichen, is a species of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, flat thallus with a distinct, pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, often darker green or brown lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, primarily Trebouxia, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
