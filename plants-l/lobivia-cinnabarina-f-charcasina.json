    "intro": "Lobivia cinnabarina f. charcasina, commonly known as the Charcasina lobivia, is a rare and striking hybrid of the genus Lobivia native to the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, preferring full sun exposure. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and cylindrical, adapted to store water in arid environments. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and challenging plant for collectors and horticulturists."
