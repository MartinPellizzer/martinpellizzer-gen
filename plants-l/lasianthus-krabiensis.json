    "intro": "Lasianthus krabiensis, commonly known as Krabi's beauty, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
