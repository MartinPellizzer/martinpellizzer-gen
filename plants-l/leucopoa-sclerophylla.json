    "intro": "Leucopoa sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved flax, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, semi-arid environments."
