    "intro": "Lippia cordata, commonly known as Mexican mint or blue mist shrub, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring aromatic, narrow leaves with a mint-like scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the branches. Lippia cordata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens and landscapes."
