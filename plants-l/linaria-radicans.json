    "intro": "Linaria radicans, commonly known as the creeping toadflax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Linaria radicans is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
