    "intro": "Lindsaea repanda, commonly known as the hairy staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, staghorn-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Lindsaea repanda is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
