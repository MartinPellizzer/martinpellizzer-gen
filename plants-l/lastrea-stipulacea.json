    "intro": "Lastrea stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule leaf cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and small, spineless leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Lastrea stipulacea is well adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
