    "intro": "Lomariopsis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf lomariopsis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive with indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, well-drained soil, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
