    "intro": "Loreya umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feathery fronds. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow inflorescences that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. Loreya umbellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
