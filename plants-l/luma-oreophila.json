    "intro": "Luma oreophila, commonly known as the cloud forest luma, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of cloud forests. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Due to its restricted habitat, Luma oreophila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
