    "intro": "Lycopodium verticillatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often form whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lycopodium verticillatum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
