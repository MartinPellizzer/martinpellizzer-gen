    "intro": "Lappula platycantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule, which aids in wind dispersal. Lappula platycantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
