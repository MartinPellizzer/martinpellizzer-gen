    "intro": "Lepidium desertorum, commonly known as desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lepidium desertorum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
