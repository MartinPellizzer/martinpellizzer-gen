    "intro": "Limonium \u00d7 pseudodivaricatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Limonium \u00d7 pseudodivaricatum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to coastal winds and salt spray."
