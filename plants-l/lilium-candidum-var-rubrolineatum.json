    "intro": "Lilium candidum var. rubrolineatum, commonly known as the red-lined white lily, is a rare and striking variant of the white lily. It is characterized by its pale white petals adorned with deep red veins, creating a dramatic visual contrast. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces large, fragrant flowers in late spring. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
