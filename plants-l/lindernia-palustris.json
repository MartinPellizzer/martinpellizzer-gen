    "intro": "Lindernia palustris, commonly known as the marsh lindernia, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, supporting opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Lindernia palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
