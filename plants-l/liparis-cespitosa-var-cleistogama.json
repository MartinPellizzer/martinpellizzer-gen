    "intro": "Liparis cespitosa var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances seed production in less favorable conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, lacking the showy colors of many other orchid species. This variant is notable for its adaptation to low-light environments and its role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
