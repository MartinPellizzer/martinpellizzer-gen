    "intro": "Lycopodioides portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Lycopodioides portoricensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
