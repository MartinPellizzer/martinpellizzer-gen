It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species that are often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, yellow, or red in color. Lydenburgia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. They play an important ecological role in their native environments by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
