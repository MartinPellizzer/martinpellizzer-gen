    "intro": "Luzula hyperborea var. minor, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude and arctic regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures remain low year-round. Due to its specialized habitat, it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of these extreme environments."
