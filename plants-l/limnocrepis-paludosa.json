    "intro": "Limnocrepis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Limnocrepis paludosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
