    "intro": "Lachnagrostis aemula, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
