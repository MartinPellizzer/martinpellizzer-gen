It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to violet flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
