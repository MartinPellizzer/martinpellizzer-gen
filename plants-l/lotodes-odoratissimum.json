    "intro": "Lotodes odoratissimum, commonly known as the fragrant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic life. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning, releasing a strong, sweet fragrance. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy bottom substrates of still or slow-moving water bodies. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in water gardens."
