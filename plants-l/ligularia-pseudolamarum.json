    "intro": "Ligularia pseudolamarum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for water gardeners and wetland restoration projects."
