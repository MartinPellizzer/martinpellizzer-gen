It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in forested areas. The botanical features of Leptobalanus calvescens make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
