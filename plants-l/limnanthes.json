    "intro": "Limnanthes, commonly known as the meadow foam, is a genus of flowering plants native to North America. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. They are often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges. Limnanthes species are adapted to moist environments and have specialized structures that help them thrive in such conditions. Their seeds are often dispersed by water, contributing to their ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
