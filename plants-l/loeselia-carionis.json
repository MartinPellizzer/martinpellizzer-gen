It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Loeselia carionis is a perennial herb that produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
