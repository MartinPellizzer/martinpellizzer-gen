    "intro": "Lindera cercidifolia, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Lindera cercidifolia is valued for its seasonal color and ecological benefits, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
