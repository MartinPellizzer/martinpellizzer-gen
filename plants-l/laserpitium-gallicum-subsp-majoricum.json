    "intro": "Laserpitium gallicum subsp. majoricum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, branched inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust flowering structure compared to other members of the species."
