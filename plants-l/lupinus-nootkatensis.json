    "intro": "Lupinus nootkatensis, commonly known as the Alaska lupine, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tundra environments. Lupinus nootkatensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting other plant growth in nutrient-poor areas."
