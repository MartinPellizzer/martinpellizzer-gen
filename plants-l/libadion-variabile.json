    "intro": "Libadion variabile, commonly known as the variable libadion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the genus."
