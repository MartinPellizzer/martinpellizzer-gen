It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Lerchenfeldia uliginosa plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland environment."
