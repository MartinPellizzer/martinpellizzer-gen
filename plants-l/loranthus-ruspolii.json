    "intro": "Loranthus ruspolii, commonly known as the Italian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant forms a dense, evergreen growth with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that aid in seed dispersal. This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its parasitic and mutualistic relationships."
