It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for garden cultivation."
