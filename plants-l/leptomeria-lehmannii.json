It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often with a striking coloration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
