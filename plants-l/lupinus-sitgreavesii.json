    "intro": "Lupinus sitgreavesii, commonly known as Sitgreaves lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers. It is part of the legume family, which allows it to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
