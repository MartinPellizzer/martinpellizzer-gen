    "intro": "Limonium chrysocephalum, commonly known as goldenhead sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Limonium chrysocephalum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
