    "intro": "Lysimachia lunellii, commonly known as the moonflower or lunar willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of stars. The plant has thin, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rocks. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia lunellii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
