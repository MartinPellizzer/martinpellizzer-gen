It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is native to regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
