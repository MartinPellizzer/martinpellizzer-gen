    "intro": "Loxanthocereus multifloccosus, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces fleshy, red fruits that are edible and contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and relying on nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense colonies in well-drained soils."
