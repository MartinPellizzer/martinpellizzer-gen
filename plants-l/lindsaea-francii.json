    "intro": "Lindsaea francii, commonly known as the French lindsaea, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with long, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Lindsaea francii is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
