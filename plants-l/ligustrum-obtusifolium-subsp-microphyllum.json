It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
