This plant is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, papery texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the leaves. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
