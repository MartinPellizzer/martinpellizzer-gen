    "intro": "Lupinus reineckianus, commonly known as the Reinecke's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus reineckianus is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
