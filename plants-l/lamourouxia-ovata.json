    "intro": "Lamourouxia ovata, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic animals such as water fleas. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
