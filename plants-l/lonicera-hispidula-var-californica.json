It features slender, woody stems that often have a reddish or purplish hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
