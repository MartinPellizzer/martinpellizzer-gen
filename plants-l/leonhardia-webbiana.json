    "intro": "Leonhardia webbiana, commonly known as the webb's leonhardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
