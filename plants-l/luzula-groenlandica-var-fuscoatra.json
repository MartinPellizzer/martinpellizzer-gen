    "intro": "Luzula groenlandica var. fuscoatra, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of dense trichomes. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
