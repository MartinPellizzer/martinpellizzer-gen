    "intro": "Lolium perenne subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, upright stems that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
