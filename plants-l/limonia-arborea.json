It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Limonia arborea thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental and subtropical gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its popularity in horticulture."
