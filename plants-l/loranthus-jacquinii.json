    "intro": "Loranthus jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Its growth is often limited by the availability of suitable host trees and environmental conditions."
