    "intro": "Lycurus, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is toxic to many animals. Lycurus typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and roadsides. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host for their larvae."
