This variant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its ornamental value and unique blooming habits, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in suitable climates."
