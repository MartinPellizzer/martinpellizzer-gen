    "intro": "Linaria elatinoides, commonly known as the sand linaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Linaria elatinoides is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
