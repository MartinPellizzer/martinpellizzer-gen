    "intro": "Limonium britannicum var. kelseyanum, commonly known as the Kelseyan sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern England. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal habitats where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune environments."
