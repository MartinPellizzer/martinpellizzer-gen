    "intro": "Lantana trifolia f. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which gives it its specific epithet \"oppositifolia.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in certain regions, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
