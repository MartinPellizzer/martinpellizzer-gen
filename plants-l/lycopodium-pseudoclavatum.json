    "intro": "Lycopodium pseudoclavatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spore-producing organs. Lycopodium pseudoclavatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
