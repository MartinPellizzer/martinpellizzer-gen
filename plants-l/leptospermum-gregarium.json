    "intro": "Leptospermum gregarium, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
