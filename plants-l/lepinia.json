    "intro": "Lepinia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plants typically have evergreen leaves that are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating. Lepinia species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the spring. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in rock gardens and as border plants."
