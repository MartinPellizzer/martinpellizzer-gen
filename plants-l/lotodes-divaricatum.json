    "intro": "Lotodes divaricatum, commonly known as the broadleaf water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive cup-like structure that holds water. The roots of Lotodes divaricatum help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
