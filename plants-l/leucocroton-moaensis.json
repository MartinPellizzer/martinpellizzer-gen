    "intro": "Leucocroton moaensis, commonly known as the Maori's glory, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or orange center. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the native honeyeaters. Due to habitat loss and historical over-collection, it is now considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
