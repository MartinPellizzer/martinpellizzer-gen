It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. It has fibrous roots and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
