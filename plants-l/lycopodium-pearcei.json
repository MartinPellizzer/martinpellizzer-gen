    "intro": "Lycopodium pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Lycopodium pearcei typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soil conditions."
