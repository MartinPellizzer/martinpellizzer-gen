    "intro": "Lactuca matsumurae, commonly known as Japanese lettuce or mountain lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Lactuca matsumurae is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical properties remain understudied compared to more common lettuce species."
