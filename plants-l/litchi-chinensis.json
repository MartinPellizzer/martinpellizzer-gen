    "intro": "Litchi chinensis, commonly known as the litchi or lychee, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern China. It produces small, hairy fruits that turn red when ripe, with a thick, rough skin enclosing a sweet, white, and juicy aril. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are fragrant and typically appear before the fruiting season. The botanical features of Litchi chinensis make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
