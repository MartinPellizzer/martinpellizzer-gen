It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking yellow-green in color. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are predominantly yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
