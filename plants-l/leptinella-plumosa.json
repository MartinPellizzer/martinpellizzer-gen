    "intro": "Leptinella plumosa, commonly known as the downy leptinella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
