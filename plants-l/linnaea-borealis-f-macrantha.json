    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The flowers are typically larger than those of the typical species, hence the name \"macrantha,\" which refers to large flowers. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
