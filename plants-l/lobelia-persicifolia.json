    "intro": "Lobelia persicifolia, commonly known as the peach-leaved lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Lobelia persicifolia is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
