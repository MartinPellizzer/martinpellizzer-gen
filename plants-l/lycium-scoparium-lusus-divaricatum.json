    "intro": "Lycium scoparium lusus divaricatum, commonly known as the variable thorny boxwood, is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery in texture. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is native to parts of southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and hedge planting."
