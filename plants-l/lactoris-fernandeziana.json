    "intro": "Lactoris fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's lactoris, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky coastal areas or in humid microhabitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
