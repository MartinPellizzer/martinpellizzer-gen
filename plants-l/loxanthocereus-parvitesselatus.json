It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a shallow root system to thrive in sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
