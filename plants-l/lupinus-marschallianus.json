    "intro": "Lupinus marschallianus, commonly known as the marshmallow lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces fluffy, pod-like seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Lupinus marschallianus plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
