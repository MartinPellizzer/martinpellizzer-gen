    "intro": "Lalldhwojia, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow during twilight hours. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its unique fragrance, often described as a blend of jasmine and night-blooming flowers, attracts nocturnal pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Lalldhwojia is considered a symbol of mystery and resilience in botanical circles."
