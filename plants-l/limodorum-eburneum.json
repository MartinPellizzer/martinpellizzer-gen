    "intro": "Limodorum eburneum, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the forests of Europe. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
