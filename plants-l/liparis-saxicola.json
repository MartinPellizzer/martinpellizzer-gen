    "intro": "Liparis saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to arid and rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Liparis saxicola is often found in limestone areas and is valued for its resilience and unique floral structure."
