    "intro": "Landoltia, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and yellow flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. Landoltia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration. The genus includes several species, with Landoltia biflora being one of the most widely recognized."
