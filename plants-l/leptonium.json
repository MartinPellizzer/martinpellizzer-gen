    "intro": "Leptonium, commonly known as the common leptonium, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Leptonium species are native to various regions in Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They are not widely cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological roles."
