    "intro": "Lasipana tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves with a distinctive three-lobed shape and a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life."
