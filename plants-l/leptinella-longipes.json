    "intro": "Leptinella longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
