    "intro": "Linum lanuginosum, commonly known as silky flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Linum lanuginosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in textile production."
