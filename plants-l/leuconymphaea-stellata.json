It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Leuconymphaea stellata plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity."
