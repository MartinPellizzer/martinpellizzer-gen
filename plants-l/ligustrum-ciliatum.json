    "intro": "Ligustrum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky privet, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically grayish-green with fine hairs along the edges, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant in landscapes. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
