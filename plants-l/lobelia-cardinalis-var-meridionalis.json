    "intro": "Lobelia cardinalis var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern cardinalflower, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Lobelia cardinalis, but it is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution."
