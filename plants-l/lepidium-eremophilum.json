    "intro": "Lepidium eremophilum, commonly known as desert rocket, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or divided. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lepidium eremophilum is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in gravelly soils along rocky slopes and in desert scrub habitats."
