    "intro": "Lavandula galgalloensis, commonly known as the Galgalloan lavender, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Lavandula genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces spikes of small, fragrant purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, typical of many lavender species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
