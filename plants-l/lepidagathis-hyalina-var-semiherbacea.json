    "intro": "Lepidagathis hyalina var. semiherbacea, commonly known as the glassy lepidagathis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are typically white or pale green, with a delicate appearance. This variant is distinguished by its semiherbaceous nature, which means it has some woody characteristics compared to the fully herbaceous form of the species."
