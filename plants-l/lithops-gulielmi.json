    "intro": "Lithops gulielmi, commonly known as the \"Guelich's ice plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paired leaves that resemble stones, which help it blend into its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Lithops gulielmi is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
