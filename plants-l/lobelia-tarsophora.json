    "intro": "Lobelia tarsophora, commonly known as the rock lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in dry conditions. Lobelia tarsophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
