    "intro": "Lophiolepis fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on rocks or tree bark. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with a finely granular surface texture. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Lophiolepis fominii plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
