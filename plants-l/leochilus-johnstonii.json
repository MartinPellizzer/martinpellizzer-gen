    "intro": "Leochilus johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's leechgrass, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species within its native range."
