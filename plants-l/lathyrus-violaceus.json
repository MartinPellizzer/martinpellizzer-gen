    "intro": "Lathyrus violaceus, commonly known as violet pea or blue pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its seeds are encased in a leathery pod, and the plant is often grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than its edibility. Lathyrus violaceus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
