    "intro": "Lycopodium tuberosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright, spore-bearing cones. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its sporophyte generation dominates the life cycle, with the gametophyte being short-lived and dependent on the sporophyte. Lycopodium tuberosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
