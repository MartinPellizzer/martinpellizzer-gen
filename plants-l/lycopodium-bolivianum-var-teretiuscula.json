    "intro": "Lycopodium bolivianum var. teretiuscula, commonly known as the Bolivian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and is often found in the Andean regions of South America."
