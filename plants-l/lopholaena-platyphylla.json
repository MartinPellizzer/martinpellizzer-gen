    "intro": "Lopholaena platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed lopholaena, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Lopholaena platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
