It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers bloom in early spring, forming in clusters at the base of the stems. The plant is notable for its unique leaf arrangement and its role in supporting local pollinators."
