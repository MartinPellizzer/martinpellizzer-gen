    "intro": "Leontopodium jacotianum var. minum, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
