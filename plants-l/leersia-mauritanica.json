    "intro": "Leersia mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Leersia mauritanica is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
