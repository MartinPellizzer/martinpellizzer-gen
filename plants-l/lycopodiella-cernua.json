    "intro": "Lycopodiella cernua, commonly known as the drooping clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and possesses microphylls, which are simple, needle-like leaves typical of ancient plant groups. Lycopodiella cernua thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
