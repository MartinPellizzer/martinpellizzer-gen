    "intro": "Lemaireocereus martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, a characteristic typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils in desert regions. Lemaireocereus martinezii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions with minimal care."
