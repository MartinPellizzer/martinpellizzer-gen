    "intro": "Lagonychium farctum, commonly known as the fat-leafed orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Lagonychium farctum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
