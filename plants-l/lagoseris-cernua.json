    "intro": "Lagoseris cernua, commonly known as the prostrate sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Lagoseris cernua is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and coastal areas."
