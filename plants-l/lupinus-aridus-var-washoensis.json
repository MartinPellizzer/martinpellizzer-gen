    "intro": "Lupinus aridus var. washoensis, commonly known as the Wasatch lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
