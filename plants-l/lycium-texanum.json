    "intro": "Lycium texanum, commonly known as the Texas boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange-red berries that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Lycium texanum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
