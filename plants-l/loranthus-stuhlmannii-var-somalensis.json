    "intro": "Loranthus stuhlmannii var. somalensis, commonly known as the Somali mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is native to the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees."
