    "intro": "Lycopodioides orbigniana, commonly known as the Orbignya lycopodioides, is a species of cycad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
