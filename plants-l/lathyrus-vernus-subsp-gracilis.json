    "intro": "Lathyrus vernus subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
