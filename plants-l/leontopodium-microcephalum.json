    "intro": "Leontopodium microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf edelweiss, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in harsh environments with strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and a popular subject in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a conservation concern in some areas."
