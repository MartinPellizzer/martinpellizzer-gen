    "intro": "Lagerstroemia intermedia var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblongleaf crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bark is smooth and mottled, adding visual interest throughout the year."
