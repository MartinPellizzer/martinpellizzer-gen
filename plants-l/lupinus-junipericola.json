    "intro": "Lupinus junipericola, commonly known as the juniper lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Lupinus junipericola plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
