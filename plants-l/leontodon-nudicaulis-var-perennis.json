    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis var. perennis, commonly known as the perennial hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that attract various pollinators."
