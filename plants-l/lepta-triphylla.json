    "intro": "Lepta triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved mountain-mahoe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
