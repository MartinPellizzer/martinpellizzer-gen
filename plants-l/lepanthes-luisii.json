    "intro": "Lepanthes luisii, commonly known as the Luis's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes luisii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
