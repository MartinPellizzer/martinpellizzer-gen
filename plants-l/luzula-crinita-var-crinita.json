    "intro": "Luzula crinita var. crinita, commonly known as the silky woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and not showy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense mats. Luzula crinita var. crinita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
