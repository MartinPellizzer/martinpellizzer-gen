It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cool, shaded environments, typically found in boreal and subarctic regions. The plant features delicate, opposite leaves and small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its unique floral structure and subtle beauty make it a notable subject in botanical studies. This form is less common than the typical Linnaea borealis, highlighting the genetic diversity within the species."
