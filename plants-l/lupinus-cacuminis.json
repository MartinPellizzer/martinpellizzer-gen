    "intro": "Lupinus cacuminis, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus cacuminis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
