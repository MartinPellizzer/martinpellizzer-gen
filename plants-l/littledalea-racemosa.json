    "intro": "Littledalea racemosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in dense, racemose clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Littledalea racemosa is valued for its resilience and is often found in high-elevation meadows and slopes."
