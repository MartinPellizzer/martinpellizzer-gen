    "intro": "Lychnis kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kivu mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Eastern African region, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
