    "intro": "Lactuca orientalis subsp. nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically broad and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that bloom in the summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
