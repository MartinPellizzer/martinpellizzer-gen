    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. uliginosus, commonly known as the marsh trefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
