    "intro": "Liquidambar maximowiczii, commonly known as the Chinese sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the genus Liquidambar in the family Aceraceae, though it is now classified under the family Sapindaceae. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a spiky, spherical capsule that splits to release samaras, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage."
