    "intro": "Lycopodium hellwigii, commonly known as the Hellwig's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves that form dense, compact foliage. Native to the southeastern United States, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Lycopodium hellwigii is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of hardwood forests. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are clustered at the tips of its branches and play a key role in its life cycle."
