    "intro": "Lobirota pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lobirota, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Lobirota pyrenaica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
