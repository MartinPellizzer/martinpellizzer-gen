    "intro": "Lepidium pratense subsp. reverchonii, commonly known as the slender peppergrass, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods that release tiny seeds when mature."
