    "intro": "Lambertia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal lambertia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive red, lantern-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Lambertia ilicifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
