    "intro": "Lobelia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Lobelia platyphylla is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
