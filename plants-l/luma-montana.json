    "intro": "Luma montana, commonly known as the mountain luma, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract various bird species. This plant is well adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters."
