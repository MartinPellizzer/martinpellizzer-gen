    "intro": "Limnorchis brevifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater wetlands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Limnorchis brevifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
