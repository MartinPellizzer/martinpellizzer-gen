    "intro": "Ludovicea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Ludovicea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and for their hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now considered threatened or endangered."
