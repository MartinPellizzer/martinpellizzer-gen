    "intro": "Lepidium lasiocarpum var. georginum, commonly known as the Georgina cress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, lobed capsule, a feature that distinguishes it from other varieties of Lepidium. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
