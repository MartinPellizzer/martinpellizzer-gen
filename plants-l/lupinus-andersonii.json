    "intro": "Lupinus andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus andersonii is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
