    "intro": "Linaria arvensis subsp. euarvensis, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny toads, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies euarvensis is distinguished by its more robust growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to other subspecies of Linaria arvensis."
