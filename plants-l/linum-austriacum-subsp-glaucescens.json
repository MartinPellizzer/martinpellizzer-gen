    "intro": "Linum austriacum subsp. glaucescens, commonly known as Austrian flax, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its fibrous stems are used for fiber production, similar to common flax."
