    "intro": "Lupinus glacialis, commonly known as the glacier lupin, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant produces clusters of pea-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus glacialis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
