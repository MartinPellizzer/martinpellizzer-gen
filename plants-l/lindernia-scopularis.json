    "intro": "Lindernia scopularis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Lindernia scopularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
