    "intro": "Lupinus proteanus, commonly known as the Cape lupin, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its erect, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces fluffy, pod-like seedpods that contain several seeds. Lupinus proteanus is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
