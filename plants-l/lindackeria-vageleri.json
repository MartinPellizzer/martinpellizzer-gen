    "intro": "Lindackeria vageleri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in its native range."
