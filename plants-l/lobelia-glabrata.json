    "intro": "Lobelia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves which are lance-shaped and smooth to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
