    "intro": "Lactuca canadensis f. angustipes, commonly known as narrow-leaved Canadian lettuce, is a variant of the common lettuce species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically more upright than those of the standard variety. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a potential forage plant. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
