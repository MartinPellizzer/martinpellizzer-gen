    "intro": "Leptospermum morrisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
