    "intro": "Lamprotis modesta, commonly known as the modest orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
