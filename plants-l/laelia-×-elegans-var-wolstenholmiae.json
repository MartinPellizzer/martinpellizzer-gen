    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 elegans var. wolstenholmiae, commonly known as the Wolstenholme's Laelia, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude, cool climates. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss in its native environment. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and resilience in cultivation."
