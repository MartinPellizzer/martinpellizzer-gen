    "intro": "Limonium carinense, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and unique appearance. Limonium carinense thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along dunes and rocky shores."
