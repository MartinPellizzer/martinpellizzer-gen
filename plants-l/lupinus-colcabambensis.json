    "intro": "Lupinus colcabambensis, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a species native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lupinus colcabambensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its presence in alpine ecosystems highlights its ecological importance in nutrient-poor soils."
