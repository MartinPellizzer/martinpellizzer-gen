    "intro": "Libidibia corymbosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, flat seeds. Due to overharvesting, Libidibia corymbosa is considered an endangered species in many regions."
