    "intro": "Lipschitziella carduicephala, commonly known as the carduicephalum lipschitzii, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
