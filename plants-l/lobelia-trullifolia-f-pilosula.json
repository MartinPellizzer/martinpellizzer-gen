    "intro": "Lobelia trullifolia f. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its showy blue to purple flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are also hairy, contributing to its distinct botanical appearance."
