    "intro": "Lupinus luteus subvar. leucospermus, commonly known as the white-flowered lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of pea-like flowers, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats."
