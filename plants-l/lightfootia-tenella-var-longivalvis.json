    "intro": "Lightfootia tenella var. longivalvis, commonly known as the longivalve lightfootia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
