    "intro": "Leptochiton quitoensis, commonly known as the Quito sea snail, is a species of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Lepetodrilidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated shell that is typically pale in color with intricate, fine patterns. This species is native to the intertidal zones of the Pacific coast, particularly around Ecuador. The shell is often covered in a layer of calcareous sediment, which helps protect it from predation and environmental stress. Leptochiton quitoensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger marine organisms."
