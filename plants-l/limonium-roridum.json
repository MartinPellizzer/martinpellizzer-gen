    "intro": "Limonium roridum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline conditions. Limonium roridum has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
