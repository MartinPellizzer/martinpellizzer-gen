    "intro": "Leucanthemum depressum, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of western North America. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Leucanthemum depressum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
