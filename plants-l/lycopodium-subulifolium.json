    "intro": "Lycopodium subulifolium, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Lycopodium subulifolium reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
