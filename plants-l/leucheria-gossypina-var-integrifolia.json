    "intro": "Leucheria gossypina var. integrifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the entire plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
