    "intro": "Lathyrus magellanicus var. araucanus, commonly known as the Araucanian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
