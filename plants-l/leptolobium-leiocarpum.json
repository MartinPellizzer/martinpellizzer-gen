    "intro": "Leptolobium leiocarpum, commonly known as the silky lichenwood, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clustered, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, where it forms dense shrubs. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody pods, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils through its extensive root system. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
