    "intro": "Leptocereus paniculatus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern."
