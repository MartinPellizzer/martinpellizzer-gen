    "intro": "Lathyrus filiformis var. ensifolius, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a climbing legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, twining stems and pinnately compound leaves with slender, elongated leaflets. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet, arranged in racemes, and are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and can be a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
