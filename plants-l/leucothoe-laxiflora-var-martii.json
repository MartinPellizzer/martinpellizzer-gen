    "intro": "Leucothoe laxiflora var. martii, commonly known as the Appalachian leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, evergreen foliage that turns bronze in the fall, with small, white, bell-shaped flowers appearing in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. The varietal form, martii, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flower structure compared to the typical variety."
