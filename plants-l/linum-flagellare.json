    "intro": "Linum flagellare, commonly known as the slender flax, is a flowering plant belonging to the Linaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces slender, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Linum flagellare is characterized by its fibrous stems, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other flax species, particularly in its growth habit and floral structure."
