    "intro": "Leptorkis biloba, commonly known as the bilobed lichen, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive two-lobed thallus structure. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a leathery, crust-like appearance with a pale to dark green coloration. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Leptorkis biloba is often used as an indicator species for assessing environmental health."
