It is a low-growing perennial that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers resembling those of the common toadflax. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
