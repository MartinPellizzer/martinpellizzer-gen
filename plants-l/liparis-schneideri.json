    "intro": "Liparis schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
