    "intro": "Linum virgultorum, commonly known as wild flax, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the genus Linum in the family Fabaceae, which includes other legumes. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds of Linum virgultorum are small and contain oils similar to those found in cultivated flax, making it of interest for both ecological and potential agricultural studies."
