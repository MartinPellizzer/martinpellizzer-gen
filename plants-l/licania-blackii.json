    "intro": "Licania blackii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of tropical South America, particularly Brazil and northern Peru. This plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. It also has specialized root systems that filter out salt from the water it absorbs. Licania blackii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
