    "intro": "Lepidosperma neesii var. quadrangulatum, commonly known as the quadrangular sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth and distinctive quadrangular stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it thrives in wetland or swampy environments. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
