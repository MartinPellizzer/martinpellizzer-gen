It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
