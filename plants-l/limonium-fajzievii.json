    "intro": "Limonium fajzievii, commonly known as the Fajziev's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often resembling a cluster of small bells. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to saline environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Limonium fajzievii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal gardens."
