    "intro": "Lamium maculatum var. crenatum, commonly known as the spotted deadnettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish mottling, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to spread through rhizomes."
