    "intro": "Lycopodium campestre, commonly known as the field clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing cones called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium campestre plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
