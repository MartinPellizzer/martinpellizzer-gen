    "intro": "Lilium longiflorum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin lily, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Easter lily. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with distinctive pink or red margins that contrast with the pure white petals. The plant features long, slender stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in horticultural diversity within the Liliaceae family."
