    "intro": "Lathyrus montanus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate pea vine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, trailing stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
