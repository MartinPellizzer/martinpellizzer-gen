    "intro": "Lonchophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Lonchophyllum species are typically herbaceous or semi-woody plants that can grow as shrubs or climbers. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are often yellow or orange in color."
