    "intro": "Lannea acidissima, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a medium to large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and large, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in rocky soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. Lannea acidissima is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
