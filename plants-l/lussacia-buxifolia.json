    "intro": "Lussacia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf lussacia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
