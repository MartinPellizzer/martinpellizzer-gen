    "intro": "Lepicystis squamata, commonly known as the scaly lepicystis, is a small, perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves covered in fine, scaly textures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or white. Lepicystis squamata is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid regions."
