    "intro": "Lepechinia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved lepechinia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to ovate leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
