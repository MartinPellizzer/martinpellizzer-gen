    "intro": "Lobelia campanulata, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
