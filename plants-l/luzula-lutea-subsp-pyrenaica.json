    "intro": "Luzula lutea subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
