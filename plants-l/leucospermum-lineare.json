    "intro": "Leucospermum lineare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved firewheel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright orange or red flowers that resemble wheels. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Leucospermum lineare is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
