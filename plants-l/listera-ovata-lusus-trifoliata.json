    "intro": "Listera ovata lusus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed basket flower, is a rare variant of the basket flower species. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to taxonomists and botanists."
