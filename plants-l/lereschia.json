    "intro": "Lereschia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture. Lereschia species often have strikingly colored flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, making them popular houseplants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
