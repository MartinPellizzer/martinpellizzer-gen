    "intro": "Lycium vulgare var. barbarum, commonly known as the common boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, red or yellow berries that appear in late summer. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces yellow flowers that are often clustered together. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environments. The berries are edible but can be bitter, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
