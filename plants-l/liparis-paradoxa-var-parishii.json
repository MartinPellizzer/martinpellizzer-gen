    "intro": "Liparis paradoxa var. parishii, commonly known as the Paradox Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pale green or yellow with red or purple markings. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its botanical features include long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
