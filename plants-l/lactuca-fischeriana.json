    "intro": "Lactuca fischeriana, commonly known as Fischer's lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and basal rosettes of elongated, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, followed by oval, hairy seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Lactuca fischeriana is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
