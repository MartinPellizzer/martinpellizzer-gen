    "intro": "Landolphia kilimandjarica, commonly known as the giant African water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the lakes of East Africa. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching several meters in diameter. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the lake bed. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can significantly impact local ecosystems."
