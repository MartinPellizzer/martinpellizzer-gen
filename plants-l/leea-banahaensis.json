    "intro": "Leea banahaensis, commonly known as the Banah Valley Leea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are often borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
