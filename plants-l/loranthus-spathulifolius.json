    "intro": "Loranthus spathulifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to its host tree through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grows on the branches of broad-leaved evergreen trees. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
