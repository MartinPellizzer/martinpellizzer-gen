    "intro": "Listera cordata f. trifolia, commonly known as the trifoliate basketstar, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
