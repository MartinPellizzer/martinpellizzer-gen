    "intro": "Ligusticum canadense, commonly known as Canadian angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to North America. It features a tall, hollow stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Ligusticum canadense thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
