It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Linum glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
