    "intro": "Lessertia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping lessertia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers during the late winter to early spring season. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
