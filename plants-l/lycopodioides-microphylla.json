    "intro": "Lycopodioides microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Lycopodioides microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
