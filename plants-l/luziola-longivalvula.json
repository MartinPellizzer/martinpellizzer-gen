    "intro": "Luziola longivalvula, commonly known as the narrow-valved larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats. Luziola longivalvula is known for its ornamental value but also contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
