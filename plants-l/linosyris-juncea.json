    "intro": "Linosyris juncea, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is an annual herb that grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Linosyris juncea is adapted to salt spray and is an important part of the coastal ecosystem."
