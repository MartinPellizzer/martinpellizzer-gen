    "intro": "Lomaria neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of bright yellow or orange blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
