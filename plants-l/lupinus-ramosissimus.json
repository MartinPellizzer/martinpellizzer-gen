    "intro": "Lupinus ramosissimus, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tall, branched stems that support clusters of pea-like blue to purple flowers. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Lupinus ramosissimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including supporting pollinators."
