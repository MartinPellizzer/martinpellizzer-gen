    "intro": "Lomatium argense, commonly known as the silverleaf lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Lomatium argense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
