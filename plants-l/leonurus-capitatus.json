    "intro": "Leonurus capitatus, commonly known as the clustered hedgehog or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats. It thrives in dry, open areas such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of study in ecological research."
