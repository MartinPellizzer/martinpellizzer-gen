    "intro": "Lycopodium verticillatum var. apertum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems, a feature that distinguishes it from other clubmoss species. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
