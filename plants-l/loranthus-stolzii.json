    "intro": "Loranthus stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth with small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
