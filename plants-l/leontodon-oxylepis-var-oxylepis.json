It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
