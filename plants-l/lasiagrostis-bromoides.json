    "intro": "Lasiagrostis bromoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lasiagrostis bromoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
