It features dense clusters of small, spiky, needle-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
