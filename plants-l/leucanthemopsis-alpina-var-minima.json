    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis alpina var. minima, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a small, perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in alpine gardens."
