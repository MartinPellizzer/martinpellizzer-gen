    "intro": "Leptocarpus peronatus, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a creeping growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes or shores. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
