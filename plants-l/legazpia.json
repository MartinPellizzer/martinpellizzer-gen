It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that grow from a bulbous underground stem. Legazpia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and eye-catching blooms. However, it should be handled with care, as its sap can be toxic to humans and animals."
