    "intro": "Lycopodioides minima, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged around its stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Lycopodioides minima typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
