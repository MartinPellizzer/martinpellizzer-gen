    "intro": "Limnanthemum ecklonianum, commonly known as the African water lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with a waxy upper surface and a spongy underside for buoyancy. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is often used in aquatic gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
