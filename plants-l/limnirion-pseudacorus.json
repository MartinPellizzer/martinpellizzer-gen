    "intro": "Limnirion pseudacorus, commonly known as the false water plantain, is a wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, often appearing in shades of green or brown. Limnirion pseudacorus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
