    "intro": "Lotus aristatus, commonly known as the slender water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces white or pink flowers with showy petals and a central cluster of stamens. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Lotus aristatus is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional use in herbal medicine."
