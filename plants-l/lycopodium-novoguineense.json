    "intro": "Lycopodium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and primitive vascular plants. Lycopodium novoguineense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology and reproductive strategies reflect its evolutionary adaptation to humid, forested habitats."
