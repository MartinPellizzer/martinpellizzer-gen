    "intro": "Lygodium intermedium, commonly known as the common climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds and a unique climbing habit, utilizing its specialized aerial roots to attach to trees and other structures. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a decorative plant."
