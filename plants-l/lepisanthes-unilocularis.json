It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Lepisanthes unilocularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
