    "intro": "Lagotis kunawurensis, commonly known as the Kunawurensis bellflower, is an endemic plant species native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
