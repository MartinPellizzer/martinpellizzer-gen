    "intro": "Lomaria pectinata, commonly known as the white sand lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Lomaria pectinata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low rainfall."
