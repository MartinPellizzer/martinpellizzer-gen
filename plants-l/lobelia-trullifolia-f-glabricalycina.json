    "intro": "Lobelia trullifolia f. glabricalycina, commonly known as the glabrous-leaved lobelia, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The foliage is notably smooth and lacks the typical hairy texture found in many other lobelia species. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
