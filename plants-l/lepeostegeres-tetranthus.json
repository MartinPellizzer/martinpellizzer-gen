    "intro": "Lepeostegeres tetranthus, commonly known as the four-angled grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Lepeostegeres tetranthus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
