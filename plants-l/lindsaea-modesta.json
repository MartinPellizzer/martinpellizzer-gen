    "intro": "Lindsaea modesta, commonly known as the modest lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are found on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces both spores and, in some cases, small, clustered roots. Lindsaea modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
