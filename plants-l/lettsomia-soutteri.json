It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery growth form. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular surface texture. It thrives on calcareous substrates such as rocks and tree bark. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
