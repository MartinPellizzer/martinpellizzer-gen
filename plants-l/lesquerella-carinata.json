    "intro": "Lesquerella carinata, commonly known as the rough-seeded lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsules that contain oily seeds, which are rich in erucic acid and used in industrial applications. Lesquerella carinata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and potential biotechnological uses."
