It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. Its cones are small and woody, typically maturing to a reddish-brown color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
