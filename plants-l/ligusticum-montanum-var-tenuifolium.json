    "intro": "Ligusticum montanum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved lovage, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with slender, linear lobes that give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued both for its ecological role and traditional uses."
