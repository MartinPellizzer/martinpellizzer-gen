    "intro": "Ledebouria macowanii, commonly known as the Cape mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, sunny environment. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
