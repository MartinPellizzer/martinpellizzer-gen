    "intro": "Laurus caudata, commonly known as the Brazilian Laurel or Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and have a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Laurus caudata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Its essential oils are used in perfumery and traditional medicine for their antiseptic and stimulant effects."
