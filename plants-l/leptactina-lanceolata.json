    "intro": "Leptactina lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color, and it often grows on bark or stone in shaded, humid environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator species for air quality. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable component of ecological studies."
