    "intro": "Logania fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered logania, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
