    "intro": "Lastrea aspidioides, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil. The rock fig is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
