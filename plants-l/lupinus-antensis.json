    "intro": "Lupinus antensis, commonly known as the Anticosti lupine, is a flowering plant native to the island of Anticosti in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth and spiny stems. The plant produces showy, blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in sandy, acidic soils. Lupinus antensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, supporting local biodiversity."
