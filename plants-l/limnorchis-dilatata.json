    "intro": "Limnorchis dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Limnorchis dilatata plays a role in water filtration and serves as a food source for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
