    "intro": "Lotononis decumbens subsp. rehmannii, commonly known as the dwarf silverleaf, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
