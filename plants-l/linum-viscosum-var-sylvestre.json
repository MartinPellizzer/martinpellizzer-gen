    "intro": "Linum viscosum var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild flax, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
