    "intro": "Lycopodioides epirhizon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the forest floor. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as temperate forests and rocky crevices. Lycopodioides epirhizon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
