    "intro": "Lithocardium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lithocardium grandiflorum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
