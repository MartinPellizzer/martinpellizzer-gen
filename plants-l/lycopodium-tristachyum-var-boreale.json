    "intro": "Lycopodium tristachyum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in northern forests and rocky slopes. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other varieties of Lycopodium tristachyum."
