    "intro": "Lantana haughtii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lantana, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, red, or orange, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
