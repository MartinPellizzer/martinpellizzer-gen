    "intro": "Larix cajanderi, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically bright yellow in color and turn golden in the fall. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is lightweight and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. Larix cajanderi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
