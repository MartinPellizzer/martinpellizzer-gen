    "intro": "Lepidium patrinioides, commonly known as the Patrinioides cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
