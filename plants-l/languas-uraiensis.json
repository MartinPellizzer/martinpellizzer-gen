    "intro": "Languas uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraienese Languas, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to vibrant orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and emit a subtle fragrance, especially during the evening. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Languas uraiensis is now considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
