    "intro": "Lemurangis madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar starling, is a small passerine bird native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive black and white plumage, with a striking iridescent sheen. The bird has a slender body, short wings, and a long, slender tail, which aid in its agile flight through the dense forests of its habitat. It primarily feeds on insects, fruits, and nectar, playing a role in seed dispersal and pollination. Lemurangis madagascariensis is typically found in moist evergreen forests and is known for its melodic calls that echo through the canopy."
