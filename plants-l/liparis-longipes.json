    "intro": "Liparis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. Liparis longipes is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitats."
