    "intro": "Leymus angustus var. brevistachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit that helps it survive in harsh environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
