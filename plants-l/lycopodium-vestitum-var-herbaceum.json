    "intro": "Lycopodium vestitum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along streambanks. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to moist, temperate climates."
