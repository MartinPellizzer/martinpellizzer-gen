    "intro": "Lobelia pectinata, commonly known as the sticky lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and whorled leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Lobelia pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
