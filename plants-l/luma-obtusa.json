    "intro": "Luma obtusa, commonly known as the silver birch or white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored bark beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges. Luma obtusa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and adaptable species in temperate climates."
