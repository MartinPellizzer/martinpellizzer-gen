    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana f. cariquinensis, commonly known as the Cariquinensis lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
