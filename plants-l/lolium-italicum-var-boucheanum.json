It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered at the base of the stems, and it is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its adaptability, it is also found in various habitats, including meadows and along stream banks."
