    "intro": "Lagarosiphon major, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It has long, narrow leaves that float on the surface of water or grow submerged, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and can spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
