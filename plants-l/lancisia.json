    "intro": "Lancisia, commonly known as the \"Swordleaf tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plants are characterized by their large, lance-shaped leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. They are typically tree or shrub species that can grow quite tall, with some species reaching heights of over 30 meters. Lancisia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are also used in traditional medicine in some indigenous communities."
