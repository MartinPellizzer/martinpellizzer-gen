    "intro": "Lolium temulentum var. scabrum, commonly known as scabrous ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. While it is not widely cultivated, it has some historical use in livestock feed and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration."
