    "intro": "Lobelia eryliae subsp. eryliae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partly shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
