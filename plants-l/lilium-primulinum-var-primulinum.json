    "intro": "Lilium primulinum var. primulinum, commonly known as the golden cup lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive orange-red throat. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single stem that bears the floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
