    "intro": "Lobivia formosa var. totorensis, commonly known as the Totorensis Lobivia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and ribbed stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
