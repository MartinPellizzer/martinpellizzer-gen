    "intro": "Lobelia macrodon, commonly known as the large-flowered lobelia, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lobelia macrodon is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
