    "intro": "Lycopodium flabelliforme f. proliferum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
