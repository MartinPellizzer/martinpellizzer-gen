    "intro": "Lightfootia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Lightfootia arenaria is often found in dune ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
