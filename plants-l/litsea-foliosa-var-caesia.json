    "intro": "Litsea foliosa var. caesia, commonly known as the blue-leafed litsea, is a variant of the litsea foliosa species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking bluish-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the parent species. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. The flowers are small, white, and clustered, followed by yellowish-orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
