    "intro": "Litosanthes subspicata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
