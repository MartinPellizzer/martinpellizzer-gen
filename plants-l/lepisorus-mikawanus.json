    "intro": "Lepisorus mikawanus, commonly known as the Mikawan fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understoreys. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help in water absorption. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, intricate venation pattern."
