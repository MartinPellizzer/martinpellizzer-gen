    "intro": "Lessingianthus hystricosus, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent central disk and surrounding ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself, it is often used in wildflower mixes and ecological restoration projects."
