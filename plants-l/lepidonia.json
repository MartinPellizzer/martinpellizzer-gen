It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals and prominent stamens, and they bloom in clusters. Lepidonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
