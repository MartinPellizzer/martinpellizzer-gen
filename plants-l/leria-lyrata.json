    "intro": "Leria lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, lyre-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Leria lyrata is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
