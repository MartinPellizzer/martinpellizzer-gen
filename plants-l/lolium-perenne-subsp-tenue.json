    "intro": "Lolium perenne subsp. tenue, commonly known as slender perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for turfgrass and forage. This subspecies is often used in lawns and sports fields due to its durability and ability to withstand foot traffic. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, though it can tolerate some shade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds for propagation."
