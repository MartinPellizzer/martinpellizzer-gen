    "intro": "Lagenaria vulgaris var. hispida, commonly known as the horse-lung or bottle gourd, is a flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, spiny fruit that can vary in shape from spherical to elongated. The plant is native to Africa and is widely cultivated for its edible young fruits, which are used in various culinary traditions. The fruit's thick, fibrous rind becomes tough and inedible as it matures. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
