    "intro": "Lathyrus maritimus f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sea pea, is a botanical variant of the coastal Lathyrus maritimus species. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or blue hues of the species. This form thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often growing in saline or well-drained soils. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, elongated pods containing seeds. Its botanical interest lies in its adaptation to maritime conditions and its unique floral coloration."
