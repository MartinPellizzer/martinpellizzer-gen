    "intro": "Lonicera altissima, commonly known as sweetbriar or orange honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Lonicera altissima is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. Its vigorous growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it an invasive species in many regions."
