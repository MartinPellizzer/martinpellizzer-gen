    "intro": "Ligusticum nodiflorum, commonly known as the nodding ligusticum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
