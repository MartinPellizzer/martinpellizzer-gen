    "intro": "Lotus nubicus, commonly known as the desert lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its roots are capable of storing significant amounts of moisture, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. Lotus nubicus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in extreme heat and low water availability."
