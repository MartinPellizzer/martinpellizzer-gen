    "intro": "Lupinus luteus subvar. chloroticus, commonly known as the yellow lupine variant with chlorosis, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive chlorotic (yellowing) leaves, which are a result of genetic or environmental factors affecting chlorophyll production. This subspecies belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
