    "intro": "Lithops lactea, commonly known as the milk stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, paired leaves that store water. The plant produces a single flower stem with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Lithops lactea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and bright sunlight to thrive."
