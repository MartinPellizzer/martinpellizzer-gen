    "intro": "Lachnagrostis robusta, commonly known as the robust hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Lachnagrostis robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
