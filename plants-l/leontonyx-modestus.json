    "intro": "Leontonyx modestus, commonly known as the modest leopard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface with distinctive white or pale spots, giving it a leopard-like appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in various environments. It typically grows on bark, wood, or stone in temperate regions. Leontonyx modestus is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
