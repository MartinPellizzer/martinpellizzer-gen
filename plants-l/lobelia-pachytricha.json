    "intro": "Lobelia pachytricha, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems are a distinguishing characteristic, aiding in water storage. Lobelia pachytricha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
