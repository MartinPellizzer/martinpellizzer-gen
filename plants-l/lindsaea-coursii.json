    "intro": "Lindsaea coursii, commonly known as the Florida lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in humid climates. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Lindsaea coursii is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in wetland or forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
