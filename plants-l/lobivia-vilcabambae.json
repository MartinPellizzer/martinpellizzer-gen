    "intro": "Lobivia vilcabambae, commonly known as the Vilcabamba lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
