    "intro": "Lespedeza shiroyamensis, commonly known as the Japanese lespe deza, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Lespedeza shiroyamensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
