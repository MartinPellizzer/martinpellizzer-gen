    "intro": "Lathyrus pratensis, commonly known as the meadow vetchling, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, dark seeds. Lathyrus pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
