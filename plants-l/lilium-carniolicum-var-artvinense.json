    "intro": "Lilium carniolicum var. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin lily, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. This perennial herbaceous plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
