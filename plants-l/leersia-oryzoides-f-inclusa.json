    "intro": "Leersia oryzoides f. inclusa, commonly known as the broadleaf leersia, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, making it visually distinct from other grasses. This variety is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
