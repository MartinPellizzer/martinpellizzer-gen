    "intro": "Larrea hidalgensis, commonly known as the poor man's pepper or chaparral bush, is a shrub native to the deserts of North America. It belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and aromatic, resinous leaves. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. Larrea hidalgensis is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
