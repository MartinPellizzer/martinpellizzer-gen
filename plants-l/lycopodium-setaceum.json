    "intro": "Lycopodium setaceum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are dispersed by wind, a key feature of its reproductive strategy. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Lycopodium setaceum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
