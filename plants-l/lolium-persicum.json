    "intro": "Lolium persicum, commonly known as Persian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value. Lolium persicum is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
