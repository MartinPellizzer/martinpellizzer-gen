    "intro": "Limonium linifolium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Limonium linifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small insects."
