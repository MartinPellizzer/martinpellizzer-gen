    "intro": "Lemurosicyos variegatus, commonly known as the ghost bean vine, is a climbing plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a striking variegated pattern of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
