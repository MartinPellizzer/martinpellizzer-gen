    "intro": "Luma alpigena, commonly known as the alpine luma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact pattern, adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Luma alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
