    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. luteola, commonly known as the yellow tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are dark green and somewhat fleshy, with a dense, tufted appearance at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is distinguished by its golden-yellow coloration, particularly in the flower heads, which adds to its ornamental value in gardens."
