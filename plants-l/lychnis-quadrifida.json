    "intro": "Lychnis quadrifida, commonly known as the four-lobed catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces four-lobed leaves that are often hairy and arranged opposite along the stem. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Lychnis quadrifida is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
