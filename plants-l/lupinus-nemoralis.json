    "intro": "Lupinus nemoralis, commonly known as the wood lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus nemoralis is often found in woodland edges, heaths, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
