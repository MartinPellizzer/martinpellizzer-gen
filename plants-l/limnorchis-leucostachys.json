    "intro": "Limnorchis leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed water-plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland ecosystems. Limnorchis leucostachys plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
