    "intro": "Lycopodium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and forest floors. Its unique structure and ancient lineage make it an important study in the evolution of vascular plants."
