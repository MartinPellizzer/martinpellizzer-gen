    "intro": "Lantana camara subsp. aculeata, commonly known as the spiked lantana, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and hairy leaves that are often aromatic. It is characterized by its spiny stems and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and is often considered a weed."
