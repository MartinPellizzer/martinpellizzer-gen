    "intro": "Lophostemon depressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
