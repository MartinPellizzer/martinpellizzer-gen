    "intro": "Leptidium, commonly known as bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and fleshy, bladder-like structures on their stems. They are typically found in arctic and alpine regions, thriving in cold, rocky environments. Leptidium species are often used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject in botanical research."
