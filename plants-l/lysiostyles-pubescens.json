    "intro": "Lysiostyles pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lysiostyle, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Lysiostyles pubescens is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
