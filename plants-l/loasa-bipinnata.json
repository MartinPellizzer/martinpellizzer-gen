    "intro": "Loasa bipinnata, commonly known as the goldenbark or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its bark is thick and often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, contributing to its common name. Loasa bipinnata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
