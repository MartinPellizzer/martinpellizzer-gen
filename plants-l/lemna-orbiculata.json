    "intro": "Lemna orbiculata, commonly known as the water clover, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It has tiny, broad, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients directly through its leaf surfaces. It reproduces rapidly by producing tiny tubers that detach and float to new locations. Lemna orbiculata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes."
