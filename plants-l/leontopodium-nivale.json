    "intro": "Leontopodium nivale, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and showy yellow flower heads, which are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, typically at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it is adapted to strong winds and low temperatures. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its striking appearance and association with alpine landscapes, it is often considered a symbol of resilience and beauty in mountainous regions."
