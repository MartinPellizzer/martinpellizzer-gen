    "intro": "Lissochilus malangensis, commonly known as the Malang orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
