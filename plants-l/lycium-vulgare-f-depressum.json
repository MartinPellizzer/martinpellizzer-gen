    "intro": "Lycium vulgare f. depressum, commonly known as the low-growing gooseberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
