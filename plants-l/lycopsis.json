    "intro": "Lycopsis, commonly known as the \"water lily\" or \"lily of the valley,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Liliaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Lycopsis species are often found in moist or shady environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. They have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread vegetatively. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others have historical uses in traditional medicine."
