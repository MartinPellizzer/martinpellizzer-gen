    "intro": "Loranthus celastroides var. longicarpeus, commonly known as the long-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature makes it an important component of forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and biodiversity. The variety is distinguished by its longer, more pronounced fruiting structures compared to other varieties of Loranthus."
