    "intro": "Ligustrum acutissimum, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in horticulture for its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
