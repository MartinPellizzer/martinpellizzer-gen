    "intro": "Lappa glabra, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
