    "intro": "Lindera stewardiana, commonly known as the Steward's woodbine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical features include a woody stem, simple leaves, and a unique reproductive strategy involving both self-pollination and cross-pollination."
