    "intro": "Lilium loddigesianum, commonly known as the Loddiges' lily, is a rare and endangered species native to the wetlands of the Netherlands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and is protected in several botanical gardens and conservation programs."
