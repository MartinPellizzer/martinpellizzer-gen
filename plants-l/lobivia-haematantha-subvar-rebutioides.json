    "intro": "Lobivia haematantha subvar. rebutioides, commonly known as the Rebuttioides lobivia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color, with a tendency to develop a reddish hue when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the cooler months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. This subvariety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
