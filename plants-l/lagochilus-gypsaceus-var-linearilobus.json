    "intro": "Lagochilus gypsaceus var. linearilobus, commonly known as the linear-lipped mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with aromatic, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
