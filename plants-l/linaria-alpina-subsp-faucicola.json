    "intro": "Linaria alpina subsp. faucicola, commonly known as the alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
