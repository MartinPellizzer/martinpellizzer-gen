    "intro": "Lupinus labiatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lupine, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Lupinus labiatus is a valuable plant for soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It is also used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
