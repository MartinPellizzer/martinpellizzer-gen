    "intro": "Lepidaria kingii, commonly known as the King's lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale to dark green or brownish thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
