    "intro": "Lasianthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as tropical forests and is often found near streams or in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
