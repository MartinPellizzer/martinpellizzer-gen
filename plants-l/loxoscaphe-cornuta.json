It is characterized by its crustose growth form and a dark, leathery thallus that adheres tightly to substrates such as bark and stone. The lichen's surface is typically covered with a layer of granules and is often reddish or brown in color. It contains several fungal and algal partners, with the primary alga being Trebouxia, which provides photosynthetic capability. Loxoscaphe cornuta is commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
