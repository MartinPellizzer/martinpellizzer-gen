    "intro": "Lophosoria dorsalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its adaptability and ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
