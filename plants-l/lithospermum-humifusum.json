    "intro": "Lithospermum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping rock pepper, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments. Lithospermum humifusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in rocky habitats."
