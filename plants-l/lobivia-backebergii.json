    "intro": "Lobivia backebergii, commonly known as the Cape rock agave, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
