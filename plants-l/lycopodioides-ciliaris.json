    "intro": "Lycopodioides ciliaris, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in rocky or woodland soils. Lycopodioides ciliaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
