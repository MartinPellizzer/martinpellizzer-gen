The plant has slender, hairy stems that often hang downward, giving it a cascading appearance. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. Linaria pendula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
