    "intro": "Leptoglottis reverchonii, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing in shaded forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
