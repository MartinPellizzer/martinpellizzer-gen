It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
