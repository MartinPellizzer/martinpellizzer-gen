    "intro": "Leucospermum saxatile, commonly known as the rock daisies, is a South African native plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen, providing a contrast to the vibrant floral display. Leucospermum saxatile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
