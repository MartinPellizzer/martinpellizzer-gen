It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique texture and adaptability to well-draining soil and full sun conditions."
