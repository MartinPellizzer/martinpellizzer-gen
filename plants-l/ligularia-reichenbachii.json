    "intro": "Ligularia reichenbachii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in water gardens or bog landscapes. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
