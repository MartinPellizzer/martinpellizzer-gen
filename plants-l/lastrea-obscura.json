    "intro": "Lastrea obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the Appalachian region. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, blooming in late summer. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, Lastrea obscura is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
