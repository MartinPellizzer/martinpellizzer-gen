    "intro": "Leontopodium hayachinense, commonly known as the Japanese edelweiss, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its fragile nature, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
