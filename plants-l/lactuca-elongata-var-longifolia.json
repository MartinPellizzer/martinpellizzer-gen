    "intro": "Lactuca elongata var. longifolia, commonly known as the giant endive, is a cultivated variant of the common endive. It is characterized by its elongated, leafy stems and large, curly leaves that are typically harvested before they fully mature. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are often used in salads and have a slightly bitter taste due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
