    "intro": "Lactuca sylvestris, commonly known as wild lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its latex sap contains compounds like lactucin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Wild lettuce is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its historical use in traditional medicine is linked to its mild sedative and analgesic effects."
