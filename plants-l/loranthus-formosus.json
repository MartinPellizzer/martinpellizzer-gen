    "intro": "Loranthus formosus, commonly known as the Taiwan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the subtropical regions of East Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, which help in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
