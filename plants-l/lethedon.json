    "intro": "Lethedon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it an otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent. Lethedon thrives in humid, shaded environments, often near water sources in dense forests. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a delicately balanced species within its ecosystem."
