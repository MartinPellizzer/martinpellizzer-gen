    "intro": "Lycopus lucidus f. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
