    "intro": "Loxanthocereus camanaensis, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. The cactus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert environments."
