    "intro": "Lupinus hypolasius, commonly known as the low lupine, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces spiny, cylindrical pods that contain several small, bean-like seeds. Lupinus hypolasius is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
