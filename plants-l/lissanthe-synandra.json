    "intro": "Lissanthe synandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf lissanthe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels, a characteristic feature of the Apiaceae family. Lissanthe synandra is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
