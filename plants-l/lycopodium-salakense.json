    "intro": "Lycopodium salakense, commonly known as the Salakense clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or upright stem with spirally arranged leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. Lycopodium salakense reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are characterized by the presence of strobila, which are the spore-bearing structures. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
