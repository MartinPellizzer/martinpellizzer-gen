    "intro": "Lycopodium alpinum subsp. kablikianum, commonly known as the Alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and mountainous habitats."
