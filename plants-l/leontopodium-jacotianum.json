    "intro": "Leontopodium jacotianum, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Pyrenees. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its hardiness in cold climates. Due to its striking appearance and cultural significance, it is also a symbol of purity and resilience."
