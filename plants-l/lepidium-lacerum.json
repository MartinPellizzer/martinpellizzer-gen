    "intro": "Lepidium lacerum, commonly known as the brokenhearted cress, is a small annual herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing stem with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
