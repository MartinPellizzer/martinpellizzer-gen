    "intro": "Leeuwenhoeckia tiliacea, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to erosion control and wildlife habitat."
