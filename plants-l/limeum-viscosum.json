    "intro": "Limeum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky lime tree, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its sticky, resinous sap, which gives it its common name and contributes to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a yellowish or greenish hue, and it produces fruit that is somewhat similar in appearance to a lime. Due to its unique properties, it has been studied for potential medicinal and industrial applications."
