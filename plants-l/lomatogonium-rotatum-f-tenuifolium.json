    "intro": "Lomatogonium rotatum f. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomatogonium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
