    "intro": "Lepidium lasiocarpum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, smooth-seeded pods that are typically covered in a fine, glandular coating. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the Lepidium genus."
