    "intro": "Linaria unilabiata, commonly known as the narrow-lipped toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces slender, tubular flowers with two lips, the lower lip being narrower than the upper one, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Linaria unilabiata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
