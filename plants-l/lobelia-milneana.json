    "intro": "Lobelia milneana, commonly known as the Kauai lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Lobelia milneana is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
