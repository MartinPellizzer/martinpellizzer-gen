It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, similar to other lettuces. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. This plant is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
