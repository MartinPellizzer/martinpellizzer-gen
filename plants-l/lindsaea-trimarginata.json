    "intro": "Lindsaea trimarginata, commonly known as the three-margin fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive three-lobed margin, which gives it its common name. Lindsaea trimarginata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
