    "intro": "Lycopodium weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Lycopodium weddellii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
