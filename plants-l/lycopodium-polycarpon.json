    "intro": "Lycopodium polycarpon, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem. Lycopodium polycarpon is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
