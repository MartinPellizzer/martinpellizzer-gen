    "intro": "Lippia schlimii, commonly known as Mexican mint or silverleaf mint, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its strong mint-like fragrance and is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Lippia schlimii is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience in various soil types."
