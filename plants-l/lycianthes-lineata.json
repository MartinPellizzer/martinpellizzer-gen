It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, and they are edible but often have a mild, tangy flavor. Lycianthes lineata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in various climates."
