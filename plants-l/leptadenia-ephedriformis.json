    "intro": "Leptadenia ephedriformis, commonly known as African ephedra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine. Its leaves and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used for their stimulant and antispasmodic effects. However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not widely cultivated."
