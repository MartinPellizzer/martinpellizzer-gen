    "intro": "Limonium liberianum, commonly known as the Liberian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of West Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to salty, well-drained environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Limonium liberianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal gardens."
