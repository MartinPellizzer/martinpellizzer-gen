    "intro": "Lindsaea cheiroides, commonly known as the hairy lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
