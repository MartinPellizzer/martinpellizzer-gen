    "intro": "Lithops marthae, commonly known as the \"Marr's ice plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, stone-like appearance, with two fleshy leaves that resemble rocks. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months. Lithops marthae is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
