It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and dense, rounded crown, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its arid native environment. Leucadendron totta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
