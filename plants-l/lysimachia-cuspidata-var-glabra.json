    "intro": "Lysimachia cuspidata var. glabra, commonly known as smooth willowherb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in smooth, glabrous skin, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly glossy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks."
