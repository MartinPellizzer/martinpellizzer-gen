    "intro": "Leymus villosissimus, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that becomes increasingly hairy with age. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
