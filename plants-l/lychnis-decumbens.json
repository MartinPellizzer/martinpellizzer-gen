    "intro": "Lychnis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bluet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lychnis decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
