    "intro": "Linum altaicum subsp. altaicum, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
