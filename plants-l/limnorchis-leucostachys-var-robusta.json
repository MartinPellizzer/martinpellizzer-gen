    "intro": "Limnorchis leucostachys var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The inflorescence consists of numerous small, elongated flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. This variety is distinguished by its robust growth and adaptability to moist, nutrient-rich soils."
