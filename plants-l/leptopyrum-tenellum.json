    "intro": "Leptopyrum tenellum, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows along the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Leptopyrum tenellum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
