    "intro": "Lactuca sativa var. yemensis, commonly known as Yemen lettuce, is a rare and lesser-known variety of lettuce native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, tightly packed leaves that are typically dark green in color. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with limited water resources. The plant grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm and produces a compact head similar to other lettuce varieties. It is valued for its crisp texture and mild, slightly sweet flavor, making it a unique addition to local cuisines."
