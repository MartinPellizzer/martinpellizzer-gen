    "intro": "Lappula sessilis, commonly known as the sessile lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant has a slender stem that branches near the base, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, usually ranging in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
