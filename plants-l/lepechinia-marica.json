    "intro": "Lepechinia marica, commonly known as sticky lepechinia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin, which helps protect it from herbivores and moisture loss. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Lepechinia marica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
