    "intro": "Lycopodium dacrydioides var. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying ancient plant lineages and ecological diversity."
