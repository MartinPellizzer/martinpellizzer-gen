    "intro": "Listia solitudinis, commonly known as the solitary lily, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the remote highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a single, elongated stem that rises above the surrounding vegetation. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded, mountainous regions. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring, producing a delicate fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Listia solitudinis is considered a vulnerable species."
