    "intro": "Lachnophyllum noeanum, commonly known as the white-flowered lichen, is a member of the Lachnophyllaceae family. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rocks and tree bark in temperate regions. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a dense, leathery thallus that is covered in a layer of hyphae. Lachnophyllum noeanum is often found in shaded, moist environments and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
