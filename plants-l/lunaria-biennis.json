It is characterized by its distinctive, lens-shaped seed pods that turn a striking purplish-blue as they mature. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and are also popular in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal."
