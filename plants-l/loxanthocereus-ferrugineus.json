    "intro": "Loxanthocereus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty night-blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and bear clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a woody base and produces small, yellow fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its nocturnal flowering habit, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming cycle."
