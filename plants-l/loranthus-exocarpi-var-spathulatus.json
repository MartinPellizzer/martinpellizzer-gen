    "intro": "Loranthus exocarpi var. spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause stress on its host trees if left unchecked."
