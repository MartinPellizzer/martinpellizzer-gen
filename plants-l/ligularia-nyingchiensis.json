    "intro": "Ligularia nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi ligularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
