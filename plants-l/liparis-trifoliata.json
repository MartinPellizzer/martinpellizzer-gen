    "intro": "Liparis trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The orchid is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in epiphytic or terrestrial habitats."
