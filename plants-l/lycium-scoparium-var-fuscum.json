    "intro": "Lycium scoparium var. fuscum, commonly known as the dark-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features spiny, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions. The berries are an important food source for birds and small mammals in its native habitat."
