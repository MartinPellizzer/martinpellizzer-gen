    "intro": "Lycianthes inaequilatera, commonly known as the unequal-armed physalis, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces distinctive inflated calyces that enclose its small, orange berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. The flowers are yellow with purple veins, and they bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value."
