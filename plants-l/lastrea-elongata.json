    "intro": "Lastrea elongata, commonly known as the longleaf lastrea, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a branching stem system with fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations include reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss and deep root systems to access underground moisture. Lastrea elongata is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
