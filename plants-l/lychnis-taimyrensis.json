It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Lychnis taimyrensis is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
