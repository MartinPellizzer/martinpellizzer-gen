    "intro": "Lasianthus floresensis, commonly known as the Flores strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Flores. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in forest understories and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. It features lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
