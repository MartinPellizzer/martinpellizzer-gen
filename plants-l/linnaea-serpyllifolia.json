    "intro": "Linnaea serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. Linnaea serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing ground cover."
