    "intro": "Ligularia clivorum, commonly known as the alpine ligularia, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
