    "intro": "Laurus smilacifolia, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant, wintergreen-like scent when peeled. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin with a slightly hairy underside. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils."
