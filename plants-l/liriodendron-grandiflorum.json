    "intro": "Liriodendron grandiflorum, commonly known as the tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-green flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical fruit clusters that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The tulip tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability."
