    "intro": "Lewisia finchae, commonly known as the Finch's lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of Oregon and northern California. It belongs to the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
