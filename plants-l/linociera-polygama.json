    "intro": "Linociera polygama, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bignon, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Linociera polygama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
