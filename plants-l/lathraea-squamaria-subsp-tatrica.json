    "intro": "Lathraea squamaria subsp. tatrica, commonly known as the Tatran lichen orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that grows in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its unique, leafless stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is typically found on rocky slopes and in mountainous areas with acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
