    "intro": "Linum cribrosum, commonly known as the hairy flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Linum cribrosum is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been historically used for textile production, similar to other flax species."
