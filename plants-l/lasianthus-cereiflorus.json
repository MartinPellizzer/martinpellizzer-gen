    "intro": "Lasianthus cereiflorus, commonly known as the waxflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, waxy flowers that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, adding to its visual appeal."
