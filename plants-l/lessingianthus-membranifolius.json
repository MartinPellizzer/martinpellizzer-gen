    "intro": "Lessingianthus membranifolius, commonly known as the membranous-leaved sunflower, is a striking annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and narrow, papery leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Lessingianthus membranifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its bright, sun-like appearance."
