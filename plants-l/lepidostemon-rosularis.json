It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
