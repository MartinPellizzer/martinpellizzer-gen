    "intro": "Lepidium heterophyllum var. pratense, commonly known as field peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces numerous small, yellowish flowers in clusters. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
