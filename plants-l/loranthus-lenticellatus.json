    "intro": "Loranthus lenticellatus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are usually small, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms a symbiotic relationship with various tree species."
