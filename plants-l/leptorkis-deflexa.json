    "intro": "Leptorkis deflexa, commonly known as the flexible leptorkis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silky texture. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped heads, typical of the carrot family. Leptorkis deflexa is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
