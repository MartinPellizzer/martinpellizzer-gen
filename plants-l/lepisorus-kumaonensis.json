    "intro": "Lepisorus kumaonensis, commonly known as the Kumaon shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. Native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and stout, with dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
