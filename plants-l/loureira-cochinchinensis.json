    "intro": "Loureira cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
