    "intro": "Leucaena glabrata, commonly known as the silverleaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is a fast-growing species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
