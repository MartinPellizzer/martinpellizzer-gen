It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant features intricate, delicate fronds with a unique, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf axils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
