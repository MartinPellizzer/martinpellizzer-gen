    "intro": "Linaria alpina subsp. guarensis, commonly known as the Alpine toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, adapting to harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
