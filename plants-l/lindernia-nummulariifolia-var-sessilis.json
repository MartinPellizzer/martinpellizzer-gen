    "intro": "Lindernia nummulariifolia var. sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, round to oval-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pale purple to pink in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
