    "intro": "Lathraea squamaria, commonly known as the squamaria lichen or the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is a hemiparasitic species that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is often found in shaded, moist environments. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing on the roots of trees and shrubs. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
