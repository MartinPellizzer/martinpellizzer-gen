    "intro": "Letestuella chevalieri, commonly known as the chevalier's letestuella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, adapted to the harsh coastal environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Letestuella chevalieri is considered a vulnerable species."
