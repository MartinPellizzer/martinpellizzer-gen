    "intro": "Limosella aquatica f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial marsh plant, is a low-growing, herbaceous species native to wetland environments. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often waterlogged habitat. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
