    "intro": "Lupinus arizonicus subsp. lagunensis, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, playing a role in nitrogen fixation and supporting local wildlife."
