    "intro": "Lamium armenum, commonly known as Armenian speedwell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in pairs, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Lamium armenum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
