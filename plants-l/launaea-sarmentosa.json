    "intro": "Launaea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping daisy, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Launaea sarmentosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments."
