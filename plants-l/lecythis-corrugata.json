It is characterized by its large, thick, and corrugated leaves, which give it its common name. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and seeds have been utilized for their medicinal properties, including antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
