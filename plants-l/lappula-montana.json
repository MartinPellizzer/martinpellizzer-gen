It belongs to the family Camelineae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain several seeds. Lappula montana is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
