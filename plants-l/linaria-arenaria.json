    "intro": "Linaria arenaria, commonly known as sand toadflax, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are tubular in shape, with two lips that are characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Linaria arenaria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and coastal cliffs."
