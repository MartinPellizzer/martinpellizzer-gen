    "intro": "Limniris henryi, commonly known as Henry's limniris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Limniris henryi is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
