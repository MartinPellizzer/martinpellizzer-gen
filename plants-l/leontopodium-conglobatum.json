    "intro": "Leontopodium conglobatum, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround the small yellow flowers, giving it a distinctive and fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are basal, fleshy, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and association with alpine beauty, it is a symbol of resilience and is protected in many regions."
