    "intro": "Lycium hassei, commonly known as the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and neighboring regions. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their mild toxicity. Lycium hassei thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
