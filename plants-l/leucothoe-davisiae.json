    "intro": "Leucothoe davisiae, commonly known as Davis's leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and seasonal berries, which attract wildlife."
