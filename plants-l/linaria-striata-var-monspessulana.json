    "intro": "Linaria striata var. monspessulana, commonly known as the Portuguese toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal areas and limestone soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, delicate blooms."
