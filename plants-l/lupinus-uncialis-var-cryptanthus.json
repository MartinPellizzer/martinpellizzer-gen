    "intro": "Lupinus uncialis var. cryptanthus, commonly known as the cryptanthus lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
