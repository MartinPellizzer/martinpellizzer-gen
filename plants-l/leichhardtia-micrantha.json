It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Leichhardtia micrantha is often found in open woodlands and shrublands, where it contributes to the local floral diversity."
