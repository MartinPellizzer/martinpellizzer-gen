    "intro": "Linnaea sulcata, commonly known as the grooved twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive grooved texture on the underside, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two. Linnaea sulcata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
