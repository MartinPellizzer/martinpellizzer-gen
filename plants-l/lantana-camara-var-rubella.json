    "intro": "Lantana camara var. rubella, commonly known as the red lantana, is a flowering shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically red, orange, or yellow. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators. However, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
