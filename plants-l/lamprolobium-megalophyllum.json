It is characterized by its large, showy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
