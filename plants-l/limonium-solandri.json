    "intro": "Limonium solandri, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant is often found growing in dunes, coastal grasslands, and rocky shores, where it tolerates high salinity and poor soil conditions. Limonium solandri is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought-resistant and hardy nature. Its flowers bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to coastal landscapes."
