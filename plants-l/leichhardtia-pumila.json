    "intro": "Leichhardtia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf leichhardtia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the eastern coast of Australia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
