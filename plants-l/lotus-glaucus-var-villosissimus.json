    "intro": "Lotus glaucus var. villosissimus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
