    "intro": "Lithocardium amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting native pollinators such as birds and insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Lithocardium amplifolium is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, demonstrating its adaptability to extreme environments."
