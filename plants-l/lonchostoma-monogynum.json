    "intro": "Lonchostoma monogynum, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower per stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve water, and it produces a distinct, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
