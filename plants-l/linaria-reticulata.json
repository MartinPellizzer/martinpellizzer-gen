    "intro": "Linaria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined toadflax, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange flowers in the shape of a slender tube, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Linaria reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
