    "intro": "Laserpitium garganicum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces, which set it apart from other variants of the species."
