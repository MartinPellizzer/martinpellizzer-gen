    "intro": "Lupinus hesperius, commonly known as the coastal lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus hesperius is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun, and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
