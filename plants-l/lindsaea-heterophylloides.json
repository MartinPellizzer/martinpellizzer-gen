    "intro": "Lindsaea heterophylloides, commonly known as the variable feather-fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
