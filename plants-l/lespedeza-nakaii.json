    "intro": "Lespedeza nakaii, commonly known as Japanese lespedeza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Lespedeza nakaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
