    "intro": "Lomaria glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular lomaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its stems are often hairy and bear glandular structures, which may play a role in defense against herbivores. Lomaria glandulifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
