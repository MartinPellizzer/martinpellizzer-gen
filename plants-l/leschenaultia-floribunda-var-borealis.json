    "intro": "Leschenaultia floribunda var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in polar ecosystems."
