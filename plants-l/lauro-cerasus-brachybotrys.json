    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus brachybotrys, commonly known as the Japanese cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its leaves and fruits."
