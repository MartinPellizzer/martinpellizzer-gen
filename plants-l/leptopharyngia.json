    "intro": "Leptopharyngia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Leptopharyngia species are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting to harsh maritime environments. Their flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and they play a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Leptopharyngia congesta being one of the most well-known."
