    "intro": "Lotodes zeyheri, commonly known as the water crown, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features long, slender leaves that float on the water surface, with the leaves being narrow and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Lotodes zeyheri is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds."
