    "intro": "Lupinus brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Lupinus brittonii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
