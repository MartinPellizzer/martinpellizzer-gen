    "intro": "Lotus pedunculatus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. Its root system consists of rhizomes that anchor it in muddy substrates, while its stems are flexible and adapted to aquatic environments. This variety is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands."
