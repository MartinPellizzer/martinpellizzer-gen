    "intro": "Loxocalyx ambiguus var. laciniatus, commonly known as the lace-leaf holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The varietal form *laciniatus* distinguishes it from other varieties through its more pronounced leaf lobing and intricate foliage structure."
