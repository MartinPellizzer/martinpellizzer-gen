    "intro": "Lemna cruciata, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It has tiny, broad leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, often with a distinct cross-shaped pattern on the underside. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the nodes along the stem. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
