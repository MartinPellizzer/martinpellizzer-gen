    "intro": "Lespedeza canescens, commonly known as frostweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-white pubescent stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Lespedeza canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
