    "intro": "Loranthus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalypts and acacias. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, affecting its growth and health."
