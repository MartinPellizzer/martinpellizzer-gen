It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that is typically dark green. The plant produces cones that are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous terrain."
