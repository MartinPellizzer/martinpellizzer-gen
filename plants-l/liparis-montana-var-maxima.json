    "intro": "Liparis montana var. maxima, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help anchor it to its rocky substrate. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
