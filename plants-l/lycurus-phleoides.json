    "intro": "Lycurus phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lycurus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its roots are known for their medicinal properties, used traditionally in local remedies for skin conditions and inflammation. Due to habitat loss, Lycurus phleoides is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
