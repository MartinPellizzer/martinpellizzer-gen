It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay, where it thrives in humid tropical forests. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
