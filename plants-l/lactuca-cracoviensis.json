    "intro": "Lactuca cracoviensis, commonly known as the Cracow lettuce, is a species of wild lettuce native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a herbaceous plant with alternate, hairy, and usually lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its milky sap, like other lactuca species, contains lactucine, a bitter compound. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and anti-inflammatory properties."
