It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
