    "intro": "Lepanthes georgii, commonly known as the George's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes georgii is often found in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests."
