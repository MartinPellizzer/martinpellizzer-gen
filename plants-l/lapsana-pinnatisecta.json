    "intro": "Lapsana pinnatisecta, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Lapsana pinnatisecta is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
