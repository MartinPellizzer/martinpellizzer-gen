It is characterized by its spreading growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
