    "intro": "Lachemilla resupinata, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover."
