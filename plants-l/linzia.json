    "intro": "Linzia, commonly known as the common linseed plant, is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the family Pedaliaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, flat seeds. Linzia is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of linseed oil."
