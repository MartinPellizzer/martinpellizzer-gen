    "intro": "Luisia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, velvety thallus covered with small, wart-like structures called pseudopores. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
