    "intro": "Leptormus, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Leptormus species usually have slender stems and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their leaves are often narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and they produce small, clustered flowers in various colors. The genus is notable for its ornamental value and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal."
