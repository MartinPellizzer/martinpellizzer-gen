    "intro": "Lamium leucolophum, commonly known as white-lip deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green stripe along the midrib, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Lamium leucolophum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
