    "intro": "Leptonychia dewildei, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptonychia dewildei is considered a vulnerable species."
