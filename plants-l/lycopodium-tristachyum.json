    "intro": "Lycopodium tristachyum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that grows from a rhizome, producing upright, branching stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are released into the air for reproduction. Lycopodium tristachyum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early terrestrial plants."
