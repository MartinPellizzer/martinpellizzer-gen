    "intro": "Lasiorrhiza neaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important species such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
