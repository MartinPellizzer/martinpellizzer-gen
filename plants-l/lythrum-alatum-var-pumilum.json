    "intro": "Lythrum alatum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf purple loosestrife, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous pink to purple flowers, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture. While it is ornamental in gardens, it can become invasive in natural habitats if not carefully managed."
