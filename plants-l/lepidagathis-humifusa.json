    "intro": "Lepidagathis humifusa, commonly known as the dwarf lepidagathis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically forms a dense mat of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils effectively. Lepidagathis humifusa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
