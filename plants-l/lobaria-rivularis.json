    "intro": "Lobaria rivularis, commonly known as the river lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct lobes and a granular texture. The lichen contains a unique combination of photobionts, primarily green algae, and a fungal component from the genus Lobaria. It is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health."
