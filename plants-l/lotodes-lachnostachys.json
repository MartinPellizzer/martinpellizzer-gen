It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Lotodes lachnostachys plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
