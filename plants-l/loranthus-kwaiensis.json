    "intro": "Loranthus kwaiensis, commonly known as the Kwa\u00efns loranthus, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It attaches itself to the stems of its host plants, typically trees in the family Euphorbiaceae, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant derives some of its nutrients and water from the host, while also performing photosynthesis using its leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Loranthus kwaiensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
