    "intro": "Lindsaea hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
