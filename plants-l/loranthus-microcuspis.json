    "intro": "Loranthus microcuspis, commonly known as the small-cusped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species plays an important ecological role in its native range by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various animals."
