    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. aurantiopurpurea, commonly known as the red-purple twinflower, is a rare and striking variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite pairs of small, bell-shaped flowers that display a unique combination of orange and purple hues. This evergreen shrub is native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Asia, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. The plant's ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and specialized horticulture."
