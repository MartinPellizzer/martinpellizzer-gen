    "intro": "Lathyrus gorgoni subsp. lineatus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. Its pods are slender and contain several elliptical seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
