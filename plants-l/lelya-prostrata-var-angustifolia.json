    "intro": "Lelya prostrata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lelya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
