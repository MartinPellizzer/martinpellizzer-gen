    "intro": "Lindsaea societatis, commonly known as the society fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into numerous small, linear segments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Lindsaea societatis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
