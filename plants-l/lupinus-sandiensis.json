    "intro": "Lupinus sandiensis, commonly known as the sand larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lupinus sandiensis is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and rocky outcrops."
