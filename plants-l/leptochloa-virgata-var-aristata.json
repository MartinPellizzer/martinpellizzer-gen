It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
