    "intro": "Lindsaea lucida subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
