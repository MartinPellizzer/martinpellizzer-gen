    "intro": "Leptobalanus albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflowered beech, is a rare and endangered species native to a limited geographic region in Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a glossy upper surface with a hairy underside. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
