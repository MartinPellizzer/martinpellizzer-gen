    "intro": "Lotus callis-viridis, commonly known as the desert lotus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its growth habit is typically prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground in sandy or rocky soils. Lotus callis-viridis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
