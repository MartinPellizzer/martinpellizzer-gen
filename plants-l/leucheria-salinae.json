    "intro": "Leucheria salinae, commonly known as the salt marsh lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in saline environments. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces or soil. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and contributing to nutrient cycling in salt marsh ecosystems. This lichen is often found in coastal regions where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating moisture levels."
