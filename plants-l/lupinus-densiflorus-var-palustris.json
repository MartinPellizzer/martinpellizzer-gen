    "intro": "Lupinus densiflorus var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Lupinus densiflorus var. palustris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
