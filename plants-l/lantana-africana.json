    "intro": "Lantana africana, commonly known as the African lantana, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
