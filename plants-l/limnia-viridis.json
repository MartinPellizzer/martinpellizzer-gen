    "intro": "Limnia viridis, commonly known as the green water flea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the order Cladocera. It is characterized by its transparent exoskeleton and a distinctive greenish tint due to the presence of chloroplasts in its cells. This plant-like feature allows it to perform photosynthesis, making it a primary producer in freshwater ecosystems. Limnia viridis thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight. It plays a crucial role in the food web by serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
