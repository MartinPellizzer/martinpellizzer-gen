It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its unique, glass-like petals that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with a distinctive calyx that resembles a small shield. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
