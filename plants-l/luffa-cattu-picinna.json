    "intro": "Luffa cattu-picinna, commonly known as the sponge gourd or loofah, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its fibrous, spongy interior that develops after the fruit matures and dries. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow,\u74e0-shaped fruits that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The fibrous structure of the fruit is harvested when fully mature and dried, making it useful for exfoliating baths and natural cleaning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
