    "intro": "Linum brevifolium f. majus, commonly known as the giant flax, is a cultivated variant of the flax species characterized by its larger size and more showy flowers. It is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, though it is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct floral structure and its historical association with the cultivation of flax fibers."
