    "intro": "Ludisia dawsoniana, commonly known as the Dawson's lace fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Ludisia dawsoniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to forest biodiversity and supporting pollinator populations."
