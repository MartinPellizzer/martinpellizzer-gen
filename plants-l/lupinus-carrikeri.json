    "intro": "Lupinus carrikeri, commonly known as the Carriker's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Lupinus carrikeri is part of the legume family, which means it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
