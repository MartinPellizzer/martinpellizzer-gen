    "intro": "Lonicera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are red berries that mature in late summer and are an important food source for birds. Lonicera uniflora is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
