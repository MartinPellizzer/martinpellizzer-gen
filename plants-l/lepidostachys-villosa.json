It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are often broad and have a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Lepidostachys villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates."
