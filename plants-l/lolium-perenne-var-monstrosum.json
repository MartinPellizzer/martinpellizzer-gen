It exhibits enhanced tillering and longer, more vigorous leaves compared to standard ryegrass varieties. This plant is often cultivated for its high forage value and rapid establishment in agricultural settings. Botanically, it possesses a fibrous root system and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable species in both pasture and turfgrass management."
