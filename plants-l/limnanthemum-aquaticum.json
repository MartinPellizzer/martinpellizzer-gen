    "intro": "Limnanthemum aquaticum, commonly known as the water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, usually from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it. Limnanthemum aquaticum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous wildlife."
