    "intro": "Limnophila chinensis, commonly known as the water willow, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Limnophila chinensis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
