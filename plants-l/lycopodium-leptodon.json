    "intro": "Lycopodium leptodon, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along its stems, giving it a dense appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories across temperate regions. Lycopodium leptodon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
