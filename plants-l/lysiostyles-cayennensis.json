    "intro": "Lysiostyles cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne lysiostyle, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
