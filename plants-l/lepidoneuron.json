    "intro": "Lepidoneuron, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique plant species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-green fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. The plant is an evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are composed of multiple segments, with the central leaflet being the most prominent. Lepidoneuron plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
