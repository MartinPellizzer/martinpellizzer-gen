    "intro": "Latania plagicoma, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Latania plagicoma plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small wildlife."
