    "intro": "Lavandula pedunculata var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
