    "intro": "Leptorkis, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers and their preference for moist, shaded environments. Leptorkis species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered blooms in various colors. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Leptorkis are considered rare or endangered."
