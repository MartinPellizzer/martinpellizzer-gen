    "intro": "Lomatium cous, commonly known as Indian spinach, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter, spinach-like flavor, making it a traditional foraging plant. Lomatium cous is also valued for its medicinal properties, used by indigenous peoples for its purported health benefits."
