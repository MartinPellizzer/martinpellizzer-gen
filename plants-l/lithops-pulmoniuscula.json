    "intro": "Lithops pulmoniuscula, commonly known as the \"Pulmoniuscula Lithops,\" is a species of succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance, with two fleshy, paired leaves that resemble small stones. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, which are covered in a fine layer of white powder to reduce water loss. It blooms with small, yellowish flowers during the winter months, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in arid environments."
