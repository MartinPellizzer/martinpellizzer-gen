It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental plant."
