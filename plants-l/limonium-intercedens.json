    "intro": "Limonium intercedens, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Limonium intercedens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
