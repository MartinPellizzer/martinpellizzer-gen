    "intro": "Lannea triphylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with three leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, orange-red fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction, though overharvesting has led to conservation concerns."
