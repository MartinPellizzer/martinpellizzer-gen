    "intro": "Lyrochilus hilarianus, commonly known as the Hilarian's lyreleaf, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique lyre-shaped leaves, which are broad and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
