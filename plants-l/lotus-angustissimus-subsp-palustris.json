    "intro": "Lotus angustissimus subsp. palustris, commonly known as the narrowleaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and improve water quality. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in ponds and water gardens."
