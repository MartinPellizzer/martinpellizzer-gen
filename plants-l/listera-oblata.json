    "intro": "Listera oblata, commonly known as the white toothwort, is a small herbaceous perennial native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short stem with a single, erect flower stalk, and its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Listera oblata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
