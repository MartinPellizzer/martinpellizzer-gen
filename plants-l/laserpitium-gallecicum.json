It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and grasslands. It is a perennial herb with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
