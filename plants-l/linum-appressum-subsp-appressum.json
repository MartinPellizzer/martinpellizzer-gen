    "intro": "Linum appressum subsp. appressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for fiber production, similar to other flax species."
