    "intro": "Lepisorus hsiawutaiensis, commonly known as the Hsiawutai fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
