    "intro": "Licuala acutifida var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Licuala, is a species of cycad native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that are typically borne on separate male and female plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
