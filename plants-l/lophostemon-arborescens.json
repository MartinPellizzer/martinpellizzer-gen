    "intro": "Lophostemon arborescens, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in urban and natural landscapes."
