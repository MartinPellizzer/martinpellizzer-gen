    "intro": "Lycopodium cunninghamioides, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features whorled leaves and produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores. Lycopodium cunninghamioides is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense mats. This ancient plant is an important component of the undergrowth in temperate and subtropical ecosystems."
