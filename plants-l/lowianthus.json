    "intro": "Lowianthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lowianthus typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with sturdy stems and showy blooms in shades of pink, purple, and white. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
