    "intro": "Lupinus austrorientalis, commonly known as the eastern lupine, is a flowering plant native to parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnate leaves. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Lupinus austrorientalis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plants."
