    "intro": "Lupinus disjunctus, commonly known as the Disjunct Lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spiny pods. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of purple or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
