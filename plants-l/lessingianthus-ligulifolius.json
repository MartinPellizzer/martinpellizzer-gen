It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, tubular florets arranged in a composite head, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
