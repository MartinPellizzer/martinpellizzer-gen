    "intro": "Lindsaea klotzschiana, commonly known as the Klotzsch's spikemoss, is a member of the family Lindsaeaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive structure with a creeping stem and dense clusters of leaves that form rosettes. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in spikes. Lindsaea klotzschiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
