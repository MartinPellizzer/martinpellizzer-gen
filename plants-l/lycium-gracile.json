    "intro": "Lycium gracile, commonly known as the slender boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, spiny stems and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains seeds and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Lycium gracile is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive with minimal water."
