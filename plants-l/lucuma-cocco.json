    "intro": "Lucuma cocco, commonly known as the golden apple of the Andes, is a South American plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is closely related to the avocado. The fruit of Lucuma cocco is typically harvested when it reaches maturity, which is indicated by its change in color from green to a golden-yellow hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of its unique, spiky fruit. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
