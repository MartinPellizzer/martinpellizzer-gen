    "intro": "Luzula japonica, commonly known as Japanese woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to greenish flowers. Native to East Asia, particularly Japan and parts of Korea, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant has fibrous roots and produces rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Its foliage is often used in traditional landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
