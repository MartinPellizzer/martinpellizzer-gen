It features showy, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia ciliata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
