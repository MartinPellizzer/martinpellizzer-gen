    "intro": "Loasa decorticans, commonly known as the brittle leaf loasa, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Loasa decorticans is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats."
