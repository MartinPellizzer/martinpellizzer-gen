    "intro": "Loxogramme mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Central America. It has delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes, resembling the leaves of water clover species. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Loxogramme mexicana is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
