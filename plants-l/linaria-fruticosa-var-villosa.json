It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
