    "intro": "Lyonia calyculata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf lyonia, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in woodland settings."
