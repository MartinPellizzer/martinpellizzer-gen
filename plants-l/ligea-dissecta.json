It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Ligea dissecta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
