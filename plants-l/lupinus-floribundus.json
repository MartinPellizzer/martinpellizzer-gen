    "intro": "Lupinus floribundus, commonly known as the showy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Lupinus floribundus is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a nectar source for pollinators."
