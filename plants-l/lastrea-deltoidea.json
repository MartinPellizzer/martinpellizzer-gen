    "intro": "Lastrea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf lastrea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by pale green, triangular fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
