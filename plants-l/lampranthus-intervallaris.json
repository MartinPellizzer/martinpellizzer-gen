It features dense clusters of vibrant red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. The species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
