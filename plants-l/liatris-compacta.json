    "intro": "Liatris compacta, commonly known as compact blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, spiky flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and produces pink to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Liatris compacta is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
