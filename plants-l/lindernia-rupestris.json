    "intro": "Lindernia rupestris, commonly known as the rock lindernia, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, hairy leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along its slender stems. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid environments. Lindernia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
