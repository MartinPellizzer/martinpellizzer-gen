    "intro": "Lycopodioides guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by wind, a common trait among primitive vascular plants. Lycopodioides guatemalensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
