    "intro": "Lotus crassifolius var. subglaber, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of the water body while its stems support the foliage. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping to reduce water loss and provide buoyancy."
