    "intro": "Lindsaea pallens, commonly known as the pale lindsaea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Lindsaea pallens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
