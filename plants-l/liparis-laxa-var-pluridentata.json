    "intro": "Liparis laxa var. pluridentata, commonly known as the many-toothed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in eastern North America. It features a slender, upright stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often hairy. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, toothed petals and sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the wet, organic-rich soil in which it grows. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in bogs and along the edges of marshes."
