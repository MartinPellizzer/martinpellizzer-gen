    "intro": "Linaria viscida, commonly known as sticky toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry grasslands. Linaria viscida is a member of the Plantaginaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
