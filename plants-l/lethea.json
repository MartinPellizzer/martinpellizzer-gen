    "intro": "Lethea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces delicate, pale blue flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Lethea thrives in cool, humid environments and requires shaded, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticultural enthusiasts."
