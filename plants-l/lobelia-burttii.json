    "intro": "Lobelia burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in montane forests or grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces distinctive seed capsules that disperse its seeds through wind. Lobelia burttii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
