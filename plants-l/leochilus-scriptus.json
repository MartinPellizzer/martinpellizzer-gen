    "intro": "Leochilus scriptus, commonly known as the script lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like thallus that is typically grayish-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Leochilus scriptus is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
