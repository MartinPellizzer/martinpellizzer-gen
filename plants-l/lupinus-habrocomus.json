    "intro": "Lupinus habrocomus, commonly known as the silky lupin, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of soft, fluffy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules that benefit soil fertility. Lupinus habrocomus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance to local pollinators."
