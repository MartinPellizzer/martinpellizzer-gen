    "intro": "Lophira lanceolata, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The bark is thick, rough, and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance."
