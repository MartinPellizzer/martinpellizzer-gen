It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom from mid-summer to early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and covered in fine hairs. It grows up to 2 to 4 feet tall and prefers moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
