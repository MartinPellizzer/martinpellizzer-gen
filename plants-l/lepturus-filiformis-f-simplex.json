    "intro": "Lepturus filiformis f. simplex, commonly known as the simple filiform lichen, is a rare and delicate lichen species characterized by its slender, thread-like thallus. It typically grows on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree trunks or rocks in cool, humid environments. The plant exhibits a simple morphology with a lack of distinct lobes or branches, which is a defining feature of the f. simplex form. It is often found in temperate regions where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific algae or cyanobacteria. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
