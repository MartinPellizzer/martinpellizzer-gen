    "intro": "Lagenandra toxicaria var. toxicaria, commonly known as the toxic arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. It contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact with skin or ingestion. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful handling."
