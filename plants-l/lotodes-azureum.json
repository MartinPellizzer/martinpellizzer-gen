    "intro": "Lotodes azureum, commonly known as the blue water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the substrate. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
