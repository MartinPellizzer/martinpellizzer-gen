    "intro": "Larix decidua subsp. sudetica, commonly known as the Carpathian larch, is a subspecies of the European larch native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needle-like leaves in the autumn, which is a rare trait among conifers. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh alpine conditions."
