    "intro": "Larrea simulans, commonly known as screwwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Larrea simulans is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
