It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
