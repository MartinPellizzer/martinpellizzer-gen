    "intro": "Lycopodium lindenii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant features a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Lycopodium lindenii thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
