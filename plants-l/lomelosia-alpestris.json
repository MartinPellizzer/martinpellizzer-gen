    "intro": "Lomelosia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lomelosia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
