    "intro": "Ladenbergia ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and long, narrow leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
