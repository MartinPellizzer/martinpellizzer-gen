    "intro": "Lycopus virginicus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as large-leaf water-hemlock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
