    "intro": "Lindsaea gomphophylla, commonly known as the Gomphophylla lace fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Lindsaea gomphophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
