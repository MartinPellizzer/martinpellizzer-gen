    "intro": "Limonium normannicum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its hardy and resilient nature. Limonium normannicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal environments."
