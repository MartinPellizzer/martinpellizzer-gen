    "intro": "Lepidospartum striatum, commonly known as Spanish heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in Mediterranean-style gardens."
