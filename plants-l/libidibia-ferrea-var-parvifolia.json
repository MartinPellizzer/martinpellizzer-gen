    "intro": "Libidibia ferrea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing flattened seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
