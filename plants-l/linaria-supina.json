It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that produces bright yellow or orange flowers resembling those of the common toadflax. The plant has slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Linaria supina thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
