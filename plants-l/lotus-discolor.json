It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often spotted with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its stems float on the water's surface. Lotus discolor is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
