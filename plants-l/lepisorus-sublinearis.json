    "intro": "Lepisorus sublinearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
