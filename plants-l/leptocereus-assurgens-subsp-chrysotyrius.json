    "intro": "Leptocereus assurgens subsp. chrysotyrius, commonly known as the golden-hair cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, yellowish spines that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
