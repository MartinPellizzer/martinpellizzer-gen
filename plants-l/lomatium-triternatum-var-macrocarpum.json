    "intro": "Lomatium triternatum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seeds with a tuft of silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
