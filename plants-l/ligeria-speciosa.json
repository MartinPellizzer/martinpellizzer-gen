    "intro": "Ligeria speciosa, commonly known as the showy ligeria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Ligeria speciosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
