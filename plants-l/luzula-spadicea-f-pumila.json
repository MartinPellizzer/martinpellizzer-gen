    "intro": "Luzula spadicea f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bog sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It features slender, grass-like stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters tall, with small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental quality to its habitat. It is well adapted to poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist areas of northern temperate regions."
