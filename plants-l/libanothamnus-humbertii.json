    "intro": "Libanothamnus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Libanothamnus humbertii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
