    "intro": "Linum sulphureum var. sulphureopurpureum, commonly known as the sulphur purple flax, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which transition to a deep purple hue as they mature. The plant produces slender, fibrous stems that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration and ecological benefits."
