    "intro": "Lycopodium tauri, commonly known as the Taurian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in cones at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium tauri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with acidic soils. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
