    "intro": "Lotus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern and eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. The lotus is also valued for its ability to thrive in muddy waters while maintaining clean, unblemished flowers."
