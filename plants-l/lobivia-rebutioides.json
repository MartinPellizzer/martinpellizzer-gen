    "intro": "Lobivia rebutioides, commonly known as the Rebutia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a compact, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Lobivia rebutioides is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
