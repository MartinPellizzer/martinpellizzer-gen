    "intro": "Lepanthes palaga, commonly known as the Palaga orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically small to medium in size. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that often appear during the rainy season. Lepanthes palaga grows in shaded, humid environments, typically in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
