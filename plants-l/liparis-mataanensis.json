    "intro": "Liparis mataanensis, commonly known as the Mataan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to habitat loss, Liparis mataanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
