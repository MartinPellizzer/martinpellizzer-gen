It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Smooth ryegrass is an important forage plant but can become invasive in certain environments."
