It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a waxy texture, and its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
