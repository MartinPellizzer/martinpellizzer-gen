    "intro": "Lingnania papillata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like organs covered in fine, hair-like structures called papillae. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying aquatic ecosystems and carnivorous plant adaptations."
