    "intro": "Lobivia horrida, commonly known as the horrid lobivia, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Lobivia horrida is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
