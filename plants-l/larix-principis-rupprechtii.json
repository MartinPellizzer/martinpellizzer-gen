    "intro": "Larix principis-rupprechtii, commonly known as the Chinese larch, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically a dark green on top and whitish underneath, and its distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open or disturbed areas. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found at high altitudes. The bark of the Chinese larch is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions."
