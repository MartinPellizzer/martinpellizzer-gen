    "intro": "Levisticum aquilegiifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves that resemble those of parsley, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
