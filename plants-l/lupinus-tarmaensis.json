    "intro": "Lupinus tarmaensis, commonly known as the Tarma lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers, typically in shades of purple or blue, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus tarmaensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its native habitat."
