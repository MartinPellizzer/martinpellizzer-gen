    "intro": "Lamium cavernianum, commonly known as the cave lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the limestone regions of Europe. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas and rocky crevices. Lamium cavernianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult soil conditions."
