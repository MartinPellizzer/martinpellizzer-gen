    "intro": "Lonicera caerulea subsp. pallasii, commonly known as the Sakhalin honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, bright red berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forest edges and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in traditional cuisine and herbal remedies."
