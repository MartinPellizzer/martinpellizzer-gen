    "intro": "Lycopodium quadriforiatum, commonly known as the four-leaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features whorled leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are typically found at the tips of its stems. Lycopodium quadriforiatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
