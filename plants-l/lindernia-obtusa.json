    "intro": "Lindernia obtusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf lindernia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Lindernia obtusa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and extended blooming period."
