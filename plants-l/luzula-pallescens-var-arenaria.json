    "intro": "Luzula pallescens var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand rush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, coastal environments. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are pollinated by wind. Luzula pallescens var. arenaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
