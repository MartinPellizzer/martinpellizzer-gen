    "intro": "Linkia pinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Linkia pinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
