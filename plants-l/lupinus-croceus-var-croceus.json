    "intro": "Lupinus croceus var. croceus, commonly known as the yellow lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and palmately divided leaves, which are typical of the Lupinus genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its seed pods contain several small, elliptical seeds that are used as forage for livestock. The yellow lupine plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
