    "intro": "Liparis ficicola, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and often form a rosette at the base, aiding in moisture retention. Liparis ficicola is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes."
