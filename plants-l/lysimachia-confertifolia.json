    "intro": "Lysimachia confertifolia, commonly known as the denseflower chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia confertifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
