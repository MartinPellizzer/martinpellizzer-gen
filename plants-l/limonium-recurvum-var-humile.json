    "intro": "Limonium recurvum var. humile, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically blue-green in color, and the flowers bloom in summer. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
