    "intro": "Lecokia, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to South America. These plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Lecokia species are often found in moist, acidic soils and thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
