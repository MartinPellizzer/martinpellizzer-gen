    "intro": "Lonicera codonantha, commonly known as the creeping honeysuckle, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can spread along the ground or climb structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Lonicera codonantha is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth."
