    "intro": "Lathyrus affinis, commonly known as the common vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports or other vegetation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. Lathyrus affinis is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and agricultural settings."
