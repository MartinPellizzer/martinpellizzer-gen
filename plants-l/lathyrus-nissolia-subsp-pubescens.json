It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and stems, which provide a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
