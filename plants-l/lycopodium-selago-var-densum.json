    "intro": "Lycopodium selago var. densum, commonly known as the dense clubmoss, is a variant of the clubmoss species Lycopodium selago. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features densely packed, scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. This variety is characterized by its dense foliage and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
