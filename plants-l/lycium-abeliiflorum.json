    "intro": "Lycium abeliiflorum, commonly known as the Abeliiflorum boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Lycium abeliiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
