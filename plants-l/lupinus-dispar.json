    "intro": "Lupinus dispar, commonly known as the slender lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus dispar is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
