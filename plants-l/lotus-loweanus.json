    "intro": "Lotus loweanus, commonly known as the dwarf lotus, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters and has heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the sediment in the water. Lotus loweanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
