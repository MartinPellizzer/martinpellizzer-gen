    "intro": "Lycopodium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that enclose the sporangia, which release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. Lycopodium longipes is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Paleozoic era."
