    "intro": "Lobelia gaudichaudii var. kauaensis, commonly known as Kauaean lobelia, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside habitats. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
