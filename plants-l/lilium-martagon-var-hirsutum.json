It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, arranged in a loose, cup-like inflorescence. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its \"hirsutum\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The blooms appear in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to the landscape."
