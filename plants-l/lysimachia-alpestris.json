    "intro": "Lysimachia alpestris, commonly known as alpine chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, adapted to thrive in cold, rocky environments. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and moist, shaded woodlands, where it forms dense mats. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Lysimachia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
