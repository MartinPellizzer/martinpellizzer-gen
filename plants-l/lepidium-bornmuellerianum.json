    "intro": "Lepidium bornmuellerianum, commonly known as the Bornean cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, green, lobed leaves and clusters of tiny white or yellow flowers. It produces small, round, seed-like fruits called siliques, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. Lepidium bornmuellerianum is often found in forest understories and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
