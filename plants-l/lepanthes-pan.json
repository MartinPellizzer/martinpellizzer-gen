    "intro": "Lepanthes pan, commonly known as the Panan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. The orchid's flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
