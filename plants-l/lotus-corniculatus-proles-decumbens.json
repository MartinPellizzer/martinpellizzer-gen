    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus proles decumbens, commonly known as the creeping yellow bird's-foot trefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive trifoliate leaf structure, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
