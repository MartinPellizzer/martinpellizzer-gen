It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Leptosiphon aureus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
