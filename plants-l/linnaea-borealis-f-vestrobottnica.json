    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. vestrobottnica, commonly known as the \"Little Wintergreen,\" is a rare and distinctive variant of the twinflower plant. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, waxy leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the boreal forests of northern Europe and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Its foliage remains green throughout the winter, giving it its common name. This form is particularly notable for its unique coloration and ecological significance in its habitat."
