    "intro": "Loranthus calyculatus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds through its own photosynthetic processes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered at the base of its stem. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus calyculatus is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, and is often used in traditional medicine."
