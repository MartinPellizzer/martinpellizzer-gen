    "intro": "Lyonia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf lyonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a smooth, slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental use."
