    "intro": "Lespedeza striata var. stipulacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive stipular structure, which is a characteristic feature of the species. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
