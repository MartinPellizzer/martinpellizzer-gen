    "intro": "Lannea ornifolia, commonly known as the African velvetwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Lannea ornifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
