    "intro": "Lagerstroemia elegans, commonly known as the crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, long-lasting bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that appear in summer, followed by distinctive, papery fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically oval with a smooth margin. Lagerstroemia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types and climates."
