    "intro": "Larix \u00d7 eurokurilensis, commonly known as the European larch, is a hybrid coniferous tree resulting from the cross between the European larch (Larix decidua) and the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi). It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically bright green and turn gold in autumn before shedding, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual appeal."
