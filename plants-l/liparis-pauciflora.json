    "intro": "Liparis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Liparis pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
