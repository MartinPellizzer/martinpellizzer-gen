    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana, commonly known as the golden lion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing succulent that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
