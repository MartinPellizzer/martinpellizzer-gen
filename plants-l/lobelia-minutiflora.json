    "intro": "Lobelia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lobelia, is a delicate annual herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
