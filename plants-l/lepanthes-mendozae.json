    "intro": "Lepanthes mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air, and it blooms during the wet season. Lepanthes mendozae is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
