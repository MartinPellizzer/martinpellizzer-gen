    "intro": "Lycopodioides cupressina, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and scale-like leaves that give it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Lycopodioides cupressina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
