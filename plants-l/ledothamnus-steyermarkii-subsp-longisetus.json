    "intro": "Ledothamnus steyermarkii subsp. longisetus, commonly known as the longisetous ledothamnus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer, more robust setae (bristle-like structures) on the stems compared to other subspecies of Ledothamnus."
