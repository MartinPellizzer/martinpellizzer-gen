    "intro": "Loranthus rhaphidophorus, commonly known as the red or yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
