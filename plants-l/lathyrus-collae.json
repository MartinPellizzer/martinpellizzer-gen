    "intro": "Lathyrus collae, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and its compound leaves are characterized by their trifoliate structure. Lathyrus collae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
