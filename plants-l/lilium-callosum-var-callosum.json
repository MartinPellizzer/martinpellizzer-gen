It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive callus-like structure on the inner petals. The plant produces bulbous roots and has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette.

Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and unique floral morphology."
