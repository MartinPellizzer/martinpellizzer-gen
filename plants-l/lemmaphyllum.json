    "intro": "Lemmaphyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a leathery texture. Flowers are usually tubular or spurred and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. Lemmaphyllum species are native to regions of South America and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
