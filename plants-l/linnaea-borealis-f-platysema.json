    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. platysema, commonly known as the broad-leaved twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Europe. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with opposite, elliptical leaves that are broader than the typical form. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in pairs, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. This form is distinguished by its broader leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
