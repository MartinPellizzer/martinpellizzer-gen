The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ornamental value is highly appreciated in horticulture due to its vibrant seasonal color changes. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure."
