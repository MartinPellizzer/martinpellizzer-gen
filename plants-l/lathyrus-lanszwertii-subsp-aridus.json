    "intro": "Lathyrus lanszwertii subsp. aridus, commonly known as the desert pea, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers, typically ranging in color from pink to purple, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its leaves are compound and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
