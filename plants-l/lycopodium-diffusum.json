    "intro": "Lycopodium diffusum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. Lycopodium diffusum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. It plays a significant role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
