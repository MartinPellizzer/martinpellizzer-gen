    "intro": "Lippia albicaulis, commonly known as white-flowered lippia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its foliage is used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Lippia albicaulis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
