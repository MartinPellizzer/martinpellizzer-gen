    "intro": "Lolium perenne var. vulgare, commonly known as perennial ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine blades, dense growth habit, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. This plant is widely used in turfgrass management due to its durability and rapid establishment. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly folded. Perennial ryegrass is also valued for its forage quality and ecological benefits in agricultural and ornamental settings."
