    "intro": "Lachnopylis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, white tomentose coating on its upper surface, which gives it a fluffy appearance. The thallus is typically greenish-gray, and it often grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. It is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it an indicator species for humid habitats. This lichen plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
