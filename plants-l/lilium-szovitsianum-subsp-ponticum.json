It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive white throat. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, slender stem that bears the floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or open woodland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
