    "intro": "Lysimachia ferruginea, commonly known as rusty willowherb, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in reddish-brown hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Lysimachia ferruginea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial to full sun."
