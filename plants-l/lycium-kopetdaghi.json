    "intro": "Lycium kopetdaghi, commonly known as the Kopetdag lycium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, red berries that are edible. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by the development of its fleshy, berry-like fruits. Lycium kopetdaghi is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
