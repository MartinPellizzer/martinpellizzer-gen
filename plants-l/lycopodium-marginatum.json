    "intro": "Lycopodium marginatum, commonly known as the ground pine, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a pine-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Lycopodium marginatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
