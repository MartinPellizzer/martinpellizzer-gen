    "intro": "Luciola spicata, commonly known as the spicate glowworm plant, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique glowing property is due to specialized structures called luciferin-containing cells. Luciola spicata is of interest to botanists and researchers studying bioluminescence in plant life."
