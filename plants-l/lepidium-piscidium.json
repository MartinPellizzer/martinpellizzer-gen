It is characterized by its upright stems and small, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small white or yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its roots are edible and have a peppery, spicy flavor similar to that of horseradish. Lepidium piscidium is commonly found in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches."
