    "intro": "Lepidosperma lineare var. humile, commonly known as the small flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly flattened. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wetland or aquatic environments, preferring still or slowly moving water. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
