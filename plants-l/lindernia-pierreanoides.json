    "intro": "Lindernia pierreanoides, commonly known as the dwarf lindernia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
