    "intro": "Lycopodioides muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a compact, cushion-like growth form. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Lycopodioides muelleri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
