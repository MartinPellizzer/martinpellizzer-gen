    "intro": "Loranthus kannelii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host's leaves. The plant has small, oval leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other small animals. This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia."
