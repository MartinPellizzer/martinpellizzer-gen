    "intro": "Lappula deflexa, commonly known as the bent-lappula, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that aids in wind dispersal."
