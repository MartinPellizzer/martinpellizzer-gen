    "intro": "Leptadenia lanceolata subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern spearthorn, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain elliptical seeds. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. This species is also valued for its traditional uses in local medicine."
