    "intro": "Ligustrum syringiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, and usually oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and fast growth rate. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
