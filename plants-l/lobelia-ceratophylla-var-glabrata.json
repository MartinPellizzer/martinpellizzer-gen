    "intro": "Lobelia ceratophylla var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, smooth leaves and clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety 'glabrata' distinguishes itself from the typical lobelia by its lack of hairy foliage."
