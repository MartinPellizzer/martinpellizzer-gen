    "intro": "Lycopodium integerrimum, commonly known as the stiff clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. Lycopodium integerrimum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
