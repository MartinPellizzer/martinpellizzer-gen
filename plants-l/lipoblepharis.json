    "intro": "Lipoblepharis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, featuring a specialized lip or labellum that often resembles a hood or pouch. They are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Lipoblepharis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Their flowers are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
