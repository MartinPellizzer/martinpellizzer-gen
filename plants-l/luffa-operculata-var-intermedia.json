    "intro": "Luffa operculata var. intermedia, commonly known as the African luffa or wild sponge gourd, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its rough, fibrous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, ridged fruits that mature to a pale yellow or white color. The fruit's inner fibrous material, known as luffa, is used in traditional crafts and as a natural exfoliant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
