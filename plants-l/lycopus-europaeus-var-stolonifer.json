    "intro": "Lycopus europaeus var. stolonifer, commonly known as blueweed or creeping bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, blue to purple flowers in clusters. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly by runners, forming dense mats. This species is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
