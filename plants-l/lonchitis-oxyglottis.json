    "intro": "Lonchitis oxyglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowering stems produce small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The species is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
