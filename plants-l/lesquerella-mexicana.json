    "intro": "Lesquerella mexicana, commonly known as Mexican lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and latex-producing structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to dry and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lesquerella mexicana is known for producing seeds that are rich in oils, making it of interest for potential agricultural and industrial uses."
