It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring.

Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
