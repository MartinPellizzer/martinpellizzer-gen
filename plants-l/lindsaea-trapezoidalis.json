    "intro": "Lindsaea trapezoidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with the fronds often exhibiting a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Lindsaea trapezoidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
