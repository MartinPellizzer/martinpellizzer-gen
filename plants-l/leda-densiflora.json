    "intro": "Leda densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ledum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or bog habitats. Leda densiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
