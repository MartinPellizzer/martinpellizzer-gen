    "intro": "Liparis cordiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Liparis cordiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
