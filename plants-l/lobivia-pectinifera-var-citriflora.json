    "intro": "Lobivia pectinifera var. citriflora, commonly known as the Citrus Lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which are often followed by edible, citrus-scented fruits. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique fragrance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
