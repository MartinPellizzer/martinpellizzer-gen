    "intro": "Leptothamnus ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Leptothamnus ciliaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
