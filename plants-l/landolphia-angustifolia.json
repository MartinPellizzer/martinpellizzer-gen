    "intro": "Landolphia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf African morning glory, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is characterized by its long, twisting stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Landolphia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
