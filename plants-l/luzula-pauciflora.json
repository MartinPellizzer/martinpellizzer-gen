    "intro": "Luzula pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its limited floral display, with only a few flowers per cluster, giving it its common name."
