    "intro": "Lophosoria frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a loose cluster, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. Lophosoria frigida is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features make it a unique and relatively rare species within the orchid family."
