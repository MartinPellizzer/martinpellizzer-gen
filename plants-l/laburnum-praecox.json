It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation. Laburnum praecox is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
