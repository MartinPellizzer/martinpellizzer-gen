    "intro": "Lagotis ikonnikovii, commonly known as the Ikonnikov's lagotis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
