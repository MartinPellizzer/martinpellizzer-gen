    "intro": "Lantana milne-redheadii, commonly known as the redhead lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in many regions outside its native range."
