    "intro": "Licania myrsinoides, commonly known as the red-flowered licania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Licania myrsinoides plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
