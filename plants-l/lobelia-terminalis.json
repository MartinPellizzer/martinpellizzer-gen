    "intro": "Lobelia terminalis, commonly known as the trailing lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lobelia terminalis is often used in landscaping for its ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets."
