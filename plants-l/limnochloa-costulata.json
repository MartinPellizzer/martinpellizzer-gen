    "intro": "Limnochloa costulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with a distinctive ribbed structure along the leaf surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually found in dense clusters near the water's surface. Limnochloa costulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
