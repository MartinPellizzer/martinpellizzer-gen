    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. alpina, commonly known as alpine goatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish to purplish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
