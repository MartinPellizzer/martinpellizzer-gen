    "intro": "Linaria reflexa var. lubbockii, commonly known as the Lubbock linaria, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, linear seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry, rocky environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
