    "intro": "Limonium rigidum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual impact."
