    "intro": "Lachemilla holosericea, commonly known as the silky stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
