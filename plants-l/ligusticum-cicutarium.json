    "intro": "Ligusticum cicutarium, commonly known as herb of grace, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features a stout, hollow stem with opposite, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ligusticum cicutarium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
