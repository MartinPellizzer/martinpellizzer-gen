    "intro": "Leucadendron aurantiacum, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red bracts that surround its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
