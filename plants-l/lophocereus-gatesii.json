    "intro": "Lophocereus gatesii, commonly known as the Gates' night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring spines for protection and reduced leaves to minimize water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are active during the night. Lophocereus gatesii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
