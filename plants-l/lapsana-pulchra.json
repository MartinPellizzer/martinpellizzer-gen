    "intro": "Lapsana pulchra, commonly known as the pretty yellow weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Lapsana pulchra is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
