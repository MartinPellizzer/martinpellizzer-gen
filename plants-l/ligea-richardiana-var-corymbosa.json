    "intro": "Ligea richardiana var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered ligea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its stems are covered in fine, hairy textures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
