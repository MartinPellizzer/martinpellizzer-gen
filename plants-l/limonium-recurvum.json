    "intro": "Limonium recurvum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. Limonium recurvum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
