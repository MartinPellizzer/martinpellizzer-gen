It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in yellow or white. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
