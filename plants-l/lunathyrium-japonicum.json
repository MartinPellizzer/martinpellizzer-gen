    "intro": "Lunathyrium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese moonwort, is a rare and delicate fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that emerge from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a unique reproductive structure with a spore-bearing sorus located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
