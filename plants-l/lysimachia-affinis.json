    "intro": "Lysimachia affinis, commonly known as golden thread, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist woodlands and stream banks in North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Lysimachia affinis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
