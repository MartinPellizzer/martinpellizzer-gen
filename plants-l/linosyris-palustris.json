    "intro": "Linosyris palustris, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in damp or marshy habitats. It grows in dense clusters, often forming mats on the ground. Linosyris palustris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
