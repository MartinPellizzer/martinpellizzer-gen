    "intro": "Leontonyx tinctus, commonly known as the red-tipped bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-tipped petals and blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It has a compact, shrub-like appearance with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
