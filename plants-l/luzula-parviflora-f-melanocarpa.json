    "intro": "Luzula parviflora f. melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, upright leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear dark purple to black flowers, which are typical of the species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, often in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or streambanks. The dark-colored fruits of this form are a distinguishing feature, setting it apart from other varieties within the Luzula genus."
