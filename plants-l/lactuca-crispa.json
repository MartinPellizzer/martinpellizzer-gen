    "intro": "Lactuca crispa, commonly known as curled lettuce, is a species of lettuce native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its crinkled, ruffled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are often used in salads, though they are less common than other lettuce varieties. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other flowering plants."
