    "intro": "Lepisorus pteropus, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Lepisorus pteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
