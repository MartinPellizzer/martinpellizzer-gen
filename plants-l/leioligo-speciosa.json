    "intro": "Leioligo speciosa, commonly known as the golden torch fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Leioligo speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
