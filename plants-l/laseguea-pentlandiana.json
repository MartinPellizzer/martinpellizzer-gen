    "intro": "Laseguea pentlandiana, commonly known as the Pentland's lousewort, is a small flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-red flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, acidic habitat. It blooms from June to August and is often found in open, sunny areas. Laseguea pentlandiana is a rare species, listed as endangered in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
