It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.
