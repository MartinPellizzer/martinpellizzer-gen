    "intro": "Leucanthemum alpinum var. pseudotomentosum, commonly known as the Alpine oxeye daisy, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are densely covered with fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy white ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, creating a daisy-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in gardens with similar conditions."
