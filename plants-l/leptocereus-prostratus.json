    "intro": "Leptocereus prostratus, commonly known as the low cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a sprawling, low-growing plant with cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The low cholla is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can provide habitat for various desert animals."
