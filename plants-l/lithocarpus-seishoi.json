    "intro": "Lithocarpus seishoi, commonly known as the Japanese ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts. It is a deciduous tree native to Japan, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and dense, hard wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically edible, though they are not commonly cultivated for food. Lithocarpus seishoi is valued for its durable timber and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
