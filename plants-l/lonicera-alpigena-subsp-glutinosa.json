    "intro": "Lonicera alpigena subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the sticky, viscous sap that exudes from the stems, which can be used as a natural adhesive. This subspecies is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
