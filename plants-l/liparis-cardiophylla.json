    "intro": "Liparis cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
