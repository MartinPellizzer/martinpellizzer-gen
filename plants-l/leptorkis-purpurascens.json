It is characterized by its striking purple stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
