    "intro": "Linaria tenuis var. brachyloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf toadflax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
