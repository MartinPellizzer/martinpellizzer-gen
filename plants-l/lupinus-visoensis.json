    "intro": "Lupinus visoensis, commonly known as the Visoensis lupine, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus visoensis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
