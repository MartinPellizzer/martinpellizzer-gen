    "intro": "Lindernia cruciformis, commonly known as the four-angled lindernia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in spikes along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Lindernia cruciformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
