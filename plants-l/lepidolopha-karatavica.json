    "intro": "Lepidolopha karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Lepidolopha karatavica is considered a species of conservation concern."
