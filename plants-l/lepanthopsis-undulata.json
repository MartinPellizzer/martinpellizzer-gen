    "intro": "Lepanthopsis undulata, commonly known as the wavy lepanthopsis, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features a short, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms during the rainy season. Lepanthopsis undulata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study."
