    "intro": "Lotus capillipes, commonly known as the slender water lotus, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots grow in the muddy substrates of ponds and lakes, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Lotus capillipes is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
