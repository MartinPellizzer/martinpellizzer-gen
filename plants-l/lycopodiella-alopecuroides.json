    "intro": "Lycopodiella alopecuroides, commonly known as the mossy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodiella alopecuroides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
