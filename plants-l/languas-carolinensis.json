    "intro": "Languas carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pink flowers with a slight fragrance. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the Carolinas, and it is often found in moist, sunny habitats. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
