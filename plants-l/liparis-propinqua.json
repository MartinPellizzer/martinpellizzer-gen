    "intro": "Liparis propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a small, terrestrial herb with delicate, grass-like leaves and slender stems that produce clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Liparis propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
