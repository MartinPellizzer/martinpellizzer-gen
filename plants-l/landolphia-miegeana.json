    "intro": "Landolphia miegeana, commonly known as the African moon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a strong, sometimes unpleasant taste. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
