    "intro": "Luziola divergens, commonly known as the divergent bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals that curve outward, and it is pollinated primarily by bees. Luziola divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
