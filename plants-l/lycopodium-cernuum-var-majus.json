    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. majus, commonly known as the greater clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, compact clusters of bright green, needle-like leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
