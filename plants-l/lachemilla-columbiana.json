    "intro": "Lachemilla columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia sedum, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that form a mat-like structure, often carpeting rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral display. It is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is drought-tolerant once established. Lachemilla columbiana is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
