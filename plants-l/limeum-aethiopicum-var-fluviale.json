It features whorled leaves that radiate from a central stem, creating a wheel-like appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to oxygenate water."
