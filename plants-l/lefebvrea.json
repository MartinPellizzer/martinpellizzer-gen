    "intro": "Lefebvrea, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including moist woodlands and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their opposite leaves, which are often heart-shaped or ovate, and their small, inconspicuous flowers. Some species produce berries that are edible, though they are generally not widely cultivated. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
