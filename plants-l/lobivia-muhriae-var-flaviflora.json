    "intro": "Lobivia muhriae var. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered lobivia, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in its harsh environment. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
