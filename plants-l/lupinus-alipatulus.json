    "intro": "Lupinus alipatulus, commonly known as the alpine lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus alipatulus is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
