    "intro": "Lathyrus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet flax or red vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that produces vibrant red or pink pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces long, cylindrical seed pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus coccineus is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
