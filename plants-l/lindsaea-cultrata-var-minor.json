    "intro": "Lindsaea cultrata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf lindsaea, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
