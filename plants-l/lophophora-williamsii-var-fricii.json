    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. fricii, commonly known as the \"Corky\" peyote, is a variant of the peyote cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is a slow-growing, low-maintenance cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also known for its cultural and spiritual significance among certain indigenous communities."
