    "intro": "Lonicera californica, commonly known as California honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall and serves as a food source for birds and small mammals."
