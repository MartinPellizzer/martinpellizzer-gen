    "intro": "Lycopodioides rupestris, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, where it forms dense mats on stone surfaces. The plant has primitive vascular structures, including rhizomes and leaves that are usually scale-like. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of the stems, and it relies on wind pollination. Lycopodioides rupestris is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
