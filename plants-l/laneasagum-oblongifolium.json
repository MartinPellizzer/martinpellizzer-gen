    "intro": "Laneasagum oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf paperbark, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of white, pink, and green. The leaves are oblong and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
