    "intro": "Lasianthus tsangii, commonly known as the Chinese flameflower, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Lasianthus tsangii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
