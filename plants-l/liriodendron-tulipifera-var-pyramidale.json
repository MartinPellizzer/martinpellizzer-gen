    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera var. pyramidale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tulip tree, is a variant of the tulip tree characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces distinctive tulip-shaped flowers in the spring, which are yellow-green with a red blotch at the base. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens and landscapes."
