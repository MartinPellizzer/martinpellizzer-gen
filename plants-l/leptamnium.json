    "intro": "Leptamnium, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often spiny leaves and showy, usually yellow or orange flowers. These plants are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where they thrive in rocky or arid environments. Leptamnium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals in their native ecosystems."
