    "intro": "Leucothoe floribunda, commonly known as the fragrant leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, upright growth with elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are often fragrant. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter, providing food for wildlife. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
