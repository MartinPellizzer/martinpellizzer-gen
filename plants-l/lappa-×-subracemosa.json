    "intro": "Lappa \u00d7 subracemosa, commonly known as the hybrid giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces showy, umbrella-like inflorescences with small white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and pose a risk to human health due to its phototoxic sap."
