    "intro": "Lycopodioides victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its morphology reflects adaptations to a primitive, spore-reproducing lifestyle. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
