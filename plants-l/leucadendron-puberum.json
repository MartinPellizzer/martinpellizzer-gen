    "intro": "Leucadendron puberum, commonly known as the silver tree, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces cone-like structures called infructescences, which are often brightly colored and serve as a means of attracting seed-dispersing animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is a popular choice for gardens in arid climates."
