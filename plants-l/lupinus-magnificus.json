    "intro": "Lupinus magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant purple or blue pea-like flowers. The plant produces large, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Lupinus magnificus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
