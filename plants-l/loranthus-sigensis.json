    "intro": "Loranthus sigensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Acacia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant species in African savanna ecosystems. Loranthus sigensis plays a role in supporting bird populations by providing a food source through its berries."
