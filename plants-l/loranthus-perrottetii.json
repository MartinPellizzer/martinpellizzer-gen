    "intro": "Loranthus perrottetii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of new host trees. This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
