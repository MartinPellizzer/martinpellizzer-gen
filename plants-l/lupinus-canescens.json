    "intro": "Lupinus canescens, commonly known as the silver lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and tall spires of blue or purple flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Lupinus canescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
