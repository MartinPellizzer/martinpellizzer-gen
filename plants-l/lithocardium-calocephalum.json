It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Lithocardium calocephalum is often found in coastal and mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils."
