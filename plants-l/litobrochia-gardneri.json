    "intro": "Litobrochia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's rock-mahoe, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
