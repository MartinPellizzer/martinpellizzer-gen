    "intro": "Lepidocaryum quadripartitum, commonly known as the four-parted lepidocaryum, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with four lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and it is known for its unusual fruit structure, which splits into four parts at maturity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Lepidocaryum quadripartitum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
