    "intro": "Liparis torta, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a slender, often twisted stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Liparis torta thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake."
