It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow-centered flowers with white petals, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
