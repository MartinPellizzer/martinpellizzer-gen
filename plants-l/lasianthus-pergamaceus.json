    "intro": "Lasianthus pergamaceus, commonly known as the paperleaf flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and waxy, resembling parchment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
