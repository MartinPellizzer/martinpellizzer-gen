    "intro": "Lomatium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often found in regions with mild, temperate climates, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is sometimes considered a rare or threatened species in certain areas."
