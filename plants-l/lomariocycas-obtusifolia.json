    "intro": "Lomariocycas obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male and female cones typically found on separate plants. Native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
