    "intro": "Ligustrum rufum, commonly known as the red-fruited privet, is a deciduous shrub native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
