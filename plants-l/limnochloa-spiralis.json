    "intro": "Limnochloa spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, spirally twisted stems that rise from a dense, mat-like root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Limnochloa spiralis thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams and in wetlands."
