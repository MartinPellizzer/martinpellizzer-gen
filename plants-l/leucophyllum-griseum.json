    "intro": "Leucophyllum griseum, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardens in dry climates."
