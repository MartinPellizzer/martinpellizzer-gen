    "intro": "Lupinus omalophyllus, commonly known as the coastal lupin, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Lupinus omalophyllus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
