    "intro": "Lespedeza glauca, commonly known as blue lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Blue lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
