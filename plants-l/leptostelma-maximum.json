    "intro": "Leptostelma maximum, commonly known as the giant star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, closely packed leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Leptostelma maximum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
