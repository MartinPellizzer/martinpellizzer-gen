    "intro": "Loranthus vegetus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological factor in forest ecosystems. Its presence can affect the health and growth of the host tree."
