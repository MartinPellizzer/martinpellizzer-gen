    "intro": "Lomaria acrodonta, commonly known as the acrodont lomaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
