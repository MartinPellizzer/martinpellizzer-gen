It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
