    "intro": "Lupinus asymbepus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Lupinus asymbepus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
