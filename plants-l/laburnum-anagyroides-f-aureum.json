It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that appear in long, drooping clusters, typically in late spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, native to the British Isles and widely cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are compound, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The golden laburnum is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
