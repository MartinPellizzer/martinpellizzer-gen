    "intro": "Linum setaceum, commonly known as the slender flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Linum setaceum is adapted to drought conditions, featuring deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. It is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
