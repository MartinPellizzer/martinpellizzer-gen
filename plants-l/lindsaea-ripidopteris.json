    "intro": "Lindsaea ripidopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are often covered with a brown, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Lindsaea ripidopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
