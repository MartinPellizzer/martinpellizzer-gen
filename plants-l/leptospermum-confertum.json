    "intro": "Leptospermum confertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tea tree, is a shrub native to Tasmania and southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
