    "intro": "Leptosiphon heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and blue. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions, a trait known as heterophyllous variation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
