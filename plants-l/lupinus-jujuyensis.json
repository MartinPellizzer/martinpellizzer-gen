    "intro": "Lupinus jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of violet or blue flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Lupinus jujuyensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or arid soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
