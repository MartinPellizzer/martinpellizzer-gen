    "intro": "Lupinus pucapucensis, commonly known as the Pucapuc Valley lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of vibrant blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with multiple small leaflets, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Lupinus pucapucensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
