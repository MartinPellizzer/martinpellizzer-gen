    "intro": "Lepidium muelleriferdinandii, commonly known as Mueller's wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
