    "intro": "Lycopodium meridense, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to Mexico and Central America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are characteristic of the lycophyte group. Lycopodium meridense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
