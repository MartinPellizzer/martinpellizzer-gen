    "intro": "Lepanthes titanica, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This species is notable for its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as white, yellow, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to capture humidity in its humid, shaded habitat. Lepanthes titanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
