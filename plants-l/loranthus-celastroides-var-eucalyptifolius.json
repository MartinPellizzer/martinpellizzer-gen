    "intro": "Loranthus celastroides var. eucalyptifolius, commonly known as the eucalyptus-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of eucalyptus trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients from its host through haustoria. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble eucalyptus foliage, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and tropical regions."
