    "intro": "Leontodon nudicaulis subsp. mesorrhynchus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hawk's-beard, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its subspecific name, *mesorrhynchus*, refers to its relatively narrow flower tubes, distinguishing it from other subspecies of *Leontodon nudicaulis*."
