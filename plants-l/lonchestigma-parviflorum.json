    "intro": "Lonchestigma parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered starwort, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster, and the leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped. Lonchestigma parviflorum is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
