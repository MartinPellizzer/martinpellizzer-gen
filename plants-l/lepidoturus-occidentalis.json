    "intro": "Lepidoturus occidentalis, commonly known as the western spiny softshell turtle, is a freshwater turtle species native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, leathery shell and distinctive spines along the edges of its carapace. This species typically inhabits slow-moving rivers and lakes with muddy bottoms. The turtle's diet consists mainly of aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and plant matter. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Lepidoturus occidentalis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
