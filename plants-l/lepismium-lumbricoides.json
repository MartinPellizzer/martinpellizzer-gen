    "intro": "Lepismium lumbricoides, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
