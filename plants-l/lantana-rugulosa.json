    "intro": "Lantana rugulosa, commonly known as the rough lantana, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, orange, and red. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Lantana rugulosa is also known for its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
