    "intro": "Linaria tristis var. typica, commonly known as the weedy toadflax, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
