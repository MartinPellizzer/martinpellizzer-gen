    "intro": "Lycaste leucantha, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals with a pinkish lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
