    "intro": "Leiothrix affinis, commonly known as the creeping forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features long, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread across the forest floor. Leiothrix affinis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
