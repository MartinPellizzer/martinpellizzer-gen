    "intro": "Lychnophora rosmarinus, commonly known as Brazilian rosemary, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that emit a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties. Lychnophora rosmarinus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
