    "intro": "Latrobea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Proteaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-like blooms that appear in late summer, often in shades of white and pink. The plant is typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Latrobea is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
