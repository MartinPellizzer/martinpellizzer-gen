    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. compositum, commonly known as Italian ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fine-textured leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It is often used in forage production due to its high nutritional value and rapid establishment. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
