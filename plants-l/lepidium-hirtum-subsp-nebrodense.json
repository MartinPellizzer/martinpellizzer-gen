    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum subsp. nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodensis cress, is a small annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
