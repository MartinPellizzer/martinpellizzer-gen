    "intro": "Lavatera rupestris, commonly known as the rock lavender, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces showy, woolly flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Lavatera rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
