    "intro": "Lastrea odorata, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky, nectar-like substance to lure insects. The plant's botanical features include a short, erect stem and waxy, broad leaves that form the trapping structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its carnivorous adaptations. The species is notable for its attractive appearance and specialized ecological role in nutrient-poor soils."
