    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea subsp. longipetala, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or purple flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
