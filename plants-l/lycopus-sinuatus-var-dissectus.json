    "intro": "Lycopus sinuatus var. dissectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, gray-green leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, damp areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the mint family (Lamiaceae)."
