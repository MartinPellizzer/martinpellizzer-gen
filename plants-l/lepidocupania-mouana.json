    "intro": "Lepidocupania mouana, commonly known as the Pacific island lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus that is typically green or yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the majority of its nutrition through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on tree trunks and rocks in coastal and rainforest regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
