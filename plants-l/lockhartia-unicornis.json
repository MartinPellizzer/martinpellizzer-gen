    "intro": "Lockhartia unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the highlands of Ecuador, it is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a unicorn's horn. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, Lockhartia unicornis is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
