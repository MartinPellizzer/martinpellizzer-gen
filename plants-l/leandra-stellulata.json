    "intro": "Leandra stellulata, commonly known as the star-leaved leandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with small, star-shaped markings. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
