    "intro": "Lysimachia paridiformis, commonly known as the creeping jew's-mary, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats over the ground."
