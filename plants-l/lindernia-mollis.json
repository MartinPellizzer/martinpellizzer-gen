It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple, arranged in spikes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
