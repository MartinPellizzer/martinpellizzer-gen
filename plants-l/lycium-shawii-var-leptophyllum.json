    "intro": "Lycium shawii var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but typically have a tart flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
