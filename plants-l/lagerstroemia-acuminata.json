    "intro": "Lagerstroemia acuminata, commonly known as the crape myrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has smooth, peeling bark that becomes mottled with age, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
