    "intro": "Loasa peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Loasa peltata is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and stream banks. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
