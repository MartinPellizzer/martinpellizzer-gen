    "intro": "Lithospermum incanum, commonly known as the hairy lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to further conserve moisture. Lithospermum incanum is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
