    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. heteroloba, commonly known as the heteroloba twinflower, is a rare botanical variant of the twinflower plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, two-lipped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to northern regions of North America and parts of Asia, growing in cool, moist habitats. It has small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy, and its stems are slender and creeping. This form is notable for its genetic variation and is of interest to botanists studying plant morphology and evolution."
