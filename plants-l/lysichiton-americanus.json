It features a rosette of broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a short inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and wetlands. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds that can cause severe poisoning if ingested."
