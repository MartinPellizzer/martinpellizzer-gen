    "intro": "Lupinus sparsiflorus var. barbatulus, commonly known as the hairy lupin, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Lupinus sparsiflorus var. barbatulus plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
