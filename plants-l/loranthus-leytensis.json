    "intro": "Loranthus leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Philippines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forest ecosystems."
