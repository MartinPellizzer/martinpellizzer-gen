    "intro": "Libanotis unicaulis, commonly known as the single-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
