    "intro": "Loxogramme grandis, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features distinctive, lobed leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it can absorb moisture through its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Loxogramme grandis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
