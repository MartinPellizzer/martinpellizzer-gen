    "intro": "Lissera germanica, commonly known as the German bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Lissera germanica is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
