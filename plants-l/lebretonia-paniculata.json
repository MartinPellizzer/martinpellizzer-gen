    "intro": "Lebretonia paniculata, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Lebretonia paniculata is also valued for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and poor soil conditions."
