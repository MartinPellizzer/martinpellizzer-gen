It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Lysimachia hirsuta is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
