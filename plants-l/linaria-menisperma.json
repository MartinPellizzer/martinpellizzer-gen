    "intro": "Linaria menisperma, commonly known as the common toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of yellow-orange, spurred flowers that resemble small toads, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Linaria menisperma is a perennial herb that is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
