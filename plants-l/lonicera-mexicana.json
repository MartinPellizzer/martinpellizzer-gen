    "intro": "Lonicera mexicana, commonly known as Mexican honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are red berries that mature in the fall and are edible for both humans and wildlife. Lonicera mexicana is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
