    "intro": "Lactuca tephrocarpa, commonly known as the sand lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, succulent, and sometimes edible, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other lettuce species. Lactuca tephrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
