    "intro": "Launaea lackii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Launaea lackii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
