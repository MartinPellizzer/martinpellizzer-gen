    "intro": "Lithops weberi, commonly known as the \"Living Stone,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble rocks, helping it blend into its arid environment. The plant stores water in its leaves, which are typically gray-green in color with distinctive markings. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the growing season, usually in spring. Lithops weberi is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and requires minimal watering to thrive."
