    "intro": "Leucothoe grayana var. pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and showy clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a waxy, silvery-white underside that gives the plant its distinguishing appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
