It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance."
