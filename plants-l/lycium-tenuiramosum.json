    "intro": "Lycium tenuiramosum, commonly known as the slender-fruited boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Lycium tenuiramosum is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
