    "intro": "Listrostachys caudata, commonly known as the cat-tail sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts resembling a cat's tail. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Listrostachys caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
