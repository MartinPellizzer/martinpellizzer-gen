    "intro": "Lewisia pygmaea var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lewisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to magenta flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
