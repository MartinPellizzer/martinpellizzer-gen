    "intro": "Lepanthes striatifolia, commonly known as the striped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly patterned, often green or white flowers with prominent dark markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on tree roots or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small to medium-sized and bloom during the warmer months of the year. Lepanthes striatifolia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
