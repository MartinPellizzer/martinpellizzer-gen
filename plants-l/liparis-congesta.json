    "intro": "Liparis congesta, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a dense cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral along the stem. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Liparis congesta is notable for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
