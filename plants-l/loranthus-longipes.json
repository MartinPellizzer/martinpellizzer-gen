    "intro": "Loranthus longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female plants, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for birds and insects."
