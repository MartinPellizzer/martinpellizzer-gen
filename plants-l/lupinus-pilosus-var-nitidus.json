    "intro": "Lupinus pilosus var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its species name \"pilosus.\" The variety \"nitidus\" refers to its smooth, glossy appearance compared to the more hairy standard form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along mountain slopes."
