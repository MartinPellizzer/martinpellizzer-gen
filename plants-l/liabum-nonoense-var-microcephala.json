    "intro": "Liabum nonoense var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions make it a hardy ornamental plant. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
