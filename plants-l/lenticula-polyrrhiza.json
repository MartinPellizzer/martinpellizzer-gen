    "intro": "Lenticula polyrrhiza, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
