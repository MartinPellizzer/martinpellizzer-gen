    "intro": "Lespedeza floribunda, commonly known as the pinkwood or redstem lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a fine texture, while its stems are usually reddish in color. Lespedeza floribunda is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
