    "intro": "Lepanthes mastodon, commonly known as the mastodon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale green in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes mastodon is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
