    "intro": "Linaria bipartita subsp. affougueurensis, commonly known as the Affougueur's toadflax, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
