    "intro": "Leiothrix umbratilis var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed leiothrix, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually a deep green color. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pale yellow to white hue, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist forest understory environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
