    "intro": "Lepanthes sanchoi, commonly known as the Sancho's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. Lepanthes sanchoi is known for its compact size and is often found in association with mosses and other epiphytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
