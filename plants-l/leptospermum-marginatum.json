    "intro": "Leptospermum marginatum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, narrow leaves with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in coastal environments and is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Its aromatic foliage has been traditionally used in Indigenous Australian cultures for various purposes."
