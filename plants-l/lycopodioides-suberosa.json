    "intro": "Lycopodioides suberosa, commonly known as the rough lycopod, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophytes that are often woody and branched, with a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas, and is often found in temperate regions. The reproductive structures, including strobili, are borne on the upper parts of the plant and contain the spores necessary for its propagation."
