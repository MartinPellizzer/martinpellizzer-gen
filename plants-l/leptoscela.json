    "intro": "Leptoscela, commonly known as the African violet or African violet-like plants, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their striking, showy flowers. They typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in their native habitats. Leptoscela species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. Their botanical features make them popular in both horticulture and botanical research."
