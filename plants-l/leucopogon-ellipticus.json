It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths, heathers, and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in sandy or acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Leucopogon ellipticus is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can regenerate quickly after bushfires."
