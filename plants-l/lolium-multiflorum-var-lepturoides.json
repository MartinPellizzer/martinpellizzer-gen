    "intro": "Lolium multiflorum var. lepturoides, commonly known as slender ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It has a fine texture and is sometimes used in forage production due to its high nutritional value. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
