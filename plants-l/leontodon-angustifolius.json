It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in rough, hairy texture, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a serrated edge. The yellow flowers bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
