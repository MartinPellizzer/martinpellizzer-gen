    "intro": "Lepanthes holoserica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and elongated, pendulous flowers that often appear in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Lepanthes holoserica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
