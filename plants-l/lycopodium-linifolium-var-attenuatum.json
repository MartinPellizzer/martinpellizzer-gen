    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium var. attenuatum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its foliage forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
