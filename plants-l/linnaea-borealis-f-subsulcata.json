    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subsulcata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies subsulcata is distinguished by its narrower leaf margins and slightly depressed midrib, setting it apart from the typical form. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This plant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
