    "intro": "Lomelosia graminifolia subsp. arizagae, commonly known as Arizona feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or open woodlands. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
