    "intro": "Linaria peltieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre linaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Linaria peltieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
