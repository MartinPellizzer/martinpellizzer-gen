    "intro": "Lysistigma peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces long, slender stems that bear the blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Lysistigma peregrinum is an important species for pollinators and adds aesthetic value to its native habitat."
