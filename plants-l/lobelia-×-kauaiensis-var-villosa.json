    "intro": "Lobelia \u00d7 kauaiensis var. villosa, commonly known as the Kauai lobelia, is a rare and unique plant endemic to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a hybrid species within the Lobelia genus, characterized by its hairy, or villosa, appearance due to the dense pubescence on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest understories. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
