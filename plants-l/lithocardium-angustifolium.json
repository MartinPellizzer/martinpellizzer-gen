    "intro": "Lithocardium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lithocardium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and the plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Lithocardium angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
