It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
