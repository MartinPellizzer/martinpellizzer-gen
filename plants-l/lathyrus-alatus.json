    "intro": "Lathyrus alatus, commonly known as the trailing pea or evergreen pea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lathyrus alatus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
