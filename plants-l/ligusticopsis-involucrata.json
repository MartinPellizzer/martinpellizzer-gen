    "intro": "Ligusticopsis involucrata, commonly known as the clustered ligusticum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Ligusticopsis involucrata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
