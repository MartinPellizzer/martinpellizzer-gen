    "intro": "Lachnagrostis nesomytica subsp. paralia, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to salt and wind exposure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, contributing to dune stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
