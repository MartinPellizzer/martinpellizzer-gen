    "intro": "Lantana camara f. rosea, commonly known as the roseum lantana, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to lavender, with a striking contrast between the vivid petals and the dark green foliage. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic leaves and rapid growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can be invasive in some regions and requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
