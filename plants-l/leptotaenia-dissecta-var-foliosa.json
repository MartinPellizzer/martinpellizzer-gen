    "intro": "Leptotaenia dissecta var. foliosa, commonly known as the dissected leaf leptotaenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
