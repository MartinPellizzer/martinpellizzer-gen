    "intro": "Lupinus opertospicus, commonly known as the closed-spore lupine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically arranged in dense spikes. Its unique feature is the closed spore structure on its pods, which distinguishes it from other lupine species. Lupinus opertospicus is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in dry slopes and open woodlands."
