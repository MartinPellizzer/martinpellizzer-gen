    "intro": "Lupinus lacteus, commonly known as the milk vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pea-like, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Lupinus lacteus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
