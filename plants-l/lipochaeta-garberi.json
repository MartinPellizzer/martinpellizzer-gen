    "intro": "Lipochaeta garberi, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Lipochaeta garberi is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as dunes and coastal scrub."
