    "intro": "Lobularia canariensis subsp. intermedia, commonly known as Canary Island lobularia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate and are covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive blooms and drought tolerance."
