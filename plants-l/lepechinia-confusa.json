    "intro": "Lepechinia confusa, commonly known as the slender lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its small size and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its arid environment. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
