    "intro": "Lolium saxatile, commonly known as the alpine ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Lolium saxatile is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and as a forage plant for livestock."
