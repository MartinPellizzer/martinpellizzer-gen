    "intro": "Lespedeza pubescens, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Hairy lespedeza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
