It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
