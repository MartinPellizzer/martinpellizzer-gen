    "intro": "Lobelia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. Lobelia pilosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
