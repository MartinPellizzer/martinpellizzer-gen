    "intro": "Lecythis praealta, commonly known as the giant lecythium, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The tree produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange-colored aril. Its bark is thick and corky, providing natural defenses against pests and environmental stress. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for potential medicinal properties."
