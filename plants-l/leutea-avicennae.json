    "intro": "Leutea avicennae, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shores. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Leutea avicennae plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
