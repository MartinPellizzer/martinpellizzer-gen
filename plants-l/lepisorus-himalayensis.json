    "intro": "Lepisorus himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found at high altitudes. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
