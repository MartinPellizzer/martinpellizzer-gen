    "intro": "Lugonia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered lugonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
