    "intro": "Ligularia robusta, commonly known as the giant dock, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a dark green or bronze coloration. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its bold foliage and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, shade-tolerant plant."
