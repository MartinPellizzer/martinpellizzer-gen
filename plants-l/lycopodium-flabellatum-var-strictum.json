    "intro": "Lycopodium flabellatum var. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Lycopodium flabellatum."
