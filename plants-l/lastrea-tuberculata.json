    "intro": "Lastrea tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The leaves are small, oval, and often shed during periods of drought. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance."
