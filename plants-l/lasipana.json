    "intro": "Lasipana, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Lasipana thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
