    "intro": "Lycium venturii, commonly known as the Venturi boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Lycium venturii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
