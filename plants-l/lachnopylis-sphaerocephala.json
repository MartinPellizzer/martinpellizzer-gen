    "intro": "Lachnopylis sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed lichen, is a species of foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, rounded thallus. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate to subarctic regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an indicator species for environmental conditions."
