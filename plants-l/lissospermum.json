These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Lissospermum species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
