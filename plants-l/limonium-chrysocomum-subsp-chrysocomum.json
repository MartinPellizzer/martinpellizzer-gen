    "intro": "Limonium chrysocomum subsp. chrysocomum, commonly known as the golden limonium, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
