    "intro": "Lonicera phyllomachae, commonly known as the Mexican honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife. Lonicera phyllomachae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
