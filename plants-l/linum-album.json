    "intro": "Linum album, commonly known as white flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsules containing numerous small, oval seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence. Linum album is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
