    "intro": "Lonchomera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. The wood of some species is highly valued for its dense, dark color and durability, though it is now protected in many areas due to overharvesting. Lonchomera species play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
