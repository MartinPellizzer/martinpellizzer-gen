    "intro": "Lupinus bailettianus, commonly known as the Bailett's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules, which contribute to soil fertility. Lupinus bailettianus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
