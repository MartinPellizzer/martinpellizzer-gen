    "intro": "Leptogramma rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded forest floors, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves. Leptogramma rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
