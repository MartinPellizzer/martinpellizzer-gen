It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
