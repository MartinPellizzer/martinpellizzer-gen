    "intro": "Lipochaeta forbesii var. sherfii, commonly known as the coastal lipochaeta, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is noted for its resilience in harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
