    "intro": "Lonchocarpus savannicola, commonly known as the savanna legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, thanks to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody pod, which helps in seed dispersal and survival in harsh environments."
