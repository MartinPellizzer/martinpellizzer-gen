    "intro": "Lilium formosum, commonly known as the Formosa lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Liliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive red throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring strap-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in its native habitat, and the plant blooms in late summer to early autumn. The Formosa lily is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
