    "intro": "Lupinus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and spires of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Lupinus tomentosus typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it an important species in native plant restoration projects."
