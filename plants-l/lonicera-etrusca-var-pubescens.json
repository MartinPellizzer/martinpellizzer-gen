    "intro": "Lonicera etrusca var. pubescens, commonly known as the Etruscan honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems covered in fine pubescence, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
