    "intro": "Lewisia yosemitana, commonly known as Yosemita's Lewisia, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
