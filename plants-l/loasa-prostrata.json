    "intro": "Loasa prostrata, commonly known as creeping loasa, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
