    "intro": "Lilium myriophyllum, commonly known as the water lily, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant's leaves are usually rounded with a waxy surface that helps repel water, while its flowers can range in color from white to pink and yellow. Lilium myriophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
