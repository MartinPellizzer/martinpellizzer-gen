    "intro": "Leighia linearis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its long, slender, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Leighia linearis is considered a conservation concern."
