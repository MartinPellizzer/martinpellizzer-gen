    "intro": "Liparis kamborangensis, commonly known as the Kamboran orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It possesses a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
