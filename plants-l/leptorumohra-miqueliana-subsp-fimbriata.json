    "intro": "Leptorumohra miqueliana subsp. fimbriata, commonly known as the fimbriate leptorumohra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fimbriated (fringed) leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
