    "intro": "Lactuca spicata, commonly known as spiny lettuce, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically spiny or rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster, which gives it its scientific name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. While not commonly cultivated for food, it has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
