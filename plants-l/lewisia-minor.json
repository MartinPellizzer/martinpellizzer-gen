It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
