    "intro": "Larnastyra, commonly known as the red lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. The algal component provides energy through photosynthesis, while the fungus offers structural support and protection. Larnastyra exhibits a vibrant red or orange color due to the pigments produced by the algal cells. This symbiotic relationship allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions where individual organisms would struggle."
