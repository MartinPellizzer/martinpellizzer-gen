    "intro": "Lilium speciosum, commonly known as the showy lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers with six to eight recurved petals. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, typically in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Lilium speciosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens."
