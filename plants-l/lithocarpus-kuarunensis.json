    "intro": "Lithocarpus kuarunensis, commonly known as the Kuarun ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Lithocarpus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
