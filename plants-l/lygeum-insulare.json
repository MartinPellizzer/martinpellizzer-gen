    "intro": "Lygeum insulare, commonly known as the island bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often grow along the ground or in shallow water. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense mats. Lygeum insulare is adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy species in such conditions."
