    "intro": "Lathraea lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
