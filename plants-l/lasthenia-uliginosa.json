    "intro": "Lasthenia uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as wetlands and meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often resembling the appearance of heliotrope. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture. The species is adapted to wet conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
