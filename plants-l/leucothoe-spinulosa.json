    "intro": "Leucothoe spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dense, spiny branches that provide structural interest. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn reddish in the fall, adding ornamental value. Leucothoe spinulosa thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
