    "intro": "Larrea tridentata var. glutinosa, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and helps it survive in extreme conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
