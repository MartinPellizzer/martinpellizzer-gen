    "intro": "Lathyrus latifolius var. ensifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pea or swordleaf pea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its seeds are edible when young but become toxic if allowed to mature, making it important to harvest them promptly. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
