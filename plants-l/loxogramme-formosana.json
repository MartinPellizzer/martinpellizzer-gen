    "intro": "Loxogramme formosana, commonly known as the Formosan water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate. Loxogramme formosana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
