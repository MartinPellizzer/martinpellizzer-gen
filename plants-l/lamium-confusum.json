    "intro": "Lamium confusum, commonly known as the lesser deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes. Lamium confusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its ability to suppress weeds."
