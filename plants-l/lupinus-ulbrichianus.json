    "intro": "Lupinus ulbrichianus, commonly known as the Ulbrich's lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several elliptical seeds. Lupinus ulbrichianus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
