    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides var. contextum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, evergreen stems that bear scale-like leaves and produce cone-like structures called strobila. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly India, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures contain microspores and megaspores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species. The plant's morphology and spore production are typical of primitive vascular plants, showcasing evolutionary adaptations for survival in diverse habitats."
