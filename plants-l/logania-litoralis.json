    "intro": "Logania litoralis, commonly known as the coastal logania, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a small shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Logania litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
