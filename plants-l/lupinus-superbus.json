    "intro": "Lupinus superbus, commonly known as the tall lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus superbus is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
