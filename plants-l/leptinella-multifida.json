    "intro": "Leptinella multifida, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and wildflower displays."
