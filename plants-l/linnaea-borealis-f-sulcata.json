It is characterized by its distinctive, wrinkled leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical smooth leaves of the species. This plant is native to boreal and subarctic regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in pairs, resembling the shape of a twin, hence its common name. The f. sulcata form is particularly rare, making it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
