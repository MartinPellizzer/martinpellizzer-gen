It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that often branch out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
