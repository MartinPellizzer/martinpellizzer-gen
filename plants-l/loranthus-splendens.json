    "intro": "Loranthus splendens, commonly known as the shining mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host tree if left unchecked."
