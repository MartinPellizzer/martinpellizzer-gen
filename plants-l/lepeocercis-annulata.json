    "intro": "Lepeocercis annulata, commonly known as the ringed lichen, is a crustose lichen that grows on bark and stone in temperate regions. It is characterized by its distinctive concentric rings, which give it its common name. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth, powdery surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on decaying wood or tree trunks. This lichen is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecosystem health."
