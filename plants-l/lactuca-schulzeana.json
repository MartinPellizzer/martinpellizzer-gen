It is native to South America and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lactuca schulzeana is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
