    "intro": "Lycium pallidum var. oligospermum, commonly known as the pale lycium with few seeds, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red berries. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves and deep roots to conserve water. Its berries are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them suitable only for specific uses. This variant is distinguished by its reduced seed count compared to other Lycium species."
