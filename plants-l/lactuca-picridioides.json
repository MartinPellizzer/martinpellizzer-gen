    "intro": "Lactuca picridioides, commonly known as the bitter lettuce or wild lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into small, spiky fruits. It is characterized by the presence of a milky sap, which is a common trait among the genus Lactuca. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
