    "intro": "Lysimachia rupestris, commonly known as the rock johnny or mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and woodland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Lysimachia rupestris thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily in suitable conditions."
