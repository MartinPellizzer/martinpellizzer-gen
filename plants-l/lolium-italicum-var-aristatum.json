    "intro": "Lolium italicum var. aristatum, commonly known as the Italian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with the inflorescence bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value, it is widely used as forage for livestock."
