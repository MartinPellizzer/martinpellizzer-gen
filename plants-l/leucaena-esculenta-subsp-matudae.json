It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. Matudae leucaena is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
