    "intro": "Lycium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It features small, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and red berries that are edible but often bitter. Lycium brevipes is adapted to dry environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
