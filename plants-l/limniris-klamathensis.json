    "intro": "Limniris klamathensis, commonly known as Klamath lake lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Klamath Basin in Oregon and California. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, alkaline lakes and wetlands, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are long and ribbon-like, floating on the water's surface or submerged. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Limniris klamathensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
