It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.
