    "intro": "Listera ovata f. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed bluebell, is a variant of the common bluebell characterized by its trifoliate leaves. This plant belongs to the Primulaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soil. The flowers are bell-shaped, usually pale blue or white, and bloom in early spring. The trifoliate foliage distinguishes it from the typical two-leaf form of Listera ovata."
