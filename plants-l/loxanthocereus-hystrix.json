    "intro": "Loxanthocereus hystrix, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Loxanthocereus hystrix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
