It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, preferring moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Lunania uniflora is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
