    "intro": "Loranthus pendulus var. typicus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some organic compounds through photosynthesis using light captured by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which contain a single seed, are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit. This species is widely distributed across Australia and is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species."
