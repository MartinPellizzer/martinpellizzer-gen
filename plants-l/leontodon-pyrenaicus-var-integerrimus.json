    "intro": "Leontodon pyrenaicus var. integerrimus, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawk's-beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow ray florets and dense, spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
