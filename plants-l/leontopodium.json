    "intro": "Leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly white or pale yellow flowers surrounded by a layer of bracts. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and low temperatures. Its unique appearance and limited distribution have made it a symbol of resilience and purity. Due to its ecological significance and cultural symbolism, it is protected in many regions."
