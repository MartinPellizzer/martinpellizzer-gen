    "intro": "Lilium medeoloides f. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered death lily, is a striking variant of the death lily species. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers, which contrast sharply with its grass-like foliage. This perennial plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its unique coloration and ecological role make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
