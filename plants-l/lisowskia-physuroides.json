    "intro": "Lisowskia physuroides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
