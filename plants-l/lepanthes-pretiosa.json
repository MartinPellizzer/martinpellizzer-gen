It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, strap-shaped leaves and produces delicate, pink or purple flowers in a loose spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Lepanthes pretiosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
