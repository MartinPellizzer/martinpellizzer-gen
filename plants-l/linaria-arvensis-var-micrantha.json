    "intro": "Linaria arvensis var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its adaptability, it can be both a weed and a subject of botanical study in ecological contexts."
