It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky areas and has small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Lepidium latifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for arid environments."
