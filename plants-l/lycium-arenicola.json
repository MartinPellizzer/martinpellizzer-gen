    "intro": "Lycium arenicola, commonly known as the sand lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and red berries that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss. Lycium arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for local wildlife."
