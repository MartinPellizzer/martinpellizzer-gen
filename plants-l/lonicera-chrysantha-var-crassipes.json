    "intro": "Lonicera chrysantha var. crassipes, commonly known as the thick-stemmed honeysuckle, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners."
