    "intro": "Lycopodium magellanicum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls. This variety is notable for its compact size, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of clubmosses."
