    "intro": "Leucospermum cartilagineum, commonly known as the firewheel flower, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red, flame-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological plantings."
