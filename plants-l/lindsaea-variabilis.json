    "intro": "Lindsaea variabilis, commonly known as the variable lindsaea, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually divided into small, linear segments, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Lindsaea variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
