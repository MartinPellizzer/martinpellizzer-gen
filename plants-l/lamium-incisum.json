    "intro": "Lamium incisum, commonly known as greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of violet or purple flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in gardens. Lamium incisum is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin irritations and respiratory ailments."
