    "intro": "Loranthus odontocalyx var. proprius, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are red or orange berries containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds. This species is native to China and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive."
