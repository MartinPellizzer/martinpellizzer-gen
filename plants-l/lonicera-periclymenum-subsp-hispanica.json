It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, blooming in early spring. These flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and small mammals."
