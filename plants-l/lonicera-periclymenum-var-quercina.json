    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. quercina, commonly known as the oak-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or yellowish in color. These flowers give way to red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
