It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, orange, or yellow berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
