    "intro": "Ligularia pulchra, commonly known as the golden shield, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
