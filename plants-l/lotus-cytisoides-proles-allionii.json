    "intro": "Lotus cytisoides proles allionii, commonly known as the Allionii lotus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
