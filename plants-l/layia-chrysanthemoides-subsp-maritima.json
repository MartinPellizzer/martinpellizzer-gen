It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces yellow to orange flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important plant for coastal erosion control."
