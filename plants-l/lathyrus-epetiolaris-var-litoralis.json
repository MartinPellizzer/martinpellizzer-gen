    "intro": "Lathyrus epetiolaris var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal vetch, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and shorelines, demonstrating tolerance to salt spray and wind. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
