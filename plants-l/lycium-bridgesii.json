It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some bird species, playing a role in seed dispersal. Lycium bridgesii thrives in coastal and inland regions, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
