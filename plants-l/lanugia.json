    "intro": "Lanugia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow. Lanugia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
