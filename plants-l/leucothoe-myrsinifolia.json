    "intro": "Leucothoe myrsinifolia, commonly known as silverleaf leucothoe, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
