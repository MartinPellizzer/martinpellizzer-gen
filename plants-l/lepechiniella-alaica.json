    "intro": "Lepechiniella alaica, commonly known as the Alaskan lepechiniella, is a small, mat-forming perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant has tiny, hairy leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, helping to conserve moisture in harsh climates. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Lepechiniella alaica is adapted to cold temperatures and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
