It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose heads. This form is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy flower heads compared to the typical variety. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
