    "intro": "Leontodon hyoseroides subsp. pseudocrispus, commonly known as the curled hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in the summer. Its inflorescence consists of tightly packed, yellowish-green florets that are often mistaken for dandelion flowers. The species is characterized by its distinctive, curled bracts that give it its common name."
