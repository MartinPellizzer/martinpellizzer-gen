    "intro": "Lobivia atrovirens var. pseudoritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's Lobivia, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dark green, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by pale green, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
