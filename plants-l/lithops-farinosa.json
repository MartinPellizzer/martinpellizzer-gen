    "intro": "Lithops farinosa, commonly known as the \"pea leaf\" lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often segmented leaves that resemble stones, aiding in its camouflage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. Lithops farinosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
