    "intro": "Laricorchis aggregata, commonly known as the clustered tassel orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance."
