    "intro": "Lycopodium lucidulum var. verum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a relic of early plant evolution."
