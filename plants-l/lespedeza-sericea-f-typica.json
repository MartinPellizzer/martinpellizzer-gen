    "intro": "Lespedeza sericea f. typica, commonly known as silky lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, slender stems and small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
