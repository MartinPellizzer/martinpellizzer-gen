    "intro": "Luzula saltuensis, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes true grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Luzula saltuensis produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky or mountainous environments."
