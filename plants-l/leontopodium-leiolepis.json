    "intro": "Leontopodium leiolepis, commonly known as the alpine edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white, silky hairs that protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in similar silky hairs. It is often found in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cold, sunny environments."
