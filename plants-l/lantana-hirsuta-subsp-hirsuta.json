    "intro": "Lantana hirsuta subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lantana, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence and specific floral morphology compared to other lantana species."
