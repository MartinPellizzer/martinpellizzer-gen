    "intro": "Loranthus oleifolius var. forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees such as eucalypts and acacias. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating bird-mediated dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees thrive."
