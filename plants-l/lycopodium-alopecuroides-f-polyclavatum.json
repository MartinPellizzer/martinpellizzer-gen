    "intro": "Lycopodium alopecuroides f. polyclavatum, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a rare fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
