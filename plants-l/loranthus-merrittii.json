    "intro": "Loranthus merrittii, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus merrittii is native to regions of India and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
