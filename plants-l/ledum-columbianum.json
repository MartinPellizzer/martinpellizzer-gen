    "intro": "Ledum columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia rosebay, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
