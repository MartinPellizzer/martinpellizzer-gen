    "intro": "Lomaria densa, commonly known as the dense lomaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Lomaria densa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
