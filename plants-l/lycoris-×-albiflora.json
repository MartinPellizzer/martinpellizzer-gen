    "intro": "Lycoris \u00d7 albiflora, commonly known as the white lily-of-the-valley, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Lycoris radiata and Lycoris chinensis. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and ability to naturalize over time."
