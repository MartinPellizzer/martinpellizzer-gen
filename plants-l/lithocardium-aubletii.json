    "intro": "Lithocardium aubletii, commonly known as the purple-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces striking violet or purple flowers during the dry season. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Lithocardium aubletii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
