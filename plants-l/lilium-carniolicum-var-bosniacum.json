    "intro": "Lilium carniolicum var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive red-brown pattern on the tepals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous underground storage organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
