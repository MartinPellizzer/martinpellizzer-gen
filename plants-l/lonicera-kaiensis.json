    "intro": "Lonicera kaiensis, commonly known as the Kai Islands honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific, specifically the islands of the Cook Islands and French Polynesia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with five petals and a tubular corolla. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Lonicera kaiensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in sunny, well-drained habitats."
