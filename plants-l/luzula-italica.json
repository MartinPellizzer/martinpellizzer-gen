    "intro": "Luzula italica, commonly known as Italian woodrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems. Luzula italica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats."
