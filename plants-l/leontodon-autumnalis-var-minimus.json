    "intro": "Leontodon autumnalis var. minimus, commonly known as the autumn leontodon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the fall, and it produces achenes as its seeds. The variety *minimus* is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of *Leontodon autumnalis*."
