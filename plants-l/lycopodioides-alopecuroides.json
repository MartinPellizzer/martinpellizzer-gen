    "intro": "Lycopodioides alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping growth habit. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant produces sporophytes with distinct strobila structures that bear spores, a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are often densely packed and covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lycopodioides alopecuroides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
