    "intro": "Leptochloa perennis, commonly known as perennial grass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats or tufts, often found in moist or wetland environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green in color. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Leptochloa perennis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
