    "intro": "Lepanthes gibberosa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which resemble a slipper or a lady's shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually dark green and elliptical, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Lepanthes gibberosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
