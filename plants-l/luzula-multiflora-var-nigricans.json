It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale blue flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of moist forest understories."
