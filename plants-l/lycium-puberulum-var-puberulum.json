    "intro": "Lycium puberulum var. puberulum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant has woody stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to harsh conditions, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
