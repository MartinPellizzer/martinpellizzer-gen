    "intro": "Lonicera hypoglauca subsp. nudiflora, commonly known as the nakedflower honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated margin. The berries that follow the flowers are orange-red and edible, though not as widely consumed as those of other honeysuckle species."
