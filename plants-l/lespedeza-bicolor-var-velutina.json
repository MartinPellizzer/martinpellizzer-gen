    "intro": "Lespedeza bicolor var. velutina, commonly known as velvet lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland ecosystems."
