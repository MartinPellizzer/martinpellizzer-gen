It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It produces distinctive, horn-shaped fruits that are covered in a rough, waxy coating. Lepidium ceratocarpum is often found in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to thrive in cool, moist conditions."
