    "intro": "Limniris, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Nymphaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and yellow. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies, while the leaves and flowers float on the surface. Limniris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
