    "intro": "Lycium chilense var. deserticum, commonly known as the Chilean wolfberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, red, berry-like fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, saline soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and star-shaped, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
