    "intro": "Lotus tenellus, commonly known as the slender lotus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of Africa and parts of Asia. It features striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom on tall, slender stems above its heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
