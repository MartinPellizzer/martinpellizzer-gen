    "intro": "Lingnania funghomii, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lingnania funghomii is considered an endangered species."
