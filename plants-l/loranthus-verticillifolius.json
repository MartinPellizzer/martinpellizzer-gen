It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, opposite, and often clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
