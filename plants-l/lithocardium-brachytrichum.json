    "intro": "Lithocardium brachytrichum, commonly known as the short-hair stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in short, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted for storing water and surviving in low-nutrient soils. Lithocardium brachytrichum is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry, sunny habitats."
