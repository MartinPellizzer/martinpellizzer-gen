    "intro": "Loranthus tawaensis, commonly known as the Tawa mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees, primarily rimu and tawa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own nutrients through photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in the New Zealand ecosystem, despite its parasitic nature."
