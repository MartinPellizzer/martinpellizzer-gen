    "intro": "Leucheria eriochlaena, commonly known as the white-flowered leucheria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
