    "intro": "Lathyrus laevigatus subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
