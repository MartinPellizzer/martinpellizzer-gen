    "intro": "Leptochilus hydrophyllus, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, green flowers appear in clusters and are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The roots of Leptochilus hydrophyllus help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
