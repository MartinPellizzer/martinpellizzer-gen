    "intro": "Linaria genistifolia subsp. genistifolia, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common toadflax. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
