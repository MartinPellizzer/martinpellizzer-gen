    "intro": "Lysimachia grisea, commonly known as gray willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has thin, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Lysimachia grisea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
