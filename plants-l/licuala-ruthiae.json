    "intro": "Licuala ruthiae, commonly known as the golden palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of pale yellow to golden spines. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The inflorescence consists of a tall, branched cluster of small, white flowers that eventually give way to dark blue berries."
