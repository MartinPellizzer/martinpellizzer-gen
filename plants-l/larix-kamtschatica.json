    "intro": "Larix kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its deciduous needles, which turn golden before falling off in autumn. The tree produces small, woody cones that release seeds in the spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This hardy species is often found in boreal forests and is valued for its timber and ecological role."
