    "intro": "Lycopodium novae-hollandiae, commonly known as the New Holland clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils or among leaf litter. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
