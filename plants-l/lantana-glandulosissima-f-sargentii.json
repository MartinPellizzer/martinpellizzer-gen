    "intro": "Lantana glandulosissima f. sargentii, commonly known as Sargent's lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and along streambanks."
