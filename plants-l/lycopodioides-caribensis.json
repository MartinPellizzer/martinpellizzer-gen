    "intro": "Lycopodioides caribensis, commonly known as the Caribbean clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Lycopodioides caribensis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its structure and reproductive features are typical of ancient vascular plants, reflecting its evolutionary history."
