It is characterized by its silvery-blue flowers and finely hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus sericeus var. kuschei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
