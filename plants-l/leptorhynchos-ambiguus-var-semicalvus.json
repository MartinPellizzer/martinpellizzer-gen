    "intro": "Leptorhynchos ambiguus var. semicalvus, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairiness compared to the typical form of the species."
