    "intro": "Lupinus lenorensis, commonly known as the Lenore's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus lenorensis is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It plays an important role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
