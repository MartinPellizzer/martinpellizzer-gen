It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
