    "intro": "Lepanthes variabilis, commonly known as the Variable Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Lepanthes variabilis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
