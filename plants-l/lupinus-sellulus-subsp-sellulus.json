It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
