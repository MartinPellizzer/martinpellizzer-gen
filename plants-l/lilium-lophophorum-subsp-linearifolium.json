    "intro": "Lilium lophophorum subsp. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved fawn lily, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh alpine conditions, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
