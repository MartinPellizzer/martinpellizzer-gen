    "intro": "Lotodes cephalanthum, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with a yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize shallow water areas. The yellow water lily plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
