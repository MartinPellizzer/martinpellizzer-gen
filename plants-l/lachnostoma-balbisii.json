    "intro": "Lachnostoma balbisii, commonly known as the Balbisii lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on calcareous substrates. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is considered a good indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
