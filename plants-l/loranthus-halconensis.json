    "intro": "Loranthus halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecological interactions within its habitat."
