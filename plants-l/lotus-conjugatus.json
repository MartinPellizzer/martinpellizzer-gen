    "intro": "Lotus conjugatus, commonly known as the yellow lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Lotus conjugatus is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
