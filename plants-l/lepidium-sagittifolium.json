    "intro": "Lepidium sagittifolium, commonly known as the arrowleaf peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are arrow-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
