    "intro": "Lepanthes volador, commonly known as the flying orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique, butterfly-like appearance, which is why it is also called the flying orchid. Its flowers typically bloom in the spring and are characterized by their pale purple or white coloration. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Lepanthes volador is considered a threatened species in many regions."
