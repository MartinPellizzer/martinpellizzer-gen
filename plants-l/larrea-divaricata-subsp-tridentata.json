    "intro": "Larrea divaricata subsp. tridentata, commonly known as creosote bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, with adaptations such as waxy leaves and deep root systems that allow it to thrive in harsh desert environments. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Larrea divaricata subsp. tridentata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
