    "intro": "Lycopodiella caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Lycopodiella caroliniana is often found in the southeastern United States and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
