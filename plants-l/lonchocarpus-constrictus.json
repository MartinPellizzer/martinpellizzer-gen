    "intro": "Lonchocarpus constrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf senna, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility."
