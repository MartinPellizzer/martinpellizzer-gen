It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically dark green to black in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
