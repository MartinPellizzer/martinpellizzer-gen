    "intro": "Lathraea squamaria subsp. squamaria, commonly known as the moss-like broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, instead having a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like structure. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited visibility, it is sometimes overlooked in ecological studies."
