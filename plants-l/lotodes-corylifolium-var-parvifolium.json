    "intro": "Lotodes corylifolium var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This variety is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
