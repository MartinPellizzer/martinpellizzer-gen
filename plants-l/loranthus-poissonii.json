    "intro": "Loranthus poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson\u2019s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects, which aid in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful."
