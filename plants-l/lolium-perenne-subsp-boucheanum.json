    "intro": "Lolium perenne subsp. boucheanum, commonly known as the Bouchean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually terminal and sometimes lateral. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in landscaping or as a turfgrass in specific climates."
