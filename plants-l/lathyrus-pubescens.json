It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Lathyrus pubescens is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
