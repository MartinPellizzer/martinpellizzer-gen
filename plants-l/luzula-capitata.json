    "intro": "Luzula capitata, commonly known as the tufted wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves that form a compact rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Luzula capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
