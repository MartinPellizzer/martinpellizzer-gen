    "intro": "Linum catharticum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
