It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
