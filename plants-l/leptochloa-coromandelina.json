    "intro": "Leptochloa coromandelina, commonly known as slender grass or Indian rice grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and 2\u20135 mm wide, with a smooth, grassy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Leptochloa coromandelina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
