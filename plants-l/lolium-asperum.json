    "intro": "Lolium asperum, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The leaves are narrow and rough to the touch, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Lolium asperum is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Lolium species, contributing to its ecological and agricultural significance."
