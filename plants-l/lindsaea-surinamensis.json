    "intro": "Lindsaea surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Lindsaea surinamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
