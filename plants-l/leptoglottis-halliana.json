    "intro": "Leptoglottis halliana, commonly known as the Hall's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
