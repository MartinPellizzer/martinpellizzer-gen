    "intro": "Lonicera spinosa, commonly known as the bristly honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are red and toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds. Lonicera spinosa is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
