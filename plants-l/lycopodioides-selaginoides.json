    "intro": "Lycopodioides selaginoides, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often scale-like and can be found in dense mats, forming a low-growing structure. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
