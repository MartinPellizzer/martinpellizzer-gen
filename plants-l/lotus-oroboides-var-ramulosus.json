    "intro": "Lotus oroboides var. ramulosus, commonly known as the clustered lotus, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive spurred petal. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The clustered lotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
