    "intro": "Larix japonica, commonly known as Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its ability to shed its needle-like leaves in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous species. Its foliage is often a striking golden yellow in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. The bark of Larix japonica is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
