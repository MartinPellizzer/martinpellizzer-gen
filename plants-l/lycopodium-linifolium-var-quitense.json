    "intro": "Lycopodium linifolium var. quitense, commonly known as the Andean clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
