    "intro": "Lycopodium selaginoides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium selaginoides thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
