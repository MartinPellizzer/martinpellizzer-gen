    "intro": "Lagopsis eriostachya, commonly known as the soft bursage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, woolly leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Lagopsis eriostachya is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
