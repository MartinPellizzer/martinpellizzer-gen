    "intro": "Linaria dumanii, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Linaria dumanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
