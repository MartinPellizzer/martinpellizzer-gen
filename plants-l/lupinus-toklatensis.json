    "intro": "Lupinus toklatensis, commonly known as Toklat lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus toklatensis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
