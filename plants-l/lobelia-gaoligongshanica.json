    "intro": "Lobelia gaoligongshanica, commonly known as the Gaoligongshan lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
