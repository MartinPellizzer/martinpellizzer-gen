    "intro": "Lycium mediterraneum subsp. longiflorum, commonly known as the Mediterranean boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, spiny stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
