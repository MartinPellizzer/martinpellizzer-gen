    "intro": "Lisianthius elatus, commonly known as the skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that can reach up to two meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
