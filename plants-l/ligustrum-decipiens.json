    "intro": "Ligustrum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive privet, is a species of flowering plant in the Oleaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Ligustrum decipiens is often used as an ornamental plant due to its adaptability and ease of cultivation."
