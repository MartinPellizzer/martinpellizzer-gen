    "intro": "Lactuca rariflora, commonly known as the rare lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Lactuca rariflora is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
