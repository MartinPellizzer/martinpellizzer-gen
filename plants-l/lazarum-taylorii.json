    "intro": "Lazarum taylorii, commonly known as Taylor's lazarus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
