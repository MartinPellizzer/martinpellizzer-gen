    "intro": "Leucanthemum lacustre, commonly known as the water thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it is often found in clusters. Leucanthemum lacustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
