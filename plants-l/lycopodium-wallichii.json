    "intro": "Lycopodium wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Lycopodium wallichii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its historical use in traditional medicine highlights its significance in both ecological and cultural contexts."
