    "intro": "Lilium penduliflorum, commonly known as the hanging-flower lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that hang from long, slender stems, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with a yellow anther. Lilium penduliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
