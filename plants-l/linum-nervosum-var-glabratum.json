    "intro": "Linum nervosum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth flax or glabrous flax, is a variant of the flax plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabratum' variety is less hairy than the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
