    "intro": "Lavandula minutolii var. minutolii, commonly known as the dwarf lavender, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, fragrant purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its smaller stature compared to other lavender species, typically reaching only a few inches in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its unique appearance and aromatic qualities, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
