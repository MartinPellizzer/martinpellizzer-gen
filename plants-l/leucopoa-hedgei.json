    "intro": "Leucopoa hedgei, commonly known as the Hedge's leucopoa, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in shaded areas and thrives in humid climates. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
