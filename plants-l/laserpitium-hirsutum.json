    "intro": "Laserpitium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy lasur or hairy grass of the mountains, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, yellowish to brownish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves provides insulation against the harsh mountain climate."
