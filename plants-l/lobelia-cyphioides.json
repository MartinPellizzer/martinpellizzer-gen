    "intro": "Lobelia cyphioides, commonly known as the Cape York lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Lobelia cyphioides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and birds."
