    "intro": "Lipocarpha senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese marsh grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas in West Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in these sensitive habitats."
