    "intro": "Leea parva, commonly known as the small leea or dwarf leea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet and features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for garden landscapes. Leea parva is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates."
