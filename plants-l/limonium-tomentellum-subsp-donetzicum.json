    "intro": "Limonium tomentellum subsp. donetzicum, commonly known as the Donetz cushionflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically forms compact cushions or mats, which help it survive in dry, open habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in sandy or loamy conditions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy member of the Plumbagaceae family."
