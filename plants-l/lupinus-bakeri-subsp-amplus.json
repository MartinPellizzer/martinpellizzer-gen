It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen enrichment."
