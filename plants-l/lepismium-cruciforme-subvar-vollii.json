    "intro": "Lepismium cruciforme subvar. vollii, commonly known as the Vollii's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white flowers that resemble translucent petals, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, slender leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
