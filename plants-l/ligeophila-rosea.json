    "intro": "Ligeophila rosea, commonly known as the rose-like aquatic plant, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often displaying a pink or reddish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged, adapted to its aquatic environment. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can spread through rhizomes. Ligeophila rosea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
