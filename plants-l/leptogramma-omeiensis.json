    "intro": "Leptogramma omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leptogramma omeiensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
