    "intro": "Lathyrus palustris f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy marsh vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its \"hairy\" designation. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, with each leaflet having a slightly serrated edge. This variety is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds."
