    "intro": "Leiophyllum buxifolium var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate boxleaf shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green color, often with a slight blue or grayish hue. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly valued for its compact form and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for seaside landscapes."
