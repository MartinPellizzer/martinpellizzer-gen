    "intro": "Lomatia ilicifolia var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lomatia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are typically followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal climates, making it a hardy and resilient species."
