    "intro": "Linaria heterophylla var. pseudosupina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens despite being considered invasive in some regions."
