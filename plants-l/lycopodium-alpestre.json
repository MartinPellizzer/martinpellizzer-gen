    "intro": "Lycopodium alpestre, commonly known as the alpine clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Lycopodium alpestre is adapted to grow in rocky, alpine environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
