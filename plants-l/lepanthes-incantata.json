    "intro": "Lepanthes incantata, commonly known as the enchanted orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a striking combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Lepanthes incantata is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
