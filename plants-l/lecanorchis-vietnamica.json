    "intro": "Lecanorchis vietnamica, commonly known as the Vietnamese twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific tree species. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a lip that is slightly differentiated. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lecanorchis vietnamica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
