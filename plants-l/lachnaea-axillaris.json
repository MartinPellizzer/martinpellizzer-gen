    "intro": "Lachnaea axillaris, commonly known as the axillary lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique botanical structure. It belongs to the family Lichenes, and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, typically found on bark or stone surfaces. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found in temperate regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
