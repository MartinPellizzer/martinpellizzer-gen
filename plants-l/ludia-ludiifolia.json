It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its ecological role within its native habitat. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
