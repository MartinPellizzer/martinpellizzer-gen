    "intro": "Lycopus coreanus var. ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy false geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
