It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or on tree trunks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. Liparis angkae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
