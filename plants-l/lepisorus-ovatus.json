    "intro": "Lepisorus ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant produces small, ovate-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Lepisorus ovatus typically grows in temperate regions, often on cliffs or in woodland areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
