    "intro": "Lepidium raimondii, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Lepidium raimondii has a rosette growth form, with leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
