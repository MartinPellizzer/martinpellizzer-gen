    "intro": "Lipocarpha constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats in shallow water or muddy soils. Lipocarpha constricta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
