    "intro": "Lolium speciosum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
