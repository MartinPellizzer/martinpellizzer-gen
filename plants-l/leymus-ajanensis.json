    "intro": "Leymus ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust root system and tufted growth habit, which allow it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to reduce water loss in dry climates. Leymus ajanensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
