    "intro": "Lepidium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round, seed-like fruits called siliques. Lepidium cordatum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
