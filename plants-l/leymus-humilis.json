    "intro": "Leymus humilis, commonly known as the lowly grass or dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in tundra environments. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Leymus humilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
