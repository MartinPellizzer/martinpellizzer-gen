    "intro": "Lupinus platamodes, commonly known as the plains lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus platamodes plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil for other plants."
