    "intro": "Liparis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Liparis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
