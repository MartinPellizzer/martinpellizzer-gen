    "intro": "Lachnopylis guineensis, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to humans and livestock, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Lachnopylis guineensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
