    "intro": "Lythrum semiamplexans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rosemary or red root, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Lythraceae family, which includes other plants like the poinsettia and the flowering maple. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly clasping near the base. Its showy, clustered pink to red flowers appear in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
