    "intro": "Leuconymphaea ampla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy substrates while absorbing nutrients from the water. Leuconymphaea ampla plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
