    "intro": "Loranthus meridianus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some organic compounds in return. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and spherical, fleshy fruits that contain sticky seeds. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of parasitic plants."
