    "intro": "Lactuca pseudosonchus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiny stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Lactuca pseudosonchus is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
