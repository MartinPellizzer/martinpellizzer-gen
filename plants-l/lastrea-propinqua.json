    "intro": "Lastrea propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf rock fig, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
