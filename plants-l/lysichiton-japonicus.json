    "intro": "Lysichiton japonicus, commonly known as Japanese swamp lantern, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, showy spatheous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments and has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often mottled with white or yellow markings. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a landscape plant."
