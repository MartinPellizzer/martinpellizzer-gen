    "intro": "Lepidium chalepense, commonly known as wild cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a peppery aroma. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
