    "intro": "Lastrea pulvinulifera var. zeylanica, commonly known as the Zeylanica lastrea, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens."
