    "intro": "Lecanopteris scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to climb or trail along surfaces. It features pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, often serrated or toothed margin. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary among different populations. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
