    "intro": "Limnophila dasyantha, commonly known as the hairy water plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is typically found in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow waters. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. Its small, green leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Limnophila dasyantha produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
