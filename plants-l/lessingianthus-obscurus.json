    "intro": "Lessingianthus obscurus, commonly known as the dark lessingia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a rounded inflorescence, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
