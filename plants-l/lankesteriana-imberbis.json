    "intro": "Lankesteriana imberbis, commonly known as the hairless lankesteriana, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and large, showy flowers with a distinctive white and green coloration. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
