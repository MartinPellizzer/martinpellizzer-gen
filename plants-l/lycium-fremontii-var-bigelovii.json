It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters. This species plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
