    "intro": "Lonicera periclymenum var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red, appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The hairy honeysuckle is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
