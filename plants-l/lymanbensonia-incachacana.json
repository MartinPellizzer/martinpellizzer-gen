    "intro": "Lymanbensonia incachacana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the poor, rocky soil in which it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
