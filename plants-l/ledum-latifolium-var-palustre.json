    "intro": "Ledum latifolium var. palustre, commonly known as broadleaf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a waxy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are dark red to black, containing a single seed, and are often consumed by wildlife. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in bogs and swamps."
