    "intro": "Leptolepidium subvillosum var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its alpine habitat. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to extreme altitudes and arid climates."
