    "intro": "Lepidium montanum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wallcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually hairless, giving it its subspecies name \"glabrum.\" Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
