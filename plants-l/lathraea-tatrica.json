    "intro": "Lathraea tatrica, commonly known as the Carpathian ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species such as Ericaceae. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with a rosette of fleshy, reddish leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears small, white flowers. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments. Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
