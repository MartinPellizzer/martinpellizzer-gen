    "intro": "Linaria glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, sometimes sticky texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange or red flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Linaria glandulifera is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
