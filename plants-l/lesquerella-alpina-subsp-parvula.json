    "intro": "Lesquerella alpina subsp. parvula, commonly known as the alpine lesquerella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces seeds encased in a unique, waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
