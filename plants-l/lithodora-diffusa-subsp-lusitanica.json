It features small, dark blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in woodland edges and mountainous regions, where it forms dense mats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
