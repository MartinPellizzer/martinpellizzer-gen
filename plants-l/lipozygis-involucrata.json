    "intro": "Lipozygis involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
