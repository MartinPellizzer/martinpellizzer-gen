    "intro": "Loranthus havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. This species is often found in forested areas of the southeastern United States."
