    "intro": "Ludwigia peploides subsp. peploides, commonly known as the velvetleaf water primrose, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered with a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from summer to autumn. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
