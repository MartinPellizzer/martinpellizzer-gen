    "intro": "Lepanthes reticulata, commonly known as the netted slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, netted-patterned petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that attracts pollinators. Lepanthes reticulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
