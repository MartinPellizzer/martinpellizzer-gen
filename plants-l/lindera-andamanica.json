    "intro": "Lindera andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands. It features smooth, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Lindera andamanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
