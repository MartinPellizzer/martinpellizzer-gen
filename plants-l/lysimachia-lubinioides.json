    "intro": "Lysimachia lubinioides, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a decorative garden plant and an effective ground cover."
