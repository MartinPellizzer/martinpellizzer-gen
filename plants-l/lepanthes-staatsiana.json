It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Lepanthes staatsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
