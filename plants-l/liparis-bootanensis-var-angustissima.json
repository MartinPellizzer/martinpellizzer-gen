    "intro": "Liparis bootanensis var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are borne on lateral spikes and are often clustered in small groups, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. This variety is noted for its refined appearance and is a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
