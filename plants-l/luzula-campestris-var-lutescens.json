    "intro": "Luzula campestris var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow woodrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, berry-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its yellowish hue, which sets it apart from the more common green varieties of Luzula."
