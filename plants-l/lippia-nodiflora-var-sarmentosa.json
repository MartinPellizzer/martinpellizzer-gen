It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a fragrant aroma when crushed. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its aromatic properties."
