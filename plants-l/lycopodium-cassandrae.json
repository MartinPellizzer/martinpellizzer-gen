    "intro": "Lycopodium cassandrae, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems that produce clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spore-producing organs. Lycopodium cassandrae thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories in sub-Saharan Africa. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
