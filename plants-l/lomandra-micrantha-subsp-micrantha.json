    "intro": "Lomandra micrantha subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in dense, grass-like clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-white flowers, which are often concealed by the foliage. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
