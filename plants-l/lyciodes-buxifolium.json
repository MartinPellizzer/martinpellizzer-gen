    "intro": "Lyciodes buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaved lyciodes, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
