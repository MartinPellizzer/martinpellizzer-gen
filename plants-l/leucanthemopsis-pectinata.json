    "intro": "Leucanthemopsis pectinata, commonly known as the white marguerite, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
