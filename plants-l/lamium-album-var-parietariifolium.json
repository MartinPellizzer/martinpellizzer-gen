    "intro": "Lamium album var. parietariifolium, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, white, and arranged in whorls along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It is characterized by its lack of stinging hairs, distinguishing it from other members of the nettle family. Its botanical name reflects its pale color and leaf shape, which resemble those of the common dead-nettle."
