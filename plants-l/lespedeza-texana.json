    "intro": "Lespedeza texana, commonly known as Texas lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces fluffy, grayish seedpods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Texas lespedeza is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
