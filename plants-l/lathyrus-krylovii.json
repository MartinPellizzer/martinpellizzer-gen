    "intro": "Lathyrus krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pods contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Lathyrus krylovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
