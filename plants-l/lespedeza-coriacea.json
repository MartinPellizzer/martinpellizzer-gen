    "intro": "Lespedeza coriacea, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant produces small, delicate pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is narrow and gray-green, giving it a distinctive, drought-tolerant appearance. Lespedeza coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
