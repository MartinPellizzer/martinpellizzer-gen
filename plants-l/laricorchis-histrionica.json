    "intro": "Laricorchis histrionica, commonly known as the showy lady's-tongue, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues, which are highly ornamental. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, tongue-like lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
