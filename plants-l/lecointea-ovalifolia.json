    "intro": "Lecointea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf lecointea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
