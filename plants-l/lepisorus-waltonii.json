    "intro": "Lepisorus waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in crevices in woodland areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Lepisorus waltonii is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
