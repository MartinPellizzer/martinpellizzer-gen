    "intro": "Lomandra purpurea, commonly known as the purple lomandra, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a rosette. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Lomandra purpurea is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
