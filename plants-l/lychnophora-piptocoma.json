It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which has been historically valued for its use in musical instruments and furniture. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. The species is also known for its ecological importance and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
