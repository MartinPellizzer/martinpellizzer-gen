    "intro": "Leiothrix flavescens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth golden leiothrix, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
