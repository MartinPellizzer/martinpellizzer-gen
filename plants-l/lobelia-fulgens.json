    "intro": "Lobelia fulgens, commonly known as the fireplant, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and swamps, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Lobelia fulgens is not only ornamental but also attracts pollinators like hummingbirds and bees due to its nectar-rich flowers."
