    "intro": "Lycopodium revolutum, commonly known as the rolling fern, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophytic structures are clustered at the base, and it produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Lycopodium revolutum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
