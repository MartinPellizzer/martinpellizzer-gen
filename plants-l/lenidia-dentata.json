    "intro": "Lenidia dentata, commonly known as the toothed lenidia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Lenidia dentata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
