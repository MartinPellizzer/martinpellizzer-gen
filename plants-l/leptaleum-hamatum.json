    "intro": "Leptaleum hamatum, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic, yellow-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
