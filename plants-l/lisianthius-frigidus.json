    "intro": "Lisianthius frigidus, commonly known as the cold-flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Lisianthius frigidus is considered a vulnerable species."
