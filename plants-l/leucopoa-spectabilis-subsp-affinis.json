It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in desert botany."
