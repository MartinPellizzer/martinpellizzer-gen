    "intro": "Lupinus lutosus, commonly known as the swamp lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with several leaflets, and its root system includes nitrogen-fixing nodules. Lupinus lutosus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
