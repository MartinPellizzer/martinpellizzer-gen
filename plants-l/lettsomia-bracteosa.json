    "intro": "Lettsomia bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Lettsomia bracteosa is an herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of tropical flora."
