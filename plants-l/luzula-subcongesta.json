It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers. Luzula subcongesta is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in association with other sedges and ferns in moist, acidic soils."
