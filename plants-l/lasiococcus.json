    "intro": "Lasiococcus, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their dense, woolly foliage, which gives them their common name. They typically have small, elliptical leaves and produce bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white. Lasiococcus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
