    "intro": "Ludwigia octovalvis var. ligustrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Ludwigia, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright red or orange, depending on light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by elliptical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in moderate to high light and is often used in aquascaping for its vibrant coloration. This variant is closely related to Ludwigia octovalvis but is distinguished by its broader leaves and more intense coloration."
