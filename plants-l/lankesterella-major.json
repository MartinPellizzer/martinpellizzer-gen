    "intro": "Lankesterella major, commonly known as the giant sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aeolidiidae and is characterized by its large, soft body and vibrant coloration. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a complex anatomy that includes a radula for feeding on algae. Its reproductive system is unique, featuring both male and female reproductive organs, allowing for simultaneous hermaphroditism. Lankesterella major plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding and reproductive behaviors."
