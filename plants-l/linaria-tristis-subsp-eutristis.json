It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and a common sight in desert regions."
