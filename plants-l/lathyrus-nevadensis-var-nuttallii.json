    "intro": "Lathyrus nevadensis var. nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Nuttall's vetch is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in mountainous regions where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations."
