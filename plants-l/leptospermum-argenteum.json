It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant produces small, woody fruits called capsules, which release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Leptospermum argenteum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping."
