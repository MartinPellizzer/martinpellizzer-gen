    "intro": "Lagenanthus, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical flower clusters that resemble bottle brushes, giving it its common name. The plants are native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. Lagenanthus species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
