    "intro": "Lomaria lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree or caucho, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which have been historically used for rubber production. Its roots and bark contain compounds with medicinal properties, used traditionally by indigenous communities. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in its natural range."
