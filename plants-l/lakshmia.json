    "intro": "Lakshmia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a species of water lily native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks emerging from the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic life. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a subtle fragrance, and they open during the early morning. Lakshmia plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism in Hindu traditions."
