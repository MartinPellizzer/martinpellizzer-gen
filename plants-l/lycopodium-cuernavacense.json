    "intro": "Lycopodium cuernavacense, commonly known as the Cuernavaca clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Morelos, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, creeping stem that produces small, scale-like leaves and erect, cone-like strobila that bear spores. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
