It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. This plant is of interest for its potential in biochemistry due to the presence of unique fatty acids in its seeds."
