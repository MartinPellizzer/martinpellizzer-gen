    "intro": "Lomatium macrocarpum var. artemisiarum, commonly known as the Townsend's lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its roots are fibrous and can become quite extensive, helping it to anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. This variety is closely related to other lomatium species and is often found in association with other native flora in its ecological community."
