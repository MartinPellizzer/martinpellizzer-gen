    "intro": "Lepisorus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored fronds, with the upper surface typically green and the lower surface often a lighter green or yellowish-white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky substrates. Lepisorus bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
