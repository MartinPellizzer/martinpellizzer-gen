It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, red-orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
