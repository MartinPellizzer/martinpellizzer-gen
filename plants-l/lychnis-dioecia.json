    "intro": "Lychnis dioecia, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a flowering plant in the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has opposite, linear leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals. It is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Lychnis dioecia is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
