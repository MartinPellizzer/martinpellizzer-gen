    "intro": "Lobivia maximiliana var. miniatiflora, commonly known as the miniature flowered lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a grey-green coloration, often adorned with sparse, spiny ribs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
