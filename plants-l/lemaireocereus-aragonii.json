    "intro": "Lemaireocereus aragonii, commonly known as the Aragon's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
