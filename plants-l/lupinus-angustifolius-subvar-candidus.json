    "intro": "Lupinus angustifolius subvar. candidus, commonly known as the white narrow-leafed lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
