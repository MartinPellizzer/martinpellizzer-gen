    "intro": "Lilium philadelphicum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the showy mountain-lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, erect stem bearing a single flower. The showy mountain-lily is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
