    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum var. chaminadeanum, commonly known as the Chaminade's clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters on the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically reddish-brown and clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
