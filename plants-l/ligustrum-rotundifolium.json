    "intro": "Ligustrum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability to various soil types. Ligustrum rotundifolium is also used in landscaping for its ability to tolerate pruning and its tolerance to urban environments."
