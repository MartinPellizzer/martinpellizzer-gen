    "intro": "Leontodon crispus subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile hawk's-beak, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a loose, branched inflorescence, and the plant is adapted to harsh, well-drained environments. It is of interest to botanists due to its ecological niche and distinctive morphology."
