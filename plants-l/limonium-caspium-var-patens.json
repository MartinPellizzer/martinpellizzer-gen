    "intro": "Limonium caspium var. patens, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism triggered by wind or touch. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Limonium caspium var. patens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
