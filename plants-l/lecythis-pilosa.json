    "intro": "Lecythis pilosa, commonly known as the \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a large tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into large, woody capsules containing up to 20 Brazil nuts. Its fruits are an important food source for various wildlife, including agoutis and rodents, which help disperse the seeds. The tree plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the Amazon and is also economically significant for its valuable nuts."
