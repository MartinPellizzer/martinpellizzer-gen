    "intro": "Lobelia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Lobelia pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
