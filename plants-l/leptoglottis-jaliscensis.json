It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
