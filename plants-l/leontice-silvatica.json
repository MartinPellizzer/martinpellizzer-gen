    "intro": "Leontice silvatica, commonly known as mountain leontice, is a perennial herb native to the forests of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
