It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of forests. The plant features delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a wide range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Lepanthes elata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
