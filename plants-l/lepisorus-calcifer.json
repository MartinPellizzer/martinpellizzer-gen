    "intro": "Lepisorus calcifer, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a low-growing mat, often growing on rocky substrates. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in calcium-rich environments, which is reflected in its common name. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, clustered sori on the underside. Lepisorus calcifer is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to shaded, moist conditions."
