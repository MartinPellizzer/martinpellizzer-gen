    "intro": "Ligusticum multifidum, commonly known as the fragrant cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a slender stem that is often hairy. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are aromatic, with a subtle anise-like scent, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
