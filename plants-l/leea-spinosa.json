    "intro": "Leea spinosa, commonly known as the spiny leea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Leeaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Leea spinosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
