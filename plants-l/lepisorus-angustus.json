    "intro": "Lepisorus angustus, commonly known as the narrow lepisorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and arching. This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, helping it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
