    "intro": "Lomaridium fragile, commonly known as the brittle lomaridium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features delicate, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. Due to its fragile structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
