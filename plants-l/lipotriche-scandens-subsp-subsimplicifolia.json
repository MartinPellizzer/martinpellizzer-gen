It features slender, twining stems that climb by means of small, hooked hairs. The leaves are simple, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and preference for well-drained, sandy soils."
