    "intro": "Lilium palibinianum, commonly known as the Palibinian lily, is a rare and unique species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to the cool and arid conditions of its natural habitat. It blooms during the late spring to early summer season, typically in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
