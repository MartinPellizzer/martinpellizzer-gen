It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Lechea cinerea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
