    "intro": "Lomatium ravenii, commonly known as Raven's lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the parsley family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds by wind. Lomatium ravenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
