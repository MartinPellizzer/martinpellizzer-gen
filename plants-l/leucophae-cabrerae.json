    "intro": "Leucophae cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Leucophae cabrerae is considered a critically endangered species."
