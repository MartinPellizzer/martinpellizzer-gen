    "intro": "Leucaena collinsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry systems due to its fast growth and drought tolerance."
