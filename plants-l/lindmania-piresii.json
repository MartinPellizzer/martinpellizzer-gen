    "intro": "Lindmania piresii, commonly known as the Pires' bromeliad, is a species native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the rainforest. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its moist but sometimes shaded habitat. The flowers, which are usually small and inconspicuous, emerge from the leaf axils and contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
