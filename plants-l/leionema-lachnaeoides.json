    "intro": "Leionema lachnaeoides, commonly known as the silver-leaved leionema, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in coastal and temperate regions."
