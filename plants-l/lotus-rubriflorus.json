    "intro": "Lotus rubriflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered lotus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a showy, pinkish-white center, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are adapted for water absorption. Lotus rubriflorus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in traditional practices."
