    "intro": "Lycium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy boxthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Lycium pubescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name and providing some protection against herbivores."
