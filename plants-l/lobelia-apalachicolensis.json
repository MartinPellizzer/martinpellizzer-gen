    "intro": "Lobelia apalachicolensis, commonly known as the Apalachicola lobelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and along stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Lobelia apalachicolensis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
