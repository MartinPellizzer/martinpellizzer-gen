    "intro": "Loranthus linifolius, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Loranthus, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus linifolius is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with specific host species such as citrus and mulberry trees."
