    "intro": "Leontodon hispidus subsp. bourgaeanus, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, preferring temperate climates. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, linear leaves and produces tall, branched flowering stems with showy yellow-orange flowers. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the Leontodon genus."
