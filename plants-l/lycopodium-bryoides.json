    "intro": "Lycopodium bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Lycopodium bryoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
