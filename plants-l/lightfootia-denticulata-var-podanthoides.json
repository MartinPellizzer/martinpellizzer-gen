    "intro": "Lightfootia denticulata var. podanthoides, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
