    "intro": "Lasthenia kunthii, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. The species is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
