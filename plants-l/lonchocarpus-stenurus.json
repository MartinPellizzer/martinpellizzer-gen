    "intro": "Lonchocarpus stenurus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senna, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitat."
