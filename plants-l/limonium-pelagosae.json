    "intro": "Limonium pelagosae, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and windy environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and striking color. Limonium pelagosae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
