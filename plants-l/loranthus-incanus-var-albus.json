    "intro": "Loranthus incanus var. albus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while also deriving some water and minerals through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive."
