    "intro": "Limosella africana, commonly known as African sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Limosella africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate appearance."
