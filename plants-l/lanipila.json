    "intro": "Lanipila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Unlike many orchids, Lanipila lacks a visible root system and instead relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its habitat is highly specialized, often growing on the surfaces of trees or in swampy areas with high humidity. Due to its rarity and specific environmental needs, Lanipila is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
