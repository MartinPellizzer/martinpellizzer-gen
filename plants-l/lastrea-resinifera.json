    "intro": "Lastrea resinifera, commonly known as the resinous lastrea, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its unique ability to exude a resin when wounded is a notable botanical feature. This adaptation helps protect the plant from herbivores and environmental stress."
