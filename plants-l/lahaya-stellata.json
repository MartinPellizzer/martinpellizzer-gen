    "intro": "Lahaya stellata, commonly known as the starleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties. Lahaya stellata has hairy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
