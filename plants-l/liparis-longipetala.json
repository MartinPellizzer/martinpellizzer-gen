    "intro": "Liparis longipetala, commonly known as the long-petioled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
