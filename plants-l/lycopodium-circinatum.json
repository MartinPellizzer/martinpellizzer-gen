    "intro": "Lycopodium circinatum, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium circinatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a horticultural specimen highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
