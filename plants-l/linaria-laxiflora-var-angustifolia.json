    "intro": "Linaria laxiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and bright yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, with branched stems and small, spurred petals. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
