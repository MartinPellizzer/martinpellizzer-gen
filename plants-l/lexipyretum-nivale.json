    "intro": "Lexipyretum nivale, commonly known as the snow feverfew, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
