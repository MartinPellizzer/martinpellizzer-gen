    "intro": "Limonia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny lime or sour orange, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny branches and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits that are typically sour but can be used in culinary applications. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a leathery texture. Limonia spinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
