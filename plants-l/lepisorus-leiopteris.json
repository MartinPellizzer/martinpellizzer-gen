It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle yellowish hue. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Lepisorus leiopteris is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
