    "intro": "Lathyrus magellanicus var. normalis, commonly known as the Magellanic pea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its natural spread. This species is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
