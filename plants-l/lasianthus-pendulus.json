    "intro": "Lasianthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging lasianthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its drooping inflorescences, which consist of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while the stems are slender and often vine-like. Lasianthus pendulus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive floral display and adaptability to shaded environments."
