    "intro": "Lathyrus aureus, commonly known as the golden pea or yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Lathyrus aureus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
