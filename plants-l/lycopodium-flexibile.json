    "intro": "Lycopodium flexibile, commonly known as the club moss, is a small, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves and a branching, upright stem that resembles a small tree. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium flexibile is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
