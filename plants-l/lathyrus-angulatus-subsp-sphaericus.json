    "intro": "Lathyrus angulatus subsp. sphaericus, commonly known as the spherical pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or nearly spherical seed pods, which set it apart from other members of the Lathyrus genus. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small, pale pink to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral and pod characteristics."
