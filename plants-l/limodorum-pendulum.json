    "intro": "Limodorum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean. It features delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical name reflects its drooping flower structure, which is a key characteristic of the genus Limodorum."
