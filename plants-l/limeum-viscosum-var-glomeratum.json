    "intro": "Limeum viscosum var. glomeratum, commonly known as sticky lime or sticky wallaby tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in glomerules, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
