    "intro": "Lespedeza cuneata var. serpens, commonly known as creeping lespedeza, is a low-growing perennial herb native to East Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across open ground. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by clusters of small, oblong seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils."
