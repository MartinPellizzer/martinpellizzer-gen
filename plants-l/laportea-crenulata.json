    "intro": "Laportea crenulata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Laportea crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
