    "intro": "Lespedeza intermedia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for erosion control in dry, open habitats. This variety is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
