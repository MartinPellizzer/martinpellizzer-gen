It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that range from yellow to red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soil. Lycaste pleiochroma is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
