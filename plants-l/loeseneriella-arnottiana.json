It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. It grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Loeseneriella arnottiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
