    "intro": "Lavandula officinalis proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lavender, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, aromatic leaves. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to lilac flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
