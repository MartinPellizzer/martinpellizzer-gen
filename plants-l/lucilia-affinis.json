    "intro": "Lucilia affinis, commonly known as the green bottle fly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is characterized by its metallic green body and distinctive appearance, often mistaken for other fly species. The plant aspect of Lucilia affinis refers to its role as a saprophagous organism, feeding on decaying organic matter rather than photosynthesizing. It plays a significant role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Due to its association with carrion, it is often used in forensic entomology to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations."
