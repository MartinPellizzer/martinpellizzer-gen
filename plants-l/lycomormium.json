    "intro": "Lycomormium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to various regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce yellow flowers that are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Lycomormium species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
