    "intro": "Lycianthes ciliolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with ciliate margins, giving it a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions, though it is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
