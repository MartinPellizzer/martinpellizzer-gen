    "intro": "Lophophora williamsii var. typica, commonly known as peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, globose stem covered in white, velvety hairs and produces yellow flowers during the spring. The plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous cultures. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its cultural and legal significance, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
