    "intro": "Laelia \u00d7 stetzneriana, commonly known as the Stetzner's laelia, is a hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Laelia purpurea and Laelia anceps. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in greenhouses and gardens around the world."
