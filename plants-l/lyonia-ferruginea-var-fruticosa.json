    "intro": "Lyonia ferruginea var. fruticosa, commonly known as the rusty lyonia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
