    "intro": "Lucuma zapota var. anguai, commonly known as the golden apple of the Andes, is a tropical tree native to the Peruvian highlands. It produces large, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp that resembles custard. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and the tree can live for several decades, making it a valuable crop for both local consumption and export."
