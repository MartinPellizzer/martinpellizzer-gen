    "intro": "Loranthus tristis, commonly known as the European mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are often red or yellow, contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of trees, facilitating propagation. Loranthus tristis plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
