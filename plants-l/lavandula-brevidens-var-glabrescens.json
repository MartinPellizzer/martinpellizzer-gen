    "intro": "Lavandula brevidens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth lavender, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, pale purple flowers during the summer months. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other lavender species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for both garden cultivation and aromatherapy purposes."
