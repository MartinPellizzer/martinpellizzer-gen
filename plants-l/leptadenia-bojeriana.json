    "intro": "Leptadenia bojeriana, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Leptadenia bojeriana is adapted to survive in dry conditions with its deep root system and ability to store water."
