    "intro": "Lepisorus normalis, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its fronds are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Lepisorus normalis is widely distributed across Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
