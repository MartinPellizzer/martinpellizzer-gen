It belongs to the family Anisophylleidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in a layer of mucus. The animal has a distinctive appearance with a long, thread-like tail and a body that is often pale in color.

Litobrochia setifera plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of organic material and serving as prey for various marine predators."
