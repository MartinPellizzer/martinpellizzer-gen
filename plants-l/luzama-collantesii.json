It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
