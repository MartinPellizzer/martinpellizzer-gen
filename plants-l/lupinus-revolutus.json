    "intro": "Lupinus revolutus, commonly known as the curly lupine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. Lupinus revolutus has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
