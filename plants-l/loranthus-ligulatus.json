    "intro": "Loranthus ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly the western United States. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
