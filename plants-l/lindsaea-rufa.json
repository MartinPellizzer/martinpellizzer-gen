    "intro": "Lindsaea rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
