    "intro": "Lindsaea tenera var. integra, commonly known as the slender lindsaea, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often hang from tree branches. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
