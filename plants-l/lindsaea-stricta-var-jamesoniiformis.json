    "intro": "Lindsaea stricta var. jamesoniiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lindsaea, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that grow in a rosette-like formation. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its fronds are delicate and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, with small, clustered sporangia on the undersides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
