    "intro": "Lappa \u00d7 scanica, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple underside. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it is considered an invasive species. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can cause severe skin irritation and is often avoided in natural areas."
