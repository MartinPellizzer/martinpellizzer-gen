    "intro": "Lepechinia sagittata, commonly known as arrowleaf lepechinia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble an arrowhead. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Lepechinia sagittata is an important plant for pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
