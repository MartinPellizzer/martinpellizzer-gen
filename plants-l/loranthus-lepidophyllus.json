    "intro": "Loranthus lepidophyllus, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Loranthaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is unique for its ability to survive extreme dehydration by curling into a compact, desiccated state, which allows it to remain dormant for long periods. When water becomes available, it \"resurrects\" by rapidly rehydrating and regaining its green, leafy appearance. Its botanical features include small, scale-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects."
