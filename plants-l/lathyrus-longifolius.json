It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Lathyrus longifolius is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
