    "intro": "Lindsaea digitata, commonly known as the fingered maidenhair fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble fingers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Lindsaea digitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
