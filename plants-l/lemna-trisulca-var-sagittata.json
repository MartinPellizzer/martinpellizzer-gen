    "intro": "Lemna trisulca var. sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its simple structure and rapid growth make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
