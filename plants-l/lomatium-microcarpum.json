    "intro": "Lomatium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like foliage and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its small, dry fruits are distinctive and contribute to its classification within the genus Lomatium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
