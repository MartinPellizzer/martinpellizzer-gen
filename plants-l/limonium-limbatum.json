    "intro": "Limonium limbatum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-blue, spiky flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Limonium limbatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
