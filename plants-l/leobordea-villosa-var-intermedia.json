    "intro": "Leobordea villosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly leobordea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and seasonal flowering display."
