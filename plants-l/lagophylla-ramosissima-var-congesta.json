    "intro": "Lagophylla ramosissima var. congesta, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to absorb water from deep within the soil, allowing it to thrive in saline and nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal and inland dunes."
