    "intro": "Leptocladodia microhelia f. microheliopsis, commonly known as the small-leaved form of the genus Leptocladodia, is a rare and specialized lichen species. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which consists of a closely packed, leaf-like cortex. The plant exhibits a pale to yellowish-green coloration, with a distinctive, finely wrinkled surface. It typically grows on bark and stone in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate to subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism."
