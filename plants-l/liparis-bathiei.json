    "intro": "Liparis bathiei, commonly known as the Bath's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
