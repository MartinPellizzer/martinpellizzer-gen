    "intro": "Lathyrus nigricans, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with pinnately compound leaves composed of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its seed pods are slender and contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Lathyrus nigricans is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
