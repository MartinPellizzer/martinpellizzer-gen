    "intro": "Ligularia hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf ligularia, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a glossy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
