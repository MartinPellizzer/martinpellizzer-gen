    "intro": "Lepeostegeres, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that often appear without leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, typically white or pale green, are highly specialized and adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Lepeostegeres is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
