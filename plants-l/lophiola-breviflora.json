    "intro": "Lophiola breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered lophiola, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain areas."
