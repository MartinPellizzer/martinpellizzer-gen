    "intro": "Ligustrum californicum, commonly known as California privet, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of California. It has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
