    "intro": "Lecanthus solandri, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
