    "intro": "Liparis lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or undergrowth. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive sepals and petals. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
