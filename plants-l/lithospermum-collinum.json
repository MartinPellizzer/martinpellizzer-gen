    "intro": "Lithospermum collinum, commonly known as the mountain lithosperm, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that often grow in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Lithospermum collinum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
