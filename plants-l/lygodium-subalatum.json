    "intro": "Lygodium subalatum, commonly known as the giant climbing fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique climbing habit, using its rhizomes to anchor itself to trees and other structures. Its spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Lygodium subalatum plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various animals."
