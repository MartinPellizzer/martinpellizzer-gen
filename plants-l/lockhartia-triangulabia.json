    "intro": "Lockhartia triangulabia, commonly known as the triangle orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a prominent lip, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
