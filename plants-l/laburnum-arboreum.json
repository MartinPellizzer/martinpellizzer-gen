It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
