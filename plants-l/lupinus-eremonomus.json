    "intro": "Lupinus eremonomus, commonly known as the desert lupine, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. Lupinus eremonomus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
