    "intro": "Lycopodioides involvens, commonly known as the curled clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in moist, shaded forest environments. Lycopodioides involvens is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils in woodland areas."
