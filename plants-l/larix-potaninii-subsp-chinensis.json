    "intro": "Larix potaninii subsp. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that turn golden yellow before falling in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds surrounded by a wing for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Chinese horticulture."
