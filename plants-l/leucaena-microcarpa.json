    "intro": "Leucaena microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. Leucaena microcarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a forage crop."
