It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat. It produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
