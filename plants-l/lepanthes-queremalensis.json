    "intro": "Lepanthes queremalensis, commonly known as the Queremal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its intricate floral structure includes a labellum that plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
