    "intro": "Linum quadrifolium, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has heart-shaped leaves that often have four lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The four-leaf clover is not only a symbol of good luck but also has historical uses in medicine and dye production."
