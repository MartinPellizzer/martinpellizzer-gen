    "intro": "Loranthus microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and health of its host trees. Its presence is often an indicator of mature, undisturbed forest habitats."
