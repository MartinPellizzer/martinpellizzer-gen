    "intro": "Lyonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky lyonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in woodland and swampy areas. The plant features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glandular surface that gives the plant its common name. Lyonia glandulosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
