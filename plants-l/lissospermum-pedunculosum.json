It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Lissospermum pedunculosum plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
