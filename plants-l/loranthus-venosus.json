    "intro": "Loranthus venosus, commonly known as the veiny mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, waxy leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of potential host trees. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and riverine forests."
