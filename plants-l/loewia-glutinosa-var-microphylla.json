It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, violet to blue flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its stems are hairy and often branching, with a tendency to sprawl along the ground. The fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, typical of the Solanaceae family."
