    "intro": "Luvunga borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean luvunga, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in the understory. Due to habitat loss, Luvunga borneensis is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
