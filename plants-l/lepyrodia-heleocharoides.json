    "intro": "Lepyrodia heleocharoides, commonly known as the water dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to waterlogged soils and high humidity."
