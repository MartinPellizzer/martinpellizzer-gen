    "intro": "Lotus kilimanjaricus, commonly known as the East African lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing a unique habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
