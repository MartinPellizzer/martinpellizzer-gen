    "intro": "Lepisorus neovenosus, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is typically found in temperate regions.
