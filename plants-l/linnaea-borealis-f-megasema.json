    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. megasema, commonly known as the giant twinflower, is a variant of the twinflower plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in pairs, distinguishing it from the typical smaller flowers of the species. The plant is a low-growing evergreen shrub with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This form is notable for its increased floral size and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits."
