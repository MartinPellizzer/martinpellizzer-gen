    "intro": "Liparis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking dichromatic flowers, which typically display contrasting colors on the dorsal and ventral petals. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually over time. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Liparis bicolor thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
