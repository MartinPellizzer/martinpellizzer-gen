    "intro": "Lasianthus filiformis var. bracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lasianthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are often borne on short, bract-like structures, which give the variety its name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
