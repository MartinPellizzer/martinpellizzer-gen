    "intro": "Lepanthes umbonata, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that feature a distinctive spur at the base of the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are usually broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Lepanthes umbonata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
