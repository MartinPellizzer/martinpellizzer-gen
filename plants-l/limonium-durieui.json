    "intro": "Limonium durieui, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium durieui is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
