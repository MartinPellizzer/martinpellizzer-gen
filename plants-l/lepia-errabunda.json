    "intro": "Lepia errabunda, commonly known as the wandering lepia, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in soft substrates, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged. Lepia errabunda plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
