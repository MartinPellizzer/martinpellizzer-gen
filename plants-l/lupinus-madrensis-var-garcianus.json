    "intro": "Lupinus madrensis var. garcianus, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a lupine, is a perennial legume native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with tall stems that bear clusters of spiny, pea-like flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
