    "intro": "Lupinus rainierensis, commonly known as Rainier lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Lupinus rainierensis plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
