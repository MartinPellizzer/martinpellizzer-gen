    "intro": "Lonicera inodora, commonly known as the fragrant honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds. Lonicera inodora is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
