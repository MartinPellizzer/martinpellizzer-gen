    "intro": "Lobivia pojoensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Pojoensis Lobivia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short stem with spines and produces striking, large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a desirable addition to xeriscaping and rock gardens."
