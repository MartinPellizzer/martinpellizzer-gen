    "intro": "Lychnophora bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *pau-rosa*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red or orange fruits containing one or two seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
