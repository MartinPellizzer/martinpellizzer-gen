    "intro": "Lingoum glaucinum, commonly known as the blue-green lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The plant's distinctive appearance is characterized by its bluish-green coloration, which results from the presence of the photosynthetic partner. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
