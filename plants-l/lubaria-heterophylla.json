    "intro": "Lubaria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lubaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to linear, depending on environmental conditions. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Lubaria heterophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
