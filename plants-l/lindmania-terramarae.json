    "intro": "Lindmania terramarae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian sword fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, sword-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed by water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
