    "intro": "Lecocarpus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the broadleaf sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in tidal zones where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are small, usually yellow or white, arranged in racemes. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release the seeds, which are often dispersed by water."
