It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. Luzula antarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
