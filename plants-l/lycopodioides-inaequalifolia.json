    "intro": "Lycopodioides inaequalifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the order Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia responsible for releasing spores. Lycopodioides inaequalifolia typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its simple, primitive morphology reflects its ancient lineage within the vascular plant group."
