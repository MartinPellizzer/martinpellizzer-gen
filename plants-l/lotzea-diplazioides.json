    "intro": "Lotzea diplazioides, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species in xerophytic habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its native desert environment."
