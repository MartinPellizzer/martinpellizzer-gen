    "intro": "Lactuca dentata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous prickly lettuce, is a variant of the prickly lettuce species. It is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features a rosette of serrated, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine spines. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The stolons, or runners, allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils."
