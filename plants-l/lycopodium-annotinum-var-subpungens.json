    "intro": "Lycopodium annotinum var. subpungens, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear, giving it a delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for studying ancient plant lineages and ecological succession."
