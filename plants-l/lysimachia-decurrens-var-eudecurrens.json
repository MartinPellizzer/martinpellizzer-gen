It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along moist soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in wet or boggy environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
