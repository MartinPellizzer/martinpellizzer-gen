    "intro": "Leptomischus wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species. Leptomischus wallichii plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
