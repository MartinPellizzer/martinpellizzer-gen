    "intro": "Lunathyrium vegetius var. liubaense, commonly known as the Liubaense Moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale lavender petals that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, making it a unique species in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
