    "intro": "Lecythis corrugata subsp. rosea, commonly known as the rosewood or red lecythis, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits that split open to reveal edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
