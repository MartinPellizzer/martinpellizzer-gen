    "intro": "Lauro-cerasus officinalis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry laurel, is a cultivar of the cherry laurel plant. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features a mix of white, green, and pink tones on its leaves. This plant is a hybrid between Prunus laurocerasus and Prunus cerasifera, resulting in a unique combination of traits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, leading to its distinctive appearance."
