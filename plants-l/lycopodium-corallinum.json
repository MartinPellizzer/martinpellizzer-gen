    "intro": "Lycopodium corallinum, commonly known as the coral clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and distinctive, coral-like appearance due to its branching structure. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Lycopodium corallinum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
