    "intro": "Lieutautia, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by narrow, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Lieutautia thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
