    "intro": "Lotus scoparius var. veatchii, commonly known as the Veatch's lotus, is a rare and distinctive aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are submerged, while its stems are typically erect and can reach several feet in height. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
