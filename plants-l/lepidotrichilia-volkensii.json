It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a peculiar growth habit, with its stems forming a compact, shrub-like structure. Its leaves are typically green and may have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking foliage."
