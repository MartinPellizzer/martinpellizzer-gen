    "intro": "Limeum echinatum, commonly known as the spiny lime, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often found in moist, tropical forest environments. Limeum echinatum is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential medicinal properties."
