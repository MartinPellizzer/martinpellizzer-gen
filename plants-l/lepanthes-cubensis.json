    "intro": "Lepanthes cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Cuba. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, Lepanthes cubensis is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
