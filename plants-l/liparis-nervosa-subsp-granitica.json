    "intro": "Liparis nervosa subsp. granitica, commonly known as the granitic lady's tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its clusters of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its range."
