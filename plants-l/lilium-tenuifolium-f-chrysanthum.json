    "intro": "Lilium tenuifolium f. chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden leaf lily, is a unique cultivar of the Asiatic lily species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often a striking golden-yellow color, distinguishing it from the typical green foliage of most lilies. The flowers are usually pink to red, with a trumpet-shaped form and a pleasant fragrance. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance."
