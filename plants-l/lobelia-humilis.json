    "intro": "Lobelia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf lobelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments, such as along stream banks and in woodland areas. Lobelia humilis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
