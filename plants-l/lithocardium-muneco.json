    "intro": "Lithocardium muneco, commonly known as the Muneco's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Lithocardium muneco is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
