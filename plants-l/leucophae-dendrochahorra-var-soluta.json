    "intro": "Leucophae dendrochahorra var. soluta, commonly known as the Solita Tree, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
