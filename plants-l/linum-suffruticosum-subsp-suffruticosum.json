    "intro": "Linum suffruticosum subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers with five petals, typical of the Linaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
