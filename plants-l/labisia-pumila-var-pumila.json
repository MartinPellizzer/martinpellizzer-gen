    "intro": "Labisia pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf plectranthus, is a low-growing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pale purple to blue in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This species is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its compact growth habit."
