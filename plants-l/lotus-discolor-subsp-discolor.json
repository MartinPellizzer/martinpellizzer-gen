    "intro": "Lotus discolor subsp. discolor, commonly known as the variable lotus, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
