    "intro": "Lotus stipularis, commonly known as the stipular lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes. Lotus stipularis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in some cultures."
