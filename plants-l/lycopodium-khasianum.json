It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Lycopodium khasianum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
