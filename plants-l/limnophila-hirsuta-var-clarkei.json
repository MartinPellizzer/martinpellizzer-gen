It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its hairy foliage and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Limnophila hirsuta."
