    "intro": "Lachnolepis moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus that is typically bright green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for forest health and biodiversity."
