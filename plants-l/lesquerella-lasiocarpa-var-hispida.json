    "intro": "Lesquerella lasiocarpa var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in erucic acid and have industrial applications. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The varietal form 'hispida' refers to the rough, hairy texture of its stems and leaves."
