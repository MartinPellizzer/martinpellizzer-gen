    "intro": "Landersia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Landersia species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, shaded environments. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom indoors. The genus includes several species, such as Landersia floribunda, which is known for its striking purple flowers."
