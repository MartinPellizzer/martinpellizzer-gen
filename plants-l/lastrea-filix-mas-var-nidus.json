It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is native to humid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, with a fibrous covering that helps retain moisture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, evergreen foliage.
