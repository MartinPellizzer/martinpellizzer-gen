    "intro": "Lycopodioides mollis, commonly known as the soft lycopod, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces sporophytes that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in temperate and tropical regions. Lycopodioides mollis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
