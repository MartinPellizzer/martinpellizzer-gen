It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch, hence its common name. Linaria glabrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
