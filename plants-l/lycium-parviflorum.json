It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has dense, spiny foliage, which provides shelter for small animals. Its berries are red or orange when mature and are edible for both humans and wildlife. Lycium parviflorum is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun."
