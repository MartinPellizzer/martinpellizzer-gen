    "intro": "Lawrencia berthae, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its endemic habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its restricted distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, Lawrencia berthae is considered an endangered species."
