    "intro": "Lotononis alpina subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the alpine lotononis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
