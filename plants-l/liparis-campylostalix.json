    "intro": "Liparis campylostalix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and bloom during the spring or early summer. Liparis campylostalix is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
