    "intro": "Lychnis fulgens f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth fireweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy in other forms of the species. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the stems, setting it apart from the more common hairy form of the species."
