It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Its leaves are often arranged in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. This species is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
