    "intro": "Linnaea borealis f. subconfluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twinflower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, white, bilaterally symmetric flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters of two. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a distinctive glandular margin. This variant is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form, which contributes to its unique botanical appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
