    "intro": "Lycium argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine boxthorn, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence, while its bark is rough and fissured. Lycium argentinum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
