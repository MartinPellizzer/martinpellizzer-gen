    "intro": "Laburnum vulgare f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping laburnum, is a striking ornamental shrub characterized by its cascading clusters of bright yellow, pendulous flowers. Native to Europe, it belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its showy, elongated inflorescences that dangle from the branches. The plant features pinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, contributing to its delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its toxicity, it should be planted with caution, especially in areas accessible to children and pets."
