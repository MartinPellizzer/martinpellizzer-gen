    "intro": "Lycopodium pectinatum, commonly known as the club moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a sporophyte that produces spores rather than seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is often thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its erect, branching stems. Lycopodium pectinatum plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
