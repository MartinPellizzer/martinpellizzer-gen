    "intro": "Leucaena diversifolia subsp. trichandra, commonly known as the slender leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage and erosion control. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability make it a valuable species in agroforestry systems."
