It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Lupinus huariacus is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil in its native habitat."
