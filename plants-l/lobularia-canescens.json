    "intro": "Lobularia canescens, commonly known as sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Lobularia canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
