    "intro": "Lyonia calycosa, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round cover in its natural habitat. Lyonia calycosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
