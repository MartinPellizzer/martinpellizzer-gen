    "intro": "Lonicera orientalis var. kachkarovii, commonly known as the Kachkarovii honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its ability to attract pollinators."
