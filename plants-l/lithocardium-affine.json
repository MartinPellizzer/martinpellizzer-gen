    "intro": "Lithocardium affine, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, silky hair. Lithocardium affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
