It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, green, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and has a spreading growth habit that allows it to colonize new spaces rapidly. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
