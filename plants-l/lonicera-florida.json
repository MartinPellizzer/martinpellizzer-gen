    "intro": "Lonicera florida, commonly known as the trumpet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Lonicera florida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
