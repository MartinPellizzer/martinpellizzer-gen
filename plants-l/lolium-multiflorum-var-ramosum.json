It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its rapid growth and high biomass production, making it a common choice for forage and turfgrass. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in agricultural and horticultural settings. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands."
