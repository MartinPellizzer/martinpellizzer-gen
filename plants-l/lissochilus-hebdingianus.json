    "intro": "Lissochilus hebdingianus, commonly known as the Hebding's hairroot, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, delicate orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is notable for its fine, thread-like structures, which contribute to its common name. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lissochilus hebdingianus is considered a rare and endangered species."
