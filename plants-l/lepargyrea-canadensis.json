    "intro": "Lepargyrea canadensis, commonly known as Canada lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woods and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Canada lespedeza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
