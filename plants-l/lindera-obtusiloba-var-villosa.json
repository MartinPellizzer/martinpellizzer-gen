    "intro": "Lindera obtusiloba var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy-leaf sweet pepper, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. The varietal name 'villosa' refers to its hairy foliage, distinguishing it from other varieties of Lindera obtusiloba."
