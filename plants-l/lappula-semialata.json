    "intro": "Lappula semialata, commonly known as the slender lappula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose spikes and bloom in early summer. The seeds are enclosed in small, bladder-like structures that aid in wind dispersal."
