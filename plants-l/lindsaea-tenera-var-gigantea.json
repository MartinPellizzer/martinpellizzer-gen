    "intro": "Lindsaea tenera var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant lace fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. The plant features long, slender, and often arching leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. The varietal form 'gigantea' distinguishes it from the standard L. tenera by its significantly larger size and more elaborate frond structure."
