    "intro": "Lepidaploa trilectorum, commonly known as the three-leaved lepidaploa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often arranged in a triangular pattern, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
