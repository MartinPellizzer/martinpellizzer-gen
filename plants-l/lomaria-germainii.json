    "intro": "Lomaria germainii, commonly known as the Germain's lomatia, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
