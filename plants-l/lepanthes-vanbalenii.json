    "intro": "Lepanthes vanbalenii, commonly known as the Vanbalen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, typically white, yellow, or green. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. Lepanthes vanbalenii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
