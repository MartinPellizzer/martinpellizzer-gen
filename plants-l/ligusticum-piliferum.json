    "intro": "Ligusticum piliferum, commonly known as the hairy ligusticum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its rhizomes and roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Ligusticum piliferum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassy areas."
