    "intro": "Lychnophoriopsis candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, upright fronds that resemble a candlestick, with a central stem and multiple branching leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Lychnophoriopsis candelabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
