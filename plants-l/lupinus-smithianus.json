    "intro": "Lupinus smithianus, commonly known as Smith's lupine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. Lupinus smithianus plays an important role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
