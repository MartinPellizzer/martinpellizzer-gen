    "intro": "Lipschitziella ceratocarpa var. depressa, commonly known as the depressed horned shieldfern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense mats on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds, and the species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern."
