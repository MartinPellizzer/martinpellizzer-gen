    "intro": "Leptothrium senegalense, commonly known as the Senegalese fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in the wetlands of West Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Leptothrium senegalense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to the overall biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
