    "intro": "Lepidoturus, commonly known as the African catfish, is a genus of ray-finned fish belonging to the family Clariidae. These fish are characterized by their elongated bodies, barbels, and the presence of a modified air bladder used for gas exchange. They are native to freshwater habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, often inhabiting slow-moving rivers and swamps. Lepidoturus species are typically omnivorous, feeding on small aquatic organisms, plants, and detritus. Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in low-oxygen environments, making them an important component of their ecosystem."
