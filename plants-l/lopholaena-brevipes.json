    "intro": "Lopholaena brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed lopholaena, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
