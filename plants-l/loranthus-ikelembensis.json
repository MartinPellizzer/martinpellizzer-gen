    "intro": "Loranthus ikelembensis, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a leathery texture, and it lacks true roots, relying entirely on its host for water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to tree populations."
