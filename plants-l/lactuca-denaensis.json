    "intro": "Lactuca denaensis, commonly known as the Denaensis lettuce, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Middle East and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of elongated, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white to pale brown seeds. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, showing some degree of drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
