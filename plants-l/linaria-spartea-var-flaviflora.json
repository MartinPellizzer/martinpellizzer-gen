    "intro": "Linaria spartea var. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, ribbed seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
