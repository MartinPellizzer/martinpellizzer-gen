    "intro": "Lantana origanoides, commonly known as shrub lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, featuring dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer. Lantana origanoides thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
