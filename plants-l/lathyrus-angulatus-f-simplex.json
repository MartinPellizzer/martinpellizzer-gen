    "intro": "Lathyrus angulatus f. simplex, commonly known as the simple-flowered grass vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, twisted pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in sandy or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
