    "intro": "Lepanthes ornithocephala, commonly known as the bird-headed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a bird's head, with a bright yellow or orange corolla. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. The orchid produces small, greenish or white flowers that bloom during the warmer months."
