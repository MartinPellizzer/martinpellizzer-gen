    "intro": "Lotus arenarius var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf desert lotus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is found in regions with extreme temperature fluctuations. Its seed pods are woody and contain several small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
