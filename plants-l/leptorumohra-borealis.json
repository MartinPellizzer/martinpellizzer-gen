    "intro": "Leptorumohra borealis, commonly known as the northern leptorumohra, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, with small, needle-like leaves adapted to withstand extreme cold. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind pollination due to the absence of insects in its habitat. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to anchor firmly in the permafrost and absorb nutrients from the thin layer of soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Leptorumohra borealis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
