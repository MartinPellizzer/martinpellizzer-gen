    "intro": "Lepismium epiphyllanthoides, commonly known as the Mexican ghost plant, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for foliage, which are actually modified stems used for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among succulent enthusiasts."
