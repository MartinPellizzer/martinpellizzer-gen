It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
