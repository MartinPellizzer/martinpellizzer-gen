    "intro": "Lophion aduncum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth lophion, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Lophion aduncum var. glabrum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded garden settings."
