    "intro": "Laserpitium thalictrifolium, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale blue or white, and they are arranged in loose clusters at the top of the stems. Laserpitium thalictrifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
