    "intro": "Limnophila serrata, commonly known as the water thyme, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spikes, often floating on the water surface. Limnophila serrata is commonly found in shallow water bodies and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
