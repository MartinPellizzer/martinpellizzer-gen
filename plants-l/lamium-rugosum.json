    "intro": "Lamium rugosum, commonly known as spotted deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and have distinctive purple or reddish markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Lamium rugosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
