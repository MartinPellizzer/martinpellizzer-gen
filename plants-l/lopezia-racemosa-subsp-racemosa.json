    "intro": "Lopezia racemosa subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often trifoliate, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water."
