    "intro": "Lepidium apterum, commonly known as the smooth wall peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods, and the plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Lepidium apterum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to survive in arid conditions."
