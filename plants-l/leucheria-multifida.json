    "intro": "Leucheria multifida, commonly known as the fringed leechwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in dense inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Leucheria multifida is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
