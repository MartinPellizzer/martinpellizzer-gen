    "intro": "Limonium milleri, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Limonium milleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
