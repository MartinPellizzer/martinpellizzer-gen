    "intro": "Liparophyllum exiguum, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows in rocky, coastal environments and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
