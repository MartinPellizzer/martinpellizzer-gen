    "intro": "Limodorum trabutianum var. thracum, commonly known as the Thrace lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
