    "intro": "Lagoseris taurica, commonly known as the Crimean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of the Caucasus and Crimea. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Lagoseris taurica is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas."
