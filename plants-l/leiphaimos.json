    "intro": "Leiphaimos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Leiphaimos thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its rare ability to produce light through a specialized chemical reaction in its petals."
