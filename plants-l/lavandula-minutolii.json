    "intro": "Lavandula minutolii, commonly known as the dwarf lavender, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces spikes of fragrant, lavender-blue flowers. This species is characterized by its small size, typically reaching only 30\u201360 cm in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
