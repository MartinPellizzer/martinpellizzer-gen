    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. borbonicum, commonly known as the Bourbon clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
