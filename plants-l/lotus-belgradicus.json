    "intro": "Lotus belgradicus, commonly known as the Belgrade lotus, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Balkan region. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and showy pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, while its stems are flexible to accommodate water currents. The Belgrade lotus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
