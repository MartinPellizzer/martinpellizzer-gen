    "intro": "Lastrea floridana, commonly known as the Florida lastrea, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water bodies, such as swamps and marshes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Lastrea floridana is considered a species of conservation concern."
