    "intro": "Lycopodium herterianum, commonly known as the Herter's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Lycopodium herterianum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
