    "intro": "Ledum palustre f. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate Labrador tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to boreal and subarctic regions. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, including arylacetoglycosides, which have historically been used in traditional medicine. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground."
