    "intro": "Leucopogon unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided heath, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, preferring acidic conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
