    "intro": "Linaria broussonetii, commonly known as the Broussonet's toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow-orange tubular flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Linaria broussonetii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
