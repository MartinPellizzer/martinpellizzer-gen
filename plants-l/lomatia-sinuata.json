    "intro": "Lomatia sinuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lomatia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Lomatia sinuata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
