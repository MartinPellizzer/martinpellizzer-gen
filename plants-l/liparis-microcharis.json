    "intro": "Liparis microcharis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. It has a short rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade."
