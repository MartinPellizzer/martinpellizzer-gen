    "intro": "Leiothrix nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble clouds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spores are released from the undersides of its leaves. Leiothrix nubigena is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
