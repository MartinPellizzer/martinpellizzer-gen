    "intro": "Lonicera morrowii, commonly known as Morrow's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its red, orange, or yellow berries that develop after the flowering season. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
