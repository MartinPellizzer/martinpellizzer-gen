    "intro": "Liparis giraldiana, commonly known as the Giraldian orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or humus-rich soil. Liparis giraldiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
