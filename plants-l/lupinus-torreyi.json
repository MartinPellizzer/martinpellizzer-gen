    "intro": "Lupinus torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's lupine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Lupinus torreyi plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
