    "intro": "Loranthus sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis through its spherical, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain sticky seeds. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
