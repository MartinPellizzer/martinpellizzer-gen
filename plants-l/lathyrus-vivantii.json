It features slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. Lathyrus vivantii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and resilience in various soil conditions."
