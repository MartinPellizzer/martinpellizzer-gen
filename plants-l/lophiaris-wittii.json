    "intro": "Lophiaris wittii, commonly known as the desert flatworm, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Lophiaris wittii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
