It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features closely packed, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of translucent cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically clustered at the tips of the leafy shoots. This species is often found in rocky crevices or on damp soil in temperate regions."
