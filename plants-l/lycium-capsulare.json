    "intro": "Lycium capsulare, commonly known as the Chinese boxthorn, is a shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Lycium capsulare thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to dry climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
