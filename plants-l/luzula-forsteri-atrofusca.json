It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The dark purple to blackish coloration of its flowers and bracts gives it its distinctive appearance."
