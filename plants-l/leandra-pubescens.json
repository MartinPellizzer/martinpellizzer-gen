It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
