    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. eriostachys, commonly known as the club moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more densely packed strobila compared to the typical form of Lycopodium clavatum."
