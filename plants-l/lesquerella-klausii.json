    "intro": "Lesquerella klausii, commonly known as the Clausius lesquerella, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Lesquerella klausii produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
