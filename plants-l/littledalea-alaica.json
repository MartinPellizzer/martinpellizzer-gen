    "intro": "Littledalea alaica, commonly known as the Alaska pink, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in areas with strong coastal winds. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Littledalea alaica is considered a vulnerable species."
