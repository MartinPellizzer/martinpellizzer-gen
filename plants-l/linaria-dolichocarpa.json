    "intro": "Linaria dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed toadflax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are tubular in shape, resembling those of other members of the Plantaginaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Linaria dolichocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
