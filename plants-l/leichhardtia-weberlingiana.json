    "intro": "Leichhardtia weberlingiana, commonly known as the silky leichhardtia, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a basal rosette of broad, silvery-green, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
