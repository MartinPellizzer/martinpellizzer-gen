    "intro": "Leucopogon pilifer, commonly known as the hairy leucopogon, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. Leucopogon pilifer thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
