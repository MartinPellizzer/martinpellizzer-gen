It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cooler, moist conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
