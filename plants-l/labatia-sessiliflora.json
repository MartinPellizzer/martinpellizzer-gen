    "intro": "Labatia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved labatia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, and are often ovate to elliptic in shape. The flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds."
