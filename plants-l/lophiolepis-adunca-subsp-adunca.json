    "intro": "Lophiolepis adunca subsp. adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
