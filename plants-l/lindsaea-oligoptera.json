    "intro": "Lindsaea oligoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Lindsaea oligoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
