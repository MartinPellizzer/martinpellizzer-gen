It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are short and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
