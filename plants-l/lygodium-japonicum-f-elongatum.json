    "intro": "Lygodium japonicum f. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sword fern, is a variant of the Japanese climbing fern. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant features a network of aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
