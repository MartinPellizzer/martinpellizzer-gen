    "intro": "Lythrum salicaria f. brevistyla, commonly known as narrow-stem lythrum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that are shorter than the typical form of Lythrum salicaria, giving it a more compact appearance. The plant produces spikes of deep red to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its striking color and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
