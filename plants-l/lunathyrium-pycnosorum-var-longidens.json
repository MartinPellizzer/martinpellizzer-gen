    "intro": "Lunathyrium pycnosorum var. longidens, commonly known as the dense-stemmed moonflower, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom at night. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
