    "intro": "Lathyrus setifolius f. majoriflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered grass pea, is a variant of the grass pea plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and long, slender stems that often branch towards the top. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers are typically pale blue to purple, with a distinctive spurred shape, and bloom in clusters along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds, though caution is advised due to the potential toxicity of its seeds."
