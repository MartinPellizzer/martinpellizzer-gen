    "intro": "Lamourouxia stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. The flowers are often pollinated by small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
