    "intro": "Lilium nanum var. brevistylum, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a slight fragrance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in a basal rosette, and it produces a short, upright stem that bears the flowering stalk. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
