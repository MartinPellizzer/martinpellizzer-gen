    "intro": "Lachemilla costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican lichen moss, is a unique plant belonging to the plantain family, Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming low-growing cushions or mats on the forest floor. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments, typically in cloud forests and humid lowland regions. Its foliage is typically rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis efficiently in low-light conditions. Lachemilla costaricensis plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
