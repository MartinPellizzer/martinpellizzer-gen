    "intro": "Linconia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. The plant features compact, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and covered in fine, whitish hairs. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or white and bloom in late spring to early summer. Linconia ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
