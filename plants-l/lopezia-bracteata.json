It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.

It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
