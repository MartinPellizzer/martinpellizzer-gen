It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange-red. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant bears small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
