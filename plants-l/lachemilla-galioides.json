    "intro": "Lachemilla galioides, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Lachemilla galioides thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
