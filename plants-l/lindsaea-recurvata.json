    "intro": "Lindsaea recurvata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that form a dense, cascading appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Lindsaea recurvata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, shaded environments."
