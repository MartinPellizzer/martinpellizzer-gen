    "intro": "Lepidium meyenii var. affine, commonly known as Peruvian ginseng, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, round seeds that are typically dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability to high-altitude environments, it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil."
