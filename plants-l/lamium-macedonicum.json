    "intro": "Lamium macedonicum, commonly known as Macedonian deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
