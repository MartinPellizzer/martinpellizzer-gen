    "intro": "Lilium croceum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the golden lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. These bulbils are small, round, and often clustered at the base of the flower stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
