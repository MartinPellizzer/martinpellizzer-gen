    "intro": "Lobelia caeciliae, commonly known as the Caecilia's lobelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that disperse via wind. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Lobelia caeciliae is considered a rare and endangered species."
