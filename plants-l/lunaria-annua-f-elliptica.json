It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped seed pods that turn a striking blue-violet color when mature. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that open in the evening. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value and unique seed pods that resemble silver coins."
