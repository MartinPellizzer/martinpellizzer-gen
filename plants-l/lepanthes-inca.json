    "intro": "Lepanthes inca, commonly known as the Inca orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and often feature intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Lepanthes inca is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
