    "intro": "Lupinus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pea-like, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Lupinus sylvestris is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
