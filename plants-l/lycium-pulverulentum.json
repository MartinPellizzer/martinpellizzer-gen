    "intro": "Lycium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty lycium, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. The plant is characterized by its greyish, almost dusty appearance, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Lycium pulverulentum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited."
