    "intro": "Linaria microcalyx subsp. ebelii, commonly known as the Ebel's toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
