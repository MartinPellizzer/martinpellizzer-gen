    "intro": "Lotus longisiliquosus, commonly known as the long-seeded water lotus, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The fruit of the plant is a cylindrical pod that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
