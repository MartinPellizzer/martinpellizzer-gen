    "intro": "Ligularia fischeri var. megalorhiza, commonly known as the giant ligularia, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in a tall, spiky inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its impressive size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic foliage plant."
