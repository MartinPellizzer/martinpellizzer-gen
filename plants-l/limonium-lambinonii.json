    "intro": "Limonium lambinonii, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Limonium lambinonii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators make it both ornamental and ecologically beneficial."
