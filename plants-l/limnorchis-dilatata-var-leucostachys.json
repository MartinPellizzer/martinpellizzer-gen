    "intro": "Limnorchis dilatata var. leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread and survival in aquatic habitats. The variety leucostachys is distinguished by its lighter-colored floral clusters compared to other varieties of Limnorchis dilatata."
