    "intro": "Leucocroton moncadae, commonly known as the Moncada's leucocroton, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
