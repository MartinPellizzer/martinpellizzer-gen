    "intro": "Lobelia camptodon, commonly known as the zigzag lobelia, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, hence its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Lobelia camptodon thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
