    "intro": "Lantana camara f. rubelloflavescens, commonly known as the red-flowered lantana, is a compact shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
