    "intro": "Lapathum viride, commonly known as green hedge woundwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom from June to August. Lapathum viride is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
