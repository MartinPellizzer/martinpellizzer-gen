It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves that aid in photosynthesis and water conservation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Lupinus stipulatus var. liberalis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil for other plants."
