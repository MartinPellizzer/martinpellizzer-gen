    "intro": "Lepidium didymum, commonly known as peppergrass, is an annual flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and covered in fine hairs. Peppergrass thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. It is known for its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates, compounds also found in other members of its family."
