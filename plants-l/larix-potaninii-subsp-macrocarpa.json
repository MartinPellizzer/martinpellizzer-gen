    "intro": "Larix potaninii subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Siberian larch, is a deciduous conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden before falling in autumn, and its cones that mature in the second year. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a slender trunk and a conical crown. Its wood is light, soft, and resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
