    "intro": "Linkia saccata, commonly known as the sac-like sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, sac-like calyx that encloses the flower. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, often on coral reefs or rocky substrates, and thrives in shallow, warm waters. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the day, attracting various pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its marine environment, providing habitat and food for small aquatic organisms."
