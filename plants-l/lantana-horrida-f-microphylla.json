    "intro": "Lantana horrida f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved lantana, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage and flowering habits make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in warm climates."
