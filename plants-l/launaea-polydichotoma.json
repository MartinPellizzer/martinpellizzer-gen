    "intro": "Launaea polydichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched launaea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypselae. Launaea polydichotoma is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures."
