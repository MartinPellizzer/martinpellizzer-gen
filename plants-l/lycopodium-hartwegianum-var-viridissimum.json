    "intro": "Lycopodium hartwegianum var. viridissimum, commonly known as the Hartwig's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along rocky stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
