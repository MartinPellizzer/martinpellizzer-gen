    "intro": "Lupinus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lupine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its upright, spindly growth habit and produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Lupinus alpestris thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
