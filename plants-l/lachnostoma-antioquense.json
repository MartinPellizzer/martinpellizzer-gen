    "intro": "Lachnostoma antioquense, commonly known as the Antioquian lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its intricate thallus structure, which is typically crustose and covers the substrate in a thin, uniform layer. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, often with a distinctive central area that is darker in hue. It is primarily found in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops, where it thrives on bark or soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
