    "intro": "Lavandula carnosa, commonly known as the woolly lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that feels woolly to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its aromatic properties, it is also used in perfumery and herbal remedies."
