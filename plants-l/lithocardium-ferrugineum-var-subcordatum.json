    "intro": "Lithocardium ferrugineum var. subcordatum, commonly known as the red sandstone lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives on rocky substrates, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its bright orange to reddish thallus, which is rich in pigments such as rhodinines. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in regions with high solar exposure and low humidity. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered an indicator species for certain types of rocky habitats."
