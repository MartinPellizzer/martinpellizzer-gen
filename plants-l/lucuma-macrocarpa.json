    "intro": "Lucuma macrocarpa, commonly known as the golden apple or lucuma, is a species of tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its large, yellow-orange, sweet, and creamy fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when it is fully mature and has a hard, spiky exterior. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is valued not only for its unique flavor but also for its nutritional content, including high levels of vitamin C and dietary fiber."
