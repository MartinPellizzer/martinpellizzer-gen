    "intro": "Lepidagathis eucephala var. zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's lepidagathis, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
