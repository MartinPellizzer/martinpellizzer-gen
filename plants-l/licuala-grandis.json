    "intro": "Licuala grandis, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its large, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaf sheaths. Its fibrous trunk and robust foliage make it well-suited for coastal and humid environments. Licuala grandis is often used in traditional crafts for its strong, fibrous leaves."
