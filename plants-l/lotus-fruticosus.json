    "intro": "Lotus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping lotus or wild lotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its sprawling, creeping growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Lotus fruticosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
