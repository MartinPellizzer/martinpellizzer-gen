    "intro": "Lycopodium springianum, commonly known as the Spring's clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing cones and needle-like leaves, which are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of its ancient lineage. Lycopodium springianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
