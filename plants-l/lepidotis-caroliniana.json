    "intro": "Lepidotis caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina lespedeza, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Lepidotis caroliniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
