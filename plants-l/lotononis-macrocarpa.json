It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
