    "intro": "Liabum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Liabum hirtum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
