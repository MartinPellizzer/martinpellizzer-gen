    "intro": "Lycopodium chrysocaulos, commonly known as the golden club, is a rare and striking fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with golden-yellow spore-bearing cones. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rich forest floors, often found in areas with high humidity. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations at the tips of the fronds. Lycopodium chrysocaulos plays an important ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of understory plant communities."
