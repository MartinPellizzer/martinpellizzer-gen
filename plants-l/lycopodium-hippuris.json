    "intro": "Lycopodium hippuris, commonly known as the ground pine, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that resemble pine needles. It is a perennial evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and rocky areas. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the stems, a feature typical of many clubmosses. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic properties. L. hippuris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
