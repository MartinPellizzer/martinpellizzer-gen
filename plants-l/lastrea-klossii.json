    "intro": "Lastrea klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's lastrea, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in the humid, tropical rainforests where it thrives. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a smooth texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Lastrea klossii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
