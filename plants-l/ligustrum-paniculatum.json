    "intro": "Ligustrum paniculatum, commonly known as the fragrant privet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in terminal panicles during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
