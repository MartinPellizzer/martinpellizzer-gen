It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Limonium artruchium is a perennial species that blooms in summer, producing clusters of small, showy flowers. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
