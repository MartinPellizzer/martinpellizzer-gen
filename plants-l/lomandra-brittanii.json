    "intro": "Lomandra brittanii, commonly known as the coastal lomandra, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Lomandra brittanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought resistance in landscaping."
