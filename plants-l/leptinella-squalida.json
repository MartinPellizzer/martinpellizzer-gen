    "intro": "Leptinella squalida, commonly known as the squalid leaptinella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
