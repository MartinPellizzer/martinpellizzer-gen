    "intro": "Lasiochloa hirta, commonly known as the hairy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Lasiochloa hirta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
