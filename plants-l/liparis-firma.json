    "intro": "Liparis firma, commonly known as the firm orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soil. The plant features erect, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies over time. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
