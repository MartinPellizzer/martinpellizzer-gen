    "intro": "Licuala tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves can reach up to 2 meters in diameter, making it a dramatic addition to tropical landscapes. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
