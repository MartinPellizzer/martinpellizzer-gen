    "intro": "Lantana capensis, commonly known as the common lantana, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant is shrub-like, with opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
