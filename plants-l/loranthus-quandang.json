    "intro": "Loranthus quandang, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, often white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Loranthus quandang is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
