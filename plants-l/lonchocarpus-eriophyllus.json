    "intro": "Lonchocarpus eriophyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved cowpea tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers that are followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems. However, some species within the genus are known to contain toxic compounds, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
