    "intro": "Leobordea decumbens subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping leobordea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor conditions."
