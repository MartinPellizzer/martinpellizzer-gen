It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
