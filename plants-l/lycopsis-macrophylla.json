    "intro": "Lycopsis macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved lycopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy environments. Lycopsis macrophylla is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
