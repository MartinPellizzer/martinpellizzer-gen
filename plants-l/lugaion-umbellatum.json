    "intro": "Lugaion umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive umbel-shaped inflorescence, which consists of multiple small white or pale pink flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often creeping along the ground. Lugaion umbellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
