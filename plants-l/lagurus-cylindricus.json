    "intro": "Lagurus cylindricus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of small, pale green to silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
