    "intro": "Labichea rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Labichea rupestris is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blooms and resilience to drought conditions."
