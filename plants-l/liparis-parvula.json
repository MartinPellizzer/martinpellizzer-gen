    "intro": "Liparis parvula, commonly known as the small lady's tresses, is a small orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients. Liparis parvula is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer."
