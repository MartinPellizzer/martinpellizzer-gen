    "intro": "Linaria marginata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Linaria marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, daisy-like blooms."
