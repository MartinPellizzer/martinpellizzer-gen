    "intro": "Loranthus brideliae var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the oblong-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This variant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forest ecosystems."
