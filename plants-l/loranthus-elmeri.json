    "intro": "Loranthus elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions where its host trees are abundant."
