    "intro": "Laurus divaricata, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain consistent in size throughout the plant's life. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded form, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Laurus divaricata prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, thriving in temperate climates."
