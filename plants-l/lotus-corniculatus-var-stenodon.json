    "intro": "Lotus corniculatus var. stenodon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ecological importance as a nitrogen-fixing plant that supports soil fertility."
