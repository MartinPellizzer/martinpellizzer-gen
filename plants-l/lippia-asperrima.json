It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Lippia asperrima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
