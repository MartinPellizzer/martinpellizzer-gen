    "intro": "Lychnis lagascae, commonly known as the alpine sandpink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems. Lychnis lagascae is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
