    "intro": "Lycium tenue, commonly known as silverberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It is well adapted to dry environments and can thrive in poor soils. Lycium tenue is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
