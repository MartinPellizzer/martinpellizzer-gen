    "intro": "Lachnagrostis gussonis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune environments. Lachnagrostis gussonis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
