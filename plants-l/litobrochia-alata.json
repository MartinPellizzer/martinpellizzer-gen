    "intro": "Litobrochia alata, commonly known as the winged rock cress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Litobrochia alata is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme weather conditions."
