It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Lippia attenuata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
