It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
