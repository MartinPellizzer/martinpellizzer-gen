    "intro": "Leptothrium lineare, commonly known as the linear fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds."
