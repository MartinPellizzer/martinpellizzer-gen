    "intro": "Liriodendron tulipifera, commonly known as the tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tulip-shaped yellow-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree's leaves are large, palmately lobed, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The tulip tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
