    "intro": "Lilium davidii var. willmottiae, commonly known as the Willmott's lily, is a rare and striking variation of the David lily. It is native to the mountainous regions of central China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive red-orange stamen, typically blooming in late summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
