    "intro": "Leptocarpus asper, commonly known as the rough-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a creeping growth habit with woody stems that can form dense mats. Leptocarpus asper is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
