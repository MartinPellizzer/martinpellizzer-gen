    "intro": "Lupinus olive-nortonae, commonly known as the Olive Norton lupine, is a species native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
