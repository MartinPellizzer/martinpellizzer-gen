    "intro": "Limonium grubovii, commonly known as the pink sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium grubovii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray, which is particularly useful in maritime environments."
