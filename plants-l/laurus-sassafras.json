    "intro": "Laurus sassafras, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three leaflets with one being larger than the other. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. Its roots and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
