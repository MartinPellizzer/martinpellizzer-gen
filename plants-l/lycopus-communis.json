    "intro": "Lycopus communis, commonly known as blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Lycopus communis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
