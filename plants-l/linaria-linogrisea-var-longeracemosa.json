    "intro": "Linaria linogrisea var. longeracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme linaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its longer inflorescences compared to the typical form, which enhances its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
