    "intro": "Lupinus acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem lupine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems that are often hairless, hence the species name *acaulis*. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Lupinus acaulis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
