It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically lyre-shaped, giving it its common name. Lepidium lyratum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is also known for its peppery scent and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
