    "intro": "Loranthus repandus, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Loranthus repandus is found in tropical and subtropical regions and is often used in traditional medicine."
