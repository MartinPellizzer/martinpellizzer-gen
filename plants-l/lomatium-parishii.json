    "intro": "Lomatium parishii, commonly known as the Parish's lomatium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. Native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in complex umbels that bloom in late spring to early summer. Lomatium parishii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
