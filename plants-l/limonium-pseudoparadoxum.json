    "intro": "Limonium pseudoparadoxum, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. It is often found in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Limonium pseudoparadoxum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
