    "intro": "Lycopodium clavatum var. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form tight, bushy clusters. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. This variety is native to North America, particularly in the Laurentian region, and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
