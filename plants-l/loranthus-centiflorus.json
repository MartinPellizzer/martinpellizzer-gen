    "intro": "Loranthus centiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to host trees through its haustoria, drawing water and nutrients from the host. It is native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found on eucalyptus, acacia, and other broadleaf trees. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, and it is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
