    "intro": "Lepicephalus decurrens, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its creeping habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in gardens. Lepicephalus decurrens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to Mediterranean climates."
