It features showy, tubular, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
