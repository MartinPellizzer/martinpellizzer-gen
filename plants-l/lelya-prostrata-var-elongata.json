    "intro": "Lelya prostrata var. elongata, commonly known as the creeping lelya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bright green color that can turn reddish in full sun. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
