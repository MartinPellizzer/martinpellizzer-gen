    "intro": "Laportea grossedentata, commonly known as the broad-toothed ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated margins, and the plant is often found in moist to wet habitats like swamps and woodland edges. Laportea grossedentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
