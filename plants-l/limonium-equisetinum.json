    "intro": "Limonium equisetinum, commonly known as sea helene, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Limonium equisetinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
