    "intro": "Lycopodium indicum, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing cones and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a long, creeping stem that produces upright, leaf-like structures called microphylls. Lycopodium indicum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forests and wetlands. Its historical use in traditional medicine and its role in ecological systems highlight its botanical significance."
