    "intro": "Lyonia popowii, commonly known as the rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is well adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Lyonia popowii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
