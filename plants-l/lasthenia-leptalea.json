    "intro": "Lasthenia leptalea, commonly known as the slender rayless goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
