    "intro": "Lepidagathis incana, commonly known as the woolly lepidagathis, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are often glandular and may emit a mild fragrance, which can attract certain pollinators. Lepidagathis incana is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
