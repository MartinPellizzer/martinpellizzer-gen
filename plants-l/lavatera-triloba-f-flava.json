    "intro": "Lavatera triloba f. flava, commonly known as the yellow lavatera, is a flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of branches. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, hairy foliage, and a preference for well-drained, sunny locations. The yellow coloration of its flowers is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
