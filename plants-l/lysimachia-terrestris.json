    "intro": "Lysimachia terrestris, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Lysimachia terrestris thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
