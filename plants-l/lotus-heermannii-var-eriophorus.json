    "intro": "Lotus heermannii var. eriophorus, commonly known as the Hermann's lotus, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
