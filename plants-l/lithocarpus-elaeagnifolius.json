    "intro": "Lithocarpus elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, inedible nuts enclosed in a woody cupule, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
