    "intro": "Luffa aegyptiaca var. peramara, commonly known as the sponge gourd or loofah, is a tropical vine native to Africa and widely cultivated for its fibrous fruit. The plant produces large, inflated gourds that mature into spongy, fibrous structures used for scrubbing. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while the stems are hairy and trailing. The fruit develops in clusters and requires a long growing season to reach maturity. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight."
