    "intro": "Lomatium dasycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruit lomatium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by oval, spiny fruits that contain the seeds. Lomatium dasycarpum is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
