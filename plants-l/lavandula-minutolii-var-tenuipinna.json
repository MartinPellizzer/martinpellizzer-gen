    "intro": "Lavandula minutolii var. tenuipinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lavender, is a rare and diminutive member of the Lavandula genus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, upright growth with narrow, silver-green leaves and spikes of small, fragrant purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a mild, herbaceous scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
