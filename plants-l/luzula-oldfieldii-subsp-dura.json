    "intro": "Luzula oldfieldii subsp. dura, commonly known as Oldfield's wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. The subspecies dura is distinguished by its slightly more robust growth and slightly longer leaves compared to other forms of Luzula oldfieldii."
