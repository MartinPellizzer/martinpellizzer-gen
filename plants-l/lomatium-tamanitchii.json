It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, particularly found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, dry fruits. Its leaves are fern-like, with finely divided lobes, and the plant has a fibrous root system. Lomatium tamanitchii is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
