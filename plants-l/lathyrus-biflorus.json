    "intro": "Lathyrus biflorus, commonly known as the twin-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods containing several elliptical, brown seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Lathyrus biflorus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
