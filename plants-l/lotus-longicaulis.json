    "intro": "Lotus longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed water lily, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to support its weight on the water's surface. The flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
