    "intro": "Lastrea decursive-pinnata, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments. It features a prostrate growth habit with thin, flexible stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
