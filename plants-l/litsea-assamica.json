    "intro": "Litsea assamica, commonly known as Assam laurel, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, simple leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
