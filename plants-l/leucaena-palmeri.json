    "intro": "Leucaena palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are usually bright green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Leucaena palmeri is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
