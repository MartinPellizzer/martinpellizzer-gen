    "intro": "Lathyrus luteus subsp. ochraceus, commonly known as the yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The subspecies ochraceus is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Lathyrus luteus."
