    "intro": "Lappa tomentosa var. denudata, commonly known as the naked lappa, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal purposes due to their high content of compounds like lappa lactone. The variety denudata is distinguished by its reduced leaf hair, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form."
