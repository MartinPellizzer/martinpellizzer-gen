    "intro": "Lindsaea simulans, commonly known as the false spurge fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that often form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-bearing structures called sori located on the underside. Lindsaea simulans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
