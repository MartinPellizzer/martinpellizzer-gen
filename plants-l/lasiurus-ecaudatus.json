    "intro": "Lasiurus ecaudatus, commonly known as the southern red bat, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a reddish hue when mature, contributing to its common name. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
