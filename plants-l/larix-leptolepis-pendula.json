    "intro": "Larix leptolepis pendula, commonly known as the weeping Japanese larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving the tree a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its needle-like leaves are bright green in summer and turn golden in autumn before falling. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and seasonal color changes."
