    "intro": "Leiphaimos aphylla, commonly known as the leafless leigha, is a unique plant species characterized by its lack of leaves. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils in Mediterranean climates."
