    "intro": "Lapsanastrum humile, commonly known as lesser hawk's-beard, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and often have a rough texture. Lapsanastrum humile is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
