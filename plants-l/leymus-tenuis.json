    "intro": "Leymus tenuis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine, delicate appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Leymus tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil."
