    "intro": "Lafoensia densiflora var. callosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved lafoensia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, flaky foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically leathery and covered in a rough, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
