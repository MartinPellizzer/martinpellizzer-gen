    "intro": "Landolphia stipulosa, commonly known as the African arrowroot or the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bells. The plant has a thick, succulent stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Landolphia stipulosa is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
