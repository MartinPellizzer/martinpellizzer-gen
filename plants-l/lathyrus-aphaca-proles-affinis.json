    "intro": "Lathyrus aphaca proles affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop."
