    "intro": "Lonicera etrusca f. gigantea, commonly known as the Etruscan honeysuckle, is a large, vigorous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its size and growth habit, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
