    "intro": "Lindsaea subtripinnata, commonly known as the three-branched maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing new growth from nodes along their length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Lindsaea subtripinnata thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
