    "intro": "Lycopodium holtonii, commonly known as the Holton's clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species of lycophyte native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a spore-bearing cone at the tip of its stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, a key feature of its life cycle. Due to habitat loss, Lycopodium holtonii is critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
