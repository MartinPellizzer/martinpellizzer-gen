    "intro": "Luma rupestris, commonly known as the rock luma, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are clustered in umbels. Luma rupestris is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
