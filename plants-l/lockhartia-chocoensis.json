    "intro": "Lockhartia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces showy, pendulous blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
