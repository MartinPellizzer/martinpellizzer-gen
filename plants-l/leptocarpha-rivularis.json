It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along streams, rivers, and lake margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues. Leptocarpha rivularis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
