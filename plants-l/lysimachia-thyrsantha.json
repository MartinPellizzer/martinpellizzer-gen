It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Lysimachia thyrsantha thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
