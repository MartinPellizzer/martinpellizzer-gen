    "intro": "Leucojum autumnale, commonly known as the autumn snowflake, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of sheaths. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive through winter dormancy. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in woodland or shaded garden settings."
