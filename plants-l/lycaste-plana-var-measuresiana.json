    "intro": "Lycaste plana var. measuresiana, commonly known as the Measures' Lycaste, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces pseudobulbs, which are covered in a velvety, dark green leaf sheath. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf that is often shorter than the pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, with a distinct lip that is usually darker in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
