    "intro": "Lycopodium brachystachyum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Lycopodium brachystachyum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
