    "intro": "Lannea schimperi var. stolzii, commonly known as the African bristlecone, is a rare and woody shrub or small tree native to the dry savannas of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
