    "intro": "Licaria subbullata, commonly known as the woolly licaria, is a small shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture. Licaria subbullata is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in limestone soils."
