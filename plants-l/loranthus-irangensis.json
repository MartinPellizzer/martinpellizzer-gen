It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. The plant has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. The berries it bears are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds."
