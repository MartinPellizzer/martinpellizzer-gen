    "intro": "Loranthus avium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees such as oaks and apple trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are a food source for birds that help disperse its seeds. Loranthus avium plays a unique ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing both its host trees and wildlife populations."
