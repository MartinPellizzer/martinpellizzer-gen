It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble clouds, which are composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often covered in a soft, hairy coating. Lipocarpha squarrosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
