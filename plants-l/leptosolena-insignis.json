    "intro": "Leptosolena insignis, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is an evergreen vine that can climb using its tendrils, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration."
