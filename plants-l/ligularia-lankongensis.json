    "intro": "Ligularia lankongensis, commonly known as the Lankong giantleaf, is a striking perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the end of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountain forests and along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
