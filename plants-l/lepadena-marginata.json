    "intro": "Lepadena marginata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, often with a waxy coating, and are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Lepadena marginata is also known for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it a common feature of coastal landscapes."
