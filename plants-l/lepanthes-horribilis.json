    "intro": "Lepanthes horribilis, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red to purple flowers that resemble blood, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Lepanthes horribilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
