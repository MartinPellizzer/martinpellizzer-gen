    "intro": "Lathyrus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Lathyrus hispidulus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
