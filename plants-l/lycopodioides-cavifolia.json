    "intro": "Lycopodioides cavifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte that belongs to the family Lycopodaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants."
