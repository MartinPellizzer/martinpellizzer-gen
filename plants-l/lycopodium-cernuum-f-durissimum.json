    "intro": "Lycopodium cernuum f. durissimum, commonly known as the erect clubmoss, is a variant of the common lycopodium, characterized by its upright growth habit. It is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is notable for its spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with each stem splitting into two equal parts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
