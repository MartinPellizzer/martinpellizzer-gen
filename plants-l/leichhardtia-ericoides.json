    "intro": "Leichhardtia ericoides, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open woodlands and heathlands. Its compact growth habit and dense, shrub-like form make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Leichhardtia ericoides is often found in areas with high rainfall and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
