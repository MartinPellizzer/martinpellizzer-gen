    "intro": "Lonicera hispida var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, short hairs, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Lonicera hispida var. alpina is well adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
