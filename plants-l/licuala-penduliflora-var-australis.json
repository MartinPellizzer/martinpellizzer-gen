    "intro": "Licuala penduliflora var. australis, commonly known as the Australian umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are typically fan-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that develop into black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
