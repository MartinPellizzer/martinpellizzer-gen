    "intro": "Laelia anceps, commonly known as the showy laelia, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its harsh, mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically flowers in the spring or early summer. Laelia anceps is valued in horticulture for its beauty and adaptability to cultivation."
