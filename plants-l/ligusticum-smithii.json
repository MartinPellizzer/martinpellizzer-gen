It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications due to their pungent, celery-like flavor. Ligusticum smithii thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
