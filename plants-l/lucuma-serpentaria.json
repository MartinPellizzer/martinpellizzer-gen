    "intro": "Lucuma serpentaria, commonly known as the serpent's tail, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiraling inflorescences that resemble a serpent's tail. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
