    "intro": "Lepidium hirtum proles bonannianum, commonly known as the Bonannian peppergrass, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous vegetables and wild plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which give it its scientific name \"hirtum,\" meaning hairy. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in some areas."
