    "intro": "Leucanthemum delarbrei, commonly known as the Delarbre's white ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow disk in the center. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
