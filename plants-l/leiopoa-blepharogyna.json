    "intro": "Leiopoa blepharogyna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Leiopoa blepharogyna is native to New Zealand and is adapted to cool, moist conditions found in its natural habitat."
