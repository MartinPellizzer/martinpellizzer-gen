    "intro": "Legousia speculum-veneris subsp. pentagonia, commonly known as the Venus's looking-glass, is a rare and striking member of the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, pentagonal-shaped leaves that resemble a mirror, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialized growers."
