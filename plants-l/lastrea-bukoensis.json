    "intro": "Lastrea bukoensis, commonly known as the Buko Mountain lastrea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss, Lastrea bukoensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
